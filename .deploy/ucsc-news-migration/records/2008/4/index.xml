A professor of electrical engineering at UC Santa Cruz, Liu is a pioneer in the field of bioelectronics, collaborating with medical doctors and other researchers on ambitious projects that have already achieved remarkable results.</p>
<p>"My lab is not an ordinary electronics lab," Liu says. "In bioelectronics, we have collaborators in many different fields, from plastic surgery to neurophysiology."</p>
<p>Liu's group at UCSC is working on a variety of neural prostheses designed to communicate directly with the nervous system in patients with blindness, paralysis, spinal cord injury, and other conditions long considered incurable. Medical researchers turn to Liu not only for his expertise in electronics but also for his experience in working with clinicians to address the many challenges at the interface between biological systems and electronics.</p>
<p>Liu's work in this area began in the 1980s with a project to develop an artificial retina to restore vision in blind patients. Led by Dr. Mark Humayun, an ophthalmologist and bioengineer, Liu and other members of the team have spent years designing, testing, and refining the experimental retinal implants. In 2002, the first patient received a retinal implant and within weeks was able to see patterns of light and dark, perceive motion, and detect large objects.</p>
<p>Six patients received that first experimental retinal prosthesis, and clinical trials are now under way with a more advanced second-generation implant, with Liu's electronics at the core of the device. The ultimate goal of the project--which now involves researchers at three universities, several national laboratories, and a private company--is to give patients the ability to recognize faces and read large print.</p>
<p>"In the 1980s, the retinal prosthesis was a crazy idea," says Mohan Sivaprakasam, who earned his Ph.D. with Liu and is now a research scientist managing Liu's lab of about 20 graduate and undergraduate students. "Wentai is always looking for the next frontier. If someone says it can't be done, that's the problem he wants to work on."</p>
<p>Liu's group is now involved in efforts to develop neural prostheses for restoring mobility to patients with spinal cord injury, treating facial paralysis, and providing brain stimulation to treat chronic pain and depression. Funding, which amounts to about $1 million a year for Liu's lab, comes from a wide range of government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense.</p>
<p>According to Liu, the engineering challenges are fundamentally similar for all neural prostheses. They include minimizing the size and power requirements of the implanted device, delivering power to it without the use of penetrating wires, and managing bidirectional communication and data transmission between implanted and external components.</p>
<p>The retinal prosthesis, for example, involves a small video camera (integrated into a pair of sunglasses), external electronics to process and transmit the visual signals captured by the camera, and a tiny implant inside the eye to receive the signals and deliver electrical impulses through an array of microelectrodes that stimulate the neurons in the retina. The device can help patients blinded by diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, which affect the light receptors in the retina but not the neural wiring from the eye to the brain.</p>
<p>Dr. Kimberly Cockerham, a neurological ophthalmologist at Stanford University, began working with Liu in 2006 on an implant to stimulate paralyzed facial muscles using a combination of electrical impulses and chemical neurotransmitters. The hybrid electrochemical implant may provide more comfortable and effective muscle stimulation than electrical impulses alone, and could potentially be used to stimulate paralyzed muscles anywhere in the body.</p>
<p>"It's a device that could be modified to meet a lot of clinical needs," Cockerham says.</p>
<p>Liu's most ambitious project is an effort to restore mobility to patients with spinal cord injuries. The project involves researchers at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Arizona State University, and other institutions. The aim is to bypass the injured spinal cord and deliver signals from the brain to the muscles in the legs</p>
<p>via a prosthetic system.</p>
<p>"The hope is to enable patients to stand up and walk," Liu says. "It requires an implant to record the brain signal and transmit it outside the body, and then the signals have to be processed and transmitted back into the body to a large number of implants in the leg--and it all has to happen at very high data rates."</p>
<p>Much of the work done by Liu's group involves juggling the many competing technical requirements and constraints of devices that not only involve highly sophisticated electronics, but also must function safely inside the body and interact with living tissue. Miniaturizing and integrating the components so as to optimize the overall performance of the device is a major challenge.</p>
<p>"There's no book for this," says Sivaprakasam. "It involves a lot of back and forth between the engineers and the clinicians--that collaboration is the key for these interdisciplinary projects."</p>

Holding the computer open like a clamshell in one hand, the 21-year-old UC Santa Cruz student walked briskly into an office. Chatting with the patient waiting inside, he quickly typed up her medical history.</p>
<p>Inzunza is a student in UCSC's innovative Health Sciences program, one of the fastest-growing majors on campus and among the 10 most popular majors at UCSC despite only being established in 2003. The program--giving students hands-on experience by requiring an internship at a local or regional health-care facility--reflects the campus's commitment to help meet the future health-care needs of a growing, increasingly diverse population.</p>
<p>In addition to an internship, UCSC's Health Sciences students must complete both a Spanish-language and a writing requirement.</p>
<p>Because of the internship and language requirement, students can effectively apply the knowledge they gain in the classroom to the real world, said Dr. Jeffrey Solinas, owner/director of the Plazita clinic, a privately owned family practice in the Santa Cruz County city of Watsonville.</p>
<p>"An internship was important for me when I did it," said Solinas, who earned a bachelor's degree from UCSC in 1974, as an independent-studies major. Solinas volunteered for two summers at a United Farm Workers clinic in Delano in 1976 and 1977. "It became clear that it was the best way to combine science information you could get at school with the challenges of working with people."</p>
<p>Health-care-professional schools are looking for people with just the kind of field experience the Health Sciences program provides, said Grant Hartzog, associate professor in UCSC's Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Department, who sits on the program's three-member faculty advisory committee.</p>
<p>"It's one way of measuring someone's commitment, and making sure people have a good understanding of what they're getting themselves into," said Hartzog.</p>
<p>The other distinctive characteristic of UCSC's Health Sciences curriculum is the requirement that students learn medical terminology and conversational skills in what, for many, is a new language. The internship allows them to see the day-in, day-out practice of a working health professional, and they must also hone their written communication skills and learn scientific writing conventions.</p>
<p>In addition, students have the opportunity to learn about the mechanics of the health-care industry, including the role of insurance companies.</p>
<p>"Health Sciences has allowed me to think of how to approach the system as a whole, not just the pieces," said student Ahoo Karimian, 25, who's now finishing up her final program requirements and applying to medical schools.</p>
<p><strong>A growing program to meet a growing need</strong></p>
<p>In the 2004-05 year, UCSC produced six graduates of the program, according to Hartzog. In 2005-2006 there were 29; in 2006-2007, 42. "Obviously, the numbers are going up as word spreads of our special program," Hartzog said.</p>
<p>One goal of the program is to encourage graduates to consider a career in the Monterey Bay region, where there is already a shortage of trained health-care providers, according to Hartzog.</p>
<p>The seeds for the major were sown close to the beginning of this decade. "Though the campus had a long tradition of contributing to the health-care work force through majors such as biology and anthropology, it didn't have a program catering specifically to those intending to pursue careers as health-care professionals," said Hartzog.</p>
<p>The program's founders--Professor John Tamkun and Associate Professor Lindsay Hinck, both from molecular, cell, and developmental biology--"set out to design a rigorous, high-quality program in biological sciences that would also meet the needs of people who were going to be involved in health care in California today," said Hartzog.</p>
<p>Educators see the demand for health-care providers continuing to escalate. Already the most populous state in the nation, California is expected to grow at nearly twice the national average by 2025, according to a 2005 report by the University of California assessing the state's short- and long-term health-care work-force needs. Other key findings in the report include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>California's elderly population will grow at more than twice the rate of the state's total population from 2005 to 2025.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>By 2015, more than half the state's population will be of Latino or Asian descent.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>California ranks 49th in the number of nurses per capita, and predictions indicate a shortfall of 60,000 RNs by 2020 (see graph).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><strong>Compassion from experience</strong></p>
<p>For some students, learning about the science of health care is more than an educational opportunity. It's a personal mission to help others.</p>
<p>In her second to last quarter in the program, student Karimian was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Last spring, surgeons removed her thyroid, 12 lymph nodes, and a parathyroid gland.</p>
<p>Despite her health obstacles, she was able to continue with her studies. When she chose her health-sciences internship, she went with Dr. Jennifer Choate at Cancer Research and Prevention Center of the Central Coast, in Soquel.</p>
<p>Health Sciences Coordinator Caroline Berger, who counsels and helps place students in internships at local hospitals, clinics, and other facilities, warned Karimian that her choice might strike too close to home.</p>
<p>"She said it might be difficult because people going in there are sick, and not all of them survive," said Karimian, whose is now cancer-free. "I considered that, but I felt that my experience would help me relate, and--if anything--would make me appreciate my life because I survived."</p>
<p>She had been planning to go into dermatology, but she's now considering oral surgery or oncology.</p>
<p>For student Inzunza, working with Dr. Solinas at Plazita Medical Clinic is a way of providing people with health-care services that he didn't have growing up.</p>
<p>The clinic's doctors are "dealing with the working poor, people on MediCal, and working with opiate addiction and addiction in general," said Inzunza. "I was used to seeing that when I was growing up," said Inzunza, whose parents immigrated to California from Mexico and didn't graduate from high school. "We never went to a doctor when I was younger because of money issues. I wanted to help people in situations similar to mine."</p>
<p>Both students acknowledge that the health-care field of today is fraught with complicated issues, including skyrocketing costs and dwindling access. Both are preparing themselves to enter the fray by taking <em>Clinical Health Care: Organization and Financing,</em> a class that introduces students to the principles of health-care organizations, including how they're paid for, and that examines social constructions of health care in the United States.</p>
<p>But though they're preparing to play by the current rules, the students feel change is necessary. "I definitely think we need to do something," said Inzunza. "I want to be part of making it happen."</p>

<td><strong>A helping hand for Health Sciences grads</strong>
<p>Local health-care organizations Sutter Maternity &amp; Surgery Center and Central Coast Alliance for Health partnered last year to sponsor the Primary Care Physician Award, a $10,000 scholarship meant to support graduates of the Health Sciences program who plan to focus on primary care medicine and intend to come back to the Central Coast to practice after completing medical school.<br/>
</p>
<p>The shortage of primary care physicians is a growing national problem that is exacerbated in areas such as the Central Coast by low Medicare reimbursement rates, according to Larry deGhetaldi (B.A. biology and chemistry, Merrill '76), CEO of Sutter Santa Cruz.<br/>
</p>
<p>About 10 percent of the doctors in Santa Cruz County are UCSC alumni.<br/>
</p>
<p>Allison Abresch-Meyer, who graduated from UCSC in December 2006, was the first recipient of the award.</p>

<p>Dr. Nanette Mickiewicz never got to do an internship herself. The president of Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz had her first real experience in a hospital in her second year of medical school.</p>
<p>Interns at Dominican generally shadow physicians, nurses, and physical therapists, observing them in daily activity. They also usually have a project, work on their term paper, and check in with Mickiewicz once a week. The hospital tries to help them observe as many procedures as possible.</p>
<p>To her mind, the internship component of the Health Sciences program is "a tremendous asset to our student interns, and I think they feel the same way," said Mickiewicz. "Because the opportunity to actually work with the physician and see what they do day-to-day either completely inspires them or completely deters them."</p>
<p>For doctors such as Mickiewicz, the Health Sciences program is a vital piece of the puzzle in countering the exploding demand for health-care services.</p>
<p>"Across the board in the United States, the need for health-care providers is increasing," said Mickiewicz. "I think we'll see an expansion of these programs going forward, to help people recognize all the choices that are out there."</p>

(Photo courtesy of Reuters)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Four months ago, Apple Computer flew UCSC alumnus Jesse Thorn back east to interview Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert in front of a live audience at its flagship store in New York City. Not a bad gig for a 26-year old who was thrilled to get his first show on college radio in 1999.</p>

<p>But Thorn has come a long way in a short time. <em>The Sound of Young America,</em> the irreverent arts and comedy interview show he created while a student at UCSC, was picked up in June for distribution by Public Radio International (PRI)--the same people who bring Ira Glass's award-winning <em>This American Life</em> and the BBC News to audiences each week across the country. So when the folks at Apple needed someone to host Colbert for a live podcast that would be posted as a free download on i-Tunes, Thorn got the call.</p>
<p>"Stephen Colbert is exactly the guy you hoped he would be," Thorn says by phone from his L.A. apartment, where he produces <em>The Sound of Young America</em> once a week. "He's astonishingly funny, and really thoughtful."</p>
<p>Those same words could be used to describe Thorn himself, whose persona lies somewhere between NBC's Conan O'Brien and NPR's Terry Gross. A tour-de-force of casually funny, yet in-depth "behind-the-scenes" interviews, Thorn's show features cutting-edge comics, writers, artists, and musicians. His guests range from top comedians such as Patton Oswalt, Sarah Silverman, and Paula Poundstone; to original <em>Saturday Night Live</em> writer and television producer Anne Beatts; Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman and former <em>New Yorker</em> staff writer Lawrence Wechsler; to rapper Chuck D, author Nick Hornby, and punk rocker turned TV talk-show host Henry Rollins.</p>
<p>"My goal is to have the intelligence of public radio without being self-consciously dull," says Thorn, taking a youthful jab at NPR. "I'm not personally interested in celebrity, but I'm very interested in people who make things," he adds. "In TV for example, the writer is the one whose voice is expressed. That's why I rarely book actors. Why would I talk to the actors when I could talk to the guy who thought of the idea?"</p>
<p><em>The Sound of Young America</em> was originally broadcast on the campus station KZSC while Thorn was a student at UCSC. He majored in American Studies--with a focus on expressive cultures. After graduating in 2003, Thorn applied for jobs in both public and commercial radio around the country, including NPR stations in Washington, D.C., but he couldn't catch a break. "I didn't even get interviews," he recalls. So Thorn worked at various low-level jobs for nonprofits and went through periods of unemployment, all the while continuing to produce the weekly program.</p>

<p>Near the end of 2004, <em>The Sound of Young America</em> became the first public radio show on the West Coast to begin podcasting and was spotlighted in the <em>Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine</em> and <em>Salon.com.</em> A few months later, Thorn received a call from the director of programming at PRI, who had heard one of the podcasts and expressed interest in distributing the show. Thorn heard nothing again for nearly a year.</p>
<p>But in spring of 2006, WNYC--one of the five largest public radio stations in the country--decided to air his program. It had been recommended to the station by comedian John Hodgman (now of Jon Stewart's <em>The Daily Show</em>), who had been a guest on <em>The Sound of Young America.</em> PRI was soon on board.</p>
<p>Thorn now works 50 or 60 hours a week to produce the show. He also creates a separate weekly podcast of comedy shows, reflecting his longtime love of comedy and his own participation in various improv groups over the years. Recently, he even filmed a show for a television pilot at the invitation of a cable network. "They told me 'we're looking for a Charlie Rose for younger demographics,'" says Thorn. "So the format of the pilot is a cross between Charlie Rose and the Howard Stern TV show."</p>
<p>Despite coming of age in a rapidly changing media climate, Thorn is confident there's a place for him in the broadcasting world of the future--whatever form it takes.</p>
<p>"Who knows what medium will be popular in 10 years," says Thorn. "What I do know is that in a world with lots of choices, I have to do something that people will care about. So I have to care. I have values that are reflected in my show--intelligence and fun--and that's what people like about it. In new media, it's important to mean something."</p>
<p>"The people I have on my show enjoy talking with someone who is really interested in their work," he adds. "Unfortunately, authors are used to being interviewed by people who didn't actually read the book. Comedians are used to doing interviews with idiots. And musicians are used to talking to people who were assigned to cover them, or by overly intense fans.</p>
<p>"From the beginning, just the fact that we actually cared about our subject matter put us head and shoulders above most other people in radio doing interviews."</p>

<p>But this Earth Day, you could get a chance. The frog, which lives in the cloud forests of Nicaragua, is one of the creatures featured in "Endangered," Santa Cruz wildlife photographers Kennan and Karen Ward's 4th annual Earth Day presentation. The show is at 7 p.m. April 19 at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Proceeds benefit the UCSC Recreation Department Scholarship Fund and the Conservation Alliance.</p>
<p>The evening's program consists of a film, still photographs, and a talk, said <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/alumni_friends/profiles/#ward">Kennan Ward</a>, who earned a B.A. in environmental studies and wildlife biology from UCSC in 1980. The show covers rare species from seven continents, and ends with one of Ward's most beloved subjects: bears. Polar bears, to be more specific.</p>
<p>But the evening isn't meant to be a downer about the state of the environment, said Ward. If anything, in showing places on Earth that are changing radically, he aims for the opposite.</p>
<p>"I'm not a doom-and-gloom type," Ward said. "I want to encourage people and show the beauty and things that are out there, and let people judge for themselves. This is about embracing and enjoying the Earth. Not that we don't have responsibilities, but everyone will take something different out of this."</p>
<p>There's even some local footage in the show, with a segment on condors along the Big Sur coast.</p>
<p>"It's great for kids. It's a family show," said Ward. "It's for everyone to appreciate and go to and get a good feeling about. No guilt trips."</p>
<p>When asked how long it took to make the film, Ward said, "My lifetime."</p>
<p>"There are photos in there from 1977 'til now," he said.</p>
<p>Advance tickets are $14-$16. On the day of the show, all tickets are $2 more. The Recreation Department will host a special artists reception with wine and crepes after the show at the Crepe Place for Gold Circle ticket holders; the cost for the reception is $50 per person.</p>

Photo by Libby Gilbert-Hovarth.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A recent study indicates that wild salmon may account for just 10 percent of California's fall-run chinook salmon population, while the vast majority of the fish come from hatcheries. The findings are especially troubling in light of the disastrous decline in the population this year, which will probably force the closure of the 2008 season for commercial and recreational salmon fishing.</p>
<p>The role of hatcheries in the management of salmon populations has been a contentious issue for many years. The new findings appear to support the idea that including artificially propagated fish in population estimates can mask declines in natural populations caused by a lack of suitable habitat.</p>
<p>"Our finding that 90 percent of the fish are from hatcheries surprised a lot of people," said Rachel Barnett-Johnson, a fisheries biologist with the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Barnett-Johnson and her coworkers published their results in the December 2007 issue of the <em>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</em>. The main focus of the paper is the development of a new technique for distinguishing between wild and hatchery-raised salmon. The researchers validated the technique and used it to estimate the percentage of wild fish among the fall-run chinook salmon caught by commercial fishing boats along the central California coast in 2002.</p>
<p>"It's a one-time estimate for that year, and these things do change over time. But it's the most recent and perhaps best estimate we have," said Churchill Grimes, director of the National Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory and a coauthor of the paper.</p>
<p>In 2002, the fall run of chinook salmon in the Sacramento River was estimated at 775,000 adults returning to spawn, according to the Pacific Fisheries Management Council. Fewer than 60,000 are expected this year, even with no ocean fishing allowed. If the percentage of wild fish is the same this year as in 2002, it would mean fewer than 6,000 wild salmon in what has been the largest salmon run on the West Coast.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to distinguish between wild and hatchery-raised fish by analyzing the banding patterns in fish ear bones, called otoliths. Like tree rings, characteristic light and dark bands in the otoliths reflect daily growth increments, and the width of the bands indicates growth rates. The differences observed between otoliths from wild and hatchery-raised fish are the result of differences in the availability of food at a critical transition in the salmon life cycle, when the young fish (called fry) have used up the food supply in their yolk sacs and must start feeding themselves, Barnett-Johnson said.</p>
<p>"In the wild, they hide in the gravel until they use up the yolk sac, and then there is a period of slower growth while they learn to feed on aquatic insects. This abrupt transition and slow growth are captured in the growth bands of the otolith," Barnett-Johnson said. "In the hatchery, there is an abundant supply of food, so the transition is smoother and growth bands are wider."</p>
<p>Every fish, therefore, carries an identifier of its origin as a natural tag in the earbone, which has significant advantages over techniques for tagging fish, she said. Coded wire tags (CWTs), for example, have been used to mark fish for some studies. But only a small fraction of hatchery fish and even fewer wild fish are tagged or marked in California, according to Barnett-Johnson. Some small hatchery operations clip the fins of all hatchery fish so they can be distinguished from wild fish, but fall-run chinook salmon are not marked that way. As a result, there have not been good estimates of the proportion of wild fish in the population until this study, she said.</p>
<p>"The only other estimates out there pointed in the other direction--significantly more wild fish than hatchery fish," Barnett-Johnson said. "One study used CWT recoveries from hatchery fish and estimated that 33 percent of adults returning to rivers in the Central Valley were from hatcheries. The other number floating around comes from counting the number of fish returning to spawn in rivers versus returning to hatcheries, and this estimated the number of 'wild' fish to be 3.5 times higher than hatchery returns."</p>
<p>One reason these figures are so important is that they could affect the listing of the fall run under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The question of whether hatcheries can help restore threatened and endangered salmon populations or if they actually harm wild populations has long been a controversial issue. It became a legal issue in 2001, when a federal judge revoked the ESA listing of Oregon coast coho salmon, ruling that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should have included hatchery fish in the population counts.</p>
<p>A more recent federal court ruling, however, concluded that the health and viability of natural populations should be used as the benchmark for ESA status determinations. That ruling has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>
<p>"The agency's policy on counting hatchery fish has flip-flopped as a result of these different legal decisions," Grimes said. "Now the focus is again on wild fish, and it doesn't appear there are many of them. That could be bad news for fishing because, if the fall run is listed under the Endangered Species Act, there would be no legal harvest."</p>
<p>Fisheries experts blame unfavorable ocean conditions for the dismally low returns of chinook and coho salmon to rivers and streams all along the West Coast this year. In 2005, when this year's returning salmon were juveniles just entering the ocean, food production in the California Current was much lower than usual due to a delay in the wind-driven upwelling of nutrient-rich water that sustains the food web along the coast. A similar disruption of the normal upwelling occurred the following year (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=971">earlier press release</a>).</p>
<p>"We expect the returns to be as bad or worse next year as they were this year," Grimes said. "The years when those fish outmigrated into the ocean were the worst conditions that we've seen in over 25 years of observing spring conditions."</p>
<p>Compounding the situation is the degradation of the freshwater habitat for salmon in the Sacramento River and the rest of the Central Valley drainage system, he said. "There is no question that the river basin's capacity to produce salmon--the quality of the habitat--has been degraded something awful, and it just doesn't produce like it used to," Grimes said. "We have these remnant populations--that's all it is really. We're trying to manage what's left."</p>
<p>Barnett-Johnson said the otolith technique offers a new tool for monitoring the effectiveness of restoration efforts and tracking the numbers of wild fish over time. By estimating the numbers of hatchery and wild fish independently, the technique can help to differentiate between effects on the population due to ocean conditions and those due to freshwater conditions. That's because hatchery-raised fish don't face the same hazards in the initial freshwater phase of their life cycle that wild fish do, so they would be affected less by freshwater conditions. Not only are hatchery fish protected and artificially fed in the hatcheries, they also get a free ride downstream in tanker trucks. The hazards associated with migrating downstream to the ocean range from predators to the pumps that siphon water out of the rivers for human use.</p>
<p>"Most of the hatcheries in the Central Valley put the fish in tanker trucks and release them into the lower San Francisco Bay Delta, so they bypass a lot of the mortality that occurs in the rivers," Barnett-Johnson said. "If freshwater mortality was a key factor in population declines, we would expect to see hatchery and wild populations responding differently."</p>
<p>Barnett-Johnson plans to use the otolith technique to track changes in the composition of the salmon population over time. Unfortunately, because her research depends on a collaboration with commercial fishermen, the possible closure of the fishery this year may mean that she will not be able to get any salmon otoliths to analyze.</p>
<p>"At a time when we really need more information on the status of wild populations, a complete closure would mean I can't conduct my research to provide this estimate," she said.</p>
<p>In addition to Barnett-Johnson and Grimes, the coauthors of the paper are Chantell Royer of Humboldt State University and Christopher Donohoe of the NMFS Santa Cruz Laboratory. This research was supported by the UC Marine Council and the Parnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO).</p>

The astronomy and astrophysics professor, who joined the campus in 1972, will be formally inaugurated as UCSC's 10th chancellor on Friday, June 6, 2008.</p>
<p>Blumenthal, 62, is a tall, easy-going man with a quick sense of humor. His many leadership positions at UC Santa Cruz and within the UC system include chair of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, chair of the UCSC Academic Senate, chair of the system-wide Academic Council, and two years as faculty representative on the UC Board of Regents.</p>
<p>In this recent conversation, Blumenthal looks to the future and reflects on UCSC's past and its evolution as a nationally ranked university.</p>
<p><strong>On becoming chancellor</strong></p>

<p>It offers the opportunity to apply all my experiences and insights, and my commitment to providing leadership and making a difference. UC Santa Cruz is truly a special place, and I love it dearly. It's been on an upward trajectory for more than a decade and I'm determined to keep it moving upward. I am fortunate to become chancellor at a pivotal moment for UCSC. This is a campus on the move.</p>
<p><strong>On UCSC's distinctiveness</strong></p>
<p>On this exciting campus, outstanding teaching and research take place at one of the most beautiful locations in the world. When I joined UCSC 35 years ago, I found a place where I could reach out to faculty from other disciplines and learn from them. I discovered the intellectual stimulation that continues to thrive here. Our faculty are inquisitive and willing to put aside assumptions or paradigms and think big thoughts; students are interested not just in learning but in learning how to think.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate priorities</strong></p>
<p>Continuing to elevate UCSC is my first priority. UCSC is among the nation's top-tier universities, both for innovative and effective teaching and for research that serves society. We've established a national reputation in many fields. I want to build additional strength in fields that are important to the future of our students, the state and our nation. My goal as we approach the campus's 50th anniversary in just seven years is to ensure that UCSC further enhances its reputation as a top-ranked research university and a leading institution for educating students.</p>
<p>Every decision I make is designed to help UCSC move forward. I want to increase private support, to invest all our resources strategically in those areas where we can make an enormous difference.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the quality of the university depends on the quality of the faculty. The best students come to study with the best faculty. The best faculty drive new ideas, tackle the most difficult problems. That's why it is important that we--that the university as a whole--continue a program to raise faculty salaries to competitive levels. Child care remains a high priority for faculty and staff. I want UCSC to continue to be a family-friendly campus.</p>
<p>I am committed to increasing diversity in all its forms among students, staff and faculty. I am also personally committed to making UCSC an environmentally sustainable campus.</p>
<p><strong>Education and research</strong></p>
<p>Success and commitment to education is in our DNA. More and more undergraduate students want to come here. That's a measure of the quality of our undergraduate program and I am proud that students recognize it. Our faculty are committed to education. You can see it in the kind of individual attention they give to students, and in the ability of undergraduates to become involved in research. I want our undergraduate experience to be unsurpassed.</p>
<p>Research always has been a component of our mission as a UC campus. A number of years ago, when I was chair of the Academic Senate, the senate and chancellor set a goal of increasing graduate enrollment, which I strongly support. We've doubled the number of graduate offerings in the last 10 years. Nine percent graduate students is just too small to be consistent with the quality of research and the quality of undergraduate education we want to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>Transition from academic leader to chancellor</strong></p>
<p>When you're active in the Academic Senate and take on a leadership role, the senate--the faculty--probably has a more diverse set of views than any group you can imagine. It's a great training ground for learning how to listen to different views, and to reach consensus on moving forward in a positive, constructive way. It's also a great experience for learning about all aspects of the university.</p>
<p>When I was acting chancellor, I spent more than a year talking to people all across campus and going to every event I could. I spoke with students and their parents around the state, and with alumni, legislators, and business leaders. As permanent chancellor, I find that the demands on my time continue to grow. Though I may not be able to attend every meeting or event now, I value the insights that I've gained.</p>
<p><strong>Hardest part about being chancellor</strong></p>
<p>Wearing a tie and not being able to wear shorts; that's number one! Number two is both hard and somewhat interesting: having to shift gears completely five or six times a day. Going from a meeting on a personnel matter, to meeting with political leaders, to giving a speech, to meeting with a donor, to meeting with students, to a conference call on tough budget issues. Constantly changing gears with no transition in between is almost as hard as having to wear a tie.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges ahead</strong></p>
<p>This spring, we'll see the largest graduating high school class in California history. The state's mandate is to provide space for all qualified students to attend the University of California; they are our future. I take seriously our obligation to have the classrooms, labs, facilities, and faculty to provide those students with the quality education they will need to contribute to society. Balancing these demands is difficult, however, especially in tough budget years.</p>
<p>Also, the university's need to serve the growing student population affects the local community, both positively and negatively. I've focused a lot of time and effort on these impacts, and my hope is that we will find ways to reach a resolution that everyone can sign off on.</p>
<p><strong>On Silicon Valley</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is the UC closest to Silicon Valley, the world's center of innovation. We have a significant presence there: We offer graduate and executive training programs, as well as oversee a multimillion-dollar research center. We are also planning for a new school of management that will focus on globalization and technology.</p>
<p>We have public parnerships with NASA and DeAnza/Foothill Community Colleges, and we also have private partners, such as Hewlett Packard.</p>
<p>Many of UCSC's strengths grow from our physical location--our preeminence in marine and ocean sciences and environmental studies, for example. We see a great potential for more research and teaching directly related to issues of Silicon Valley.</p>

You don't.</p>
<p>Just ask Virginia Steel. Over spring break, the University Librarian oversaw the move of materials from the original McHenry Library into the library's recently opened new addition.</p>
<p>The transfer, which was performed by a company in Chicago that specializes in library moves, was in preparation for the renovation and seismic retrofit of the old building. That will take 18-24 months, during which time the original library will be closed.</p>
<p>"It was not a spring 'break,'" said Steel, wearily, though with an excited smile. Despite a huge number of materials and some unwieldy items, the move to the addition went remarkably smoothly, she said, while walking through the modern, concrete-and-glass structure on a recent weekday afternoon. An overcast sky sent white light filtering in through enormous, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a swath of mist-enshrouded redwood trees seemed to envelope the building. Students and others quietly studied or sat at computers.</p>
<p>"It looks like a modern library," said Steel, who looked the part of a modern librarian in a lime-green turtleneck and matching earrings. "Our old library felt more closed in and not as inviting, I think."</p>
<p>But, she added, feedback on the addition has been both positive and negative, with some patrons saying it's too industrial for their taste.</p>
<p>The overall cost of the project is $99 million, with the state providing $86 million, according to Steel. Roughly 40 percent of the cost of the renovation phase is for seismic and life-safety improvements in the old building.</p>
<p><strong>Spring forward</strong></p>
<p>The moving company brought 35 employees and hired about 25 students to perform the transfer of 700,000 volumes, 11,000 videotapes, 5,000 DVDs, 16,000 CDs, 1,100 laser discs, and 71 microforms cabinets.</p>
<p>The movers did get that 800-pound compact shelving unit, which houses CDs and DVDs, into the new space. But they had to use a different entryway with its door removed from the hinges.</p>
<p>Oversized materials in Special Collections also proved awkward to move, said Steel. The photographs, maps, art prints and the like had to be individually walked around the outside of the building with several movers carrying each of the 65 enormous, flat drawers they're stored in.</p>
<p>Though some finishing touches are still in progress, the library is now open, and access to the new addition is available through a temporary entrance on the southwest side of the addition (the Performing Arts side).</p>
<p>The expansion of the library has been a dozen years in the planning. When it's complete, it will create "a contemporary, 21st century library where we'll have the kinds of spaces students expect and need," said Steel. "We want to make this more of a destination spot, both for students and for faculty."</p>
<p>But before it can do all that, the library has to squeeze into the new, approximately 81,600 square feet of space in the addition, since the existing, 114,000-square-foot library, built 42 years ago, will be gutted down to its exterior walls, said Steel.</p>
<p>Library staff downsized the collections in the years before the move, put some items in storage, and sent materials and staff temporarily to the Science &amp; Engineering Library so that everything could fit in the addition while the original McHenry Library is renovated.</p>
<p>To help conserve space, half of the shelving in the addition is on tracks. The shelves, called compact shelving, can therefore sit right up against each other. Using a hand crank, library patrons can roll a shelf unit to one side to create a temporary aisle space.</p>
<p><strong>Library of today</strong></p>
<p>The end panels of the shelving, as well as other elements in the library, are made of kirei--a "green" building material that consists of compressed sugar cane or sorghum.</p>
<p>Standing near the library's 1960s-era furniture--new furnishings will be purchased later, but for now chairs and tables are, well, retro-chic--Steel gestures to the terraced lawn between the addition and the original library.</p>
<p>The lawn has wireless connectivity, and its curved terrace walls have electrical outlets, so people can plug in and enjoy the sunshine.</p>
<p>When finished, the library will offer features including:</p>

<ul>
<li>An electronic research center with 60 stations to access library resources.&#8232;&#8232;<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A visual resource center, providing access to electronic graphic files and image banks, 35 mm slides, and historic collections in various photographic formats.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>An instructional design center to help faculty make innovative use of technology in instruction and research.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A "cyber study" room and cafÃ©--an Internet cafÃ© providing social gathering space and online access.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Distance-learning facilities, providing support for students and faculty at remote locations, such as Silicon Valley.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>A film and music center, providing access to a wide range of nonprint media, including video and audio recordings, CD-ROMs, and DVDs.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Expanded, up-to-date facilities for Special Collections.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Wireless networking throughout the building.<br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Additional electronic workstations and a number of group study rooms to foster collaborative learning.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>The old building, when renovated, will include Special Collections, circulation and reference, library administration, processing, and faculty offices.</p>
<p>The addition will include the media center, visual resources, and some general collections.</p>

Their new findings on ribosomes, the protein-making molecular machines in all cells, are featured on the cover of the April 3, 2008, issue of the international science journal <i>Nature</i>.</p>
<p>The researchers used a laser apparatus called "optical tweezers" to probe the physical steps of the ribosome machine as it translates genetic code into a protein molecule.</p>
<p>Noller, the Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at UCSC, has been studying the ribosome for more than 30 years. His latest findings are the result of a six-year collaboration among three groups within the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3). The joint effort involved Noller and postdoctoral researcher Laura Lancaster at UCSC and the UC Berkeley labs of biophysicist Carlos Bustamante and biophysical chemist Ignacio Tinoco, Jr.</p>
<p>"This is a collaboration between the tweezers guys at Berkeley and the ribosome guy at UCSC," Noller said. "We got together to figure out if we could use this approach to measure forces exerted by ribosomes during protein synthesis."</p>
<p>To make a new protein, the genetic instructions are first copied from the DNA sequence of a gene into a messenger RNA molecule. The ribosome then reads the genetic code from the messenger RNA and translates the code into the structure of a protein.</p>
<p>The Noller lab engineered ribosomes containing messenger RNA molecules with strands of DNA attached to both ends to serve as "handles." The DNA strands, in turn, are attached to tiny beads. Both beads are fixed by lasers in the optical-tweezers apparatus, and the lasers at each end exert opposing forces on the translation system.</p>
<p>Using this system, the researchers were able to follow the translation process in individual ribosomes. They found that protein synthesis has a beat: bop, bop, bop, pause; bop, bop, bop, pause; and so on. The three "bops" correspond to the ribosome reading one "codon"--a sequence of three RNA subunits that tell the ribosome to add a specific amino acid to the protein chain.</p>
<p>"The ribosome moves along the message in a series of stop-and-go events--stalling and translocation. Pause, translocate, pause," Noller said.</p>
<p>Noller's research group was the first to solve the complete structure of a ribosome using x-ray crystallography. That was the first step in answering a bigger question: How does the ribosome operate?</p>
<p>"Until now, we were limited to watching a few trillion ribosomes, and they were not synchronized--the details were blurred. Now we can watch one ribosome at a time," he said.</p>
<p>Noller, who directs the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at UCSC, said the next phase in this project involves refining the analysis. "We have not yet directly measured the forces exerted by the ribosome," he said. "Now we have a more sensitive tweezers setup at UC Berkeley, and we have devised a way of grabbing a ribosome with one tweezers and the message with the other. We can feel the ribosome pulling on the message."</p>

"Everyone has a different idea about what good teaching is. Learning to teach is actually learning how to negotiate the contradictions of teaching for oneself."</p><p>Nearly half of all new teachers leave the profession within their first five years in the classroom, noted Olsen. "Clearly, something isn't working, and I think teacher educators need to consider how their students' histories shape the way they become beginning teachers," he said.</p><p>In <i>Teaching What They Learn, Learning What They Live: How Teachers' Personal Histories Shape Their Professional Development</i> (Boulder, CO: Paradigm Publishers, 2008), Olsen, a former high school English teacher, tells the stories of four aspiring teachers to illustrate the ways in which their teacher-credential programs did--and did not--acknowledge their personal histories. He focuses on the often hidden ways that teachers' personal histories shape their professional learning.</p><p>"We shouldn't frame teaching as a series of problems that get solved, because teaching is really a series of tensions that must be constantly negotiated," said Olsen. Among those contradictions are tensions produced by today's prescriptive educational policies, which don't leave many teachers and school districts much room for creativity or even local control, according to Olsen. </p><p>"Given the current restrictive policy climate in many schools, iconoclastic, creative freethinkers may not want to go into teaching, which is pretty scary for the health of our democracy," said Olsen. "Let's make all these contradictions more visible for beginning teachers. With greater awareness of their own identity development as educators, they'll have more clarity, power, and efficacy."</p><p>#####</p><p><b>Editor's Note</b>: Brad Olsen can be reached at (831) 459-4933 or via e-mail at bolsen@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91560eef8072704601a012ff79d22e7e"><name>2086</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sammy the Slug in national spotlight</title><start-date>1207292400000</start-date><display-name>Sammy the Slug in...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2086</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2086</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338590397</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338590397</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Our Sammy the Slug mascot, nationally ranked in a recent ESPN poll</p><p>(<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1933">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=1933</a>), will be showcased on CBS's popular Sunday Morning show this weekend as part of the network's promotion of the Final Four men's basketball championships.

Pettigrew was chosen by a committee of current and emeriti faculty members and students from the Social Sciences Division who evaluated nominations submitted by faculty, staff, and alumni. </p><p>Pettigrew, who retired from teaching in 1994, has studied intergroup relations for more than five decades, spending the past 20 years focusing on race relations in Europe. Since retiring, he has maintained an active research program and traveled around the world while also remaining involved in campus activities.</p><p>Pettigrew came to UCSC in 1979 after teaching at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University. He was a student at Harvard of pioneering social psychologist Gordon Allport, the pioneer of contact theory, which postulates that prejudice is reduced when people of different races interact with each other. Pettigrew is widely credited with demonstrating that racism is not intractable.</p><p>#####</p><p>Editor's Note: The award luncheon is not open to the public.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915619a68072704601a012ffceb675d7"><name>2097</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Science as the Muse for Art: Melissa Gwyn paints 'Molecules That Matter'</title><summary>Assistant professor of art Melissa Gwyn has contributed four paintings to an unusual exhibition, "Molecules That Matter," at Skidmore College's Tang Museum.</summary><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Melissa Gwyn, Molecules That Matter</keywords><description>Assistant professor of art Melissa Gwyn has contributed four paintings to an unusual exhibition, "Molecules That Matter," at Skidmore College's Tang Museum.</description><start-date>1207551600000</start-date><display-name>Science as the Muse...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2097</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2097</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338593113</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338593113</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/04/images/gwyn_at_tang.275.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/04/images/gwyn_at_tang.275.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gwyn_at_tang.275.jpg</name><file-size>55000</file-size><width>275</width><height>345</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Melissa Gwyn presents her work to students and faculty at the Tang Museum exhibition.

<p>"Molecules That Matter" features giant models of these elite compounds--ranging from aspirin and penicillin to DDT and Prozac--juxtaposed with contemporary works by nationally recognized artists. UCSC assistant professor of art Melissa Gwyn has contributed four paintings to this unusual exhibition at Skidmore College's Tang Museum.</p>
<p>For the past two decades, Gwyn has been creating art inspired by science. Her paintings combine the thick paint of abstract expressionism with the delicate and intricate detail of Dutch 17th-century still life.</p>
<p>Gwyn's oil-encrusted works can take months and even years to dry. She begins each one by pouring puddles of paint onto wood panels and molding the paint with her fingers, scalpels, and tweezers. Eventually, in a labor-intensive process that calls for multiple layers of paint, organic shapes resembling flowers, fruit, and leaves begin to appear and multiply. <em>Artforum</em> magazine noted that her paintings "look like enlarged slides of microscopic organisms whose apparent simplicity is belied, under closer scrutiny, by their teeming busyness."</p>
<p>The co-curators of the "Molecules That Matter" exhibit--the Tang museum's director and a Skidmore chemistry professor--took note of Gwyn's early work dealing with chemistry and selected her 1992 drawing of the hormone progesterone for the show. In addition to including that piece in the exhibition, they invited her to create new works to represent three other featured molecules: DDT, Prozac, and the recently discovered carbon structure, Buckminsterfullerine.</p>
<p>"In my paintings, I draw inspiration from scientific imaging and science illustration sources," says Gwyn. "The paintings also reflect my research into each molecule's impact--both positive and negative--while incorporating my ongoing interest in the environment and its degradation."</p>
<p>Gwyn's creative approach generated paintings that blend depictions of MRI scans and digital modeling of human anatomy with traditional still-life forms. "The DDT painting, for example, combines repetitive patterns of red blood cells, parasites in those cells, and images of the Colorado potato beetle, because the pesticide DDT became the focus of a campaign to eradicate the beetle," says Gwyn.</p>
<p>Her Prozac painting focuses on a lesser known environmental impact of the pill's popularity.</p>

<p>"In researching Prozac, I came upon a study that found there is so much Prozac in the culture that it's ending up in wastewater, with the result that it may be affecting fish and frog populations and altering their reproductive cycles. So I created a surrealistic, fantastic pond-like site where frogs--an indicator species--are swimming among algae and seaweed that resemble human neurons and nephrons (the kidney filtration system)--as their realities and ours are intertwined."</p>
<p>Most of the pieces in the "Molecules That Matter" exhibition were culled from existing art; in fact, Gwyn is the only artist from whom the curators sought new work.</p>
<p>She devoted seven months to the three new paintings, completing them this past August. Gwyn attended the exhibit opening a month later and spent time meeting with Skidmore College students in organic chemistry, art theory, and painting classes. She also participated in public panels along with the curators, scientists, a historian, and another artist to discuss the art/science collaboration.</p>
<p>Gwyn's fascination with art and science was originally inspired by elementary school science books and the children's science fairs that she encountered in the public school systems of New York, where she worked part time in the early 1990s after graduating from Yale with an M.F.A. in painting.</p>
<p>"I was quite taken with the way that children's creativity interpreted the symbols of atoms in molecular models," notes Gwyn. "Kids created brilliant models of graphite with gumdrops and toothpicks; another molecule was represented by aggregates of colored gym socks. Inspired by these sculptures, I began to build molecular models out of plastic fruit and then depicted the models in still-life paintings."</p>
<p>Gwyn's participation in "Molecules That Matter" has already sparked new interest in her art; her work has been noted in several reviews of the exhibit, including one featured in the December issue of the magazine <em>Chemistry World.</em></p>
<p>"The great benefit of artists working with scientists is finding shared vocabulary and experiences," observes Gwyn. "When people in different disciplines reveal their ideas, processes, and failures, it brings more dimensionality to a subject."</p>
<p>"The Tang exhibit is a perfect example of this," she adds. "The functionality of having these seemingly invisible molecules exhibited at a scale even larger than the viewers themselves is a fascinating reversal of focus. It brings to light the huge impact that these molecules have on our lives."</p>
<p><em>The "Molecules That Matter" exhibit runs through April 13 at the Tang Museum, before traveling to several other college campuses across the country.</em></p>

<p>Indeed, consumers appear almost giddy as they reach for their wallets, paying roughly 1,000 times as much for bottled water as they would pay for the same amount of tap water-despite widespread reports that many leading brands are little more than treated municipal tap water.</p>
<p>And it's not just water and organic veggies that shoppers are snapping up: Judging by the popularity of "natural" personal hygiene products, "nontoxic" household cleaning products, and "green" building materials, a growing number of consumers believe they can buy some protection and some peace of mind.</p>
<p>But can they?</p>
<p>In his new book, <em>Shopping Our Way to Safety: How We Changed from Protecting the Environment to Protecting Ourselves,</em> UCSC sociology professor Andrew Szasz says "buying green" offers little real defense against environmental hazards and may pose an even greater threat by lulling people into a false sense of security.</p>
<p>"It's a peculiar form of environmentalism in which people recognize the problem but have given up on any hope of collective improvement," contends Szasz. "Consumers believe these products will protect them, which creates a kind of political 'anesthesia' that severely reduces their willingness to participate in collective political action to generate real change."</p>
<p>Despite the booming business in products designed to protect consumers from environmental threats, Szasz finds little evidence that these products provide the benefits consumers are counting on. Bottled water is less stringently regulated than tap water, and although people who consistently eat organic foods do have lower levels of pesticide residues in their bodies, they are not residue-free. As for "natural" and "nontoxic" products, including clothing, bedding, and furniture, Szasz points out that such products are poorly regulated, if they are regulated at all. "These products do not work nearly well enough to warrant the faith consumers have placed in them," he says.</p>
<p>Today's individualistic, consumer-based approach to dealing with hazards is a perfect example of a phenomenon Szasz has dubbed "inverted quarantine." Unlike the public health model of quarantine, in which contagions are contained to protect the public, Szasz's model refers to people attempting to insulate themselves from omnipresent threats. In his book, Szasz presents the fallout shelter panic of 1961 as a compelling example of inverted quarantine. That autumn, in the wake of an alarming speech by President Kennedy, Americans briefly embraced the notion that they could survive a nuclear attack by fleeing to a backyard shelter. <em>Life</em> magazine even published a feature about post-attack shelter living, complete with drawings of a smiling mom, pipe-smoking dad, and happy kids enjoying life underground. Exploiting the public's very real fears of nuclear war, building contractors and con artists capitalized on the frenzy until reason finally prevailed--and tensions with Russia eased.</p>
<p>The episode reveals the ultimate limits of individual self-protection, says Szasz.</p>
<p>"Instead of trying to limit contaminants in our environment, the way public health officials do when there's an outbreak of disease, people have given up on the collective good," he says. "They're hiding behind an array of products they hope will protect them. It's a fatalistic, consumer-based approach that is, like the fallout shelters, bound to fail."</p>
<p>But environmental threats are real and likely to intensify, warns Szasz, who nevertheless remains hopeful that public awareness will rouse people from their complacency and rekindle a more vibrant, collective environmental movement.</p>
<p>"Surveys show that Americans care about the environment, water pollution, and air quality, but there's a disconnect," he says. "Instead of engaging in political action, people go shopping and think they've solved the problem. That needs to change."</p>

<p>The former placed him among the top 20 foil fencers in the country, while the latter propelled him to the top of a capital investment firm with more than $10 billion invested in Asia.</p>
<p>"Through a real accident of history, I ended up in the asset management industry, which I didn't even know existed," said Headley, who grew up in Berkeley and arrived at UCSC as "a young radical kid--cynical, confused and angry. It's been a long road to where I am now."</p>
<p>These days, Headley speaks regularly with UCSC's legendary fencing coach Charles Selberg, but he spends most of his time managing investments for Matthews International Capital Management, the largest capital investment firm specializing in public companies in the Asian Pacific region.</p>
<p>"I have a tremendous ringside seat watching the rubber hit the road," said Headley, who calls the privatization of the Chinese economy "the greatest story of the past 20 years." The transformation of China, and other nations, has been fueled in part by firms like Matthews, which manage mutual funds that invest in Asian companies.</p>
<p>Headley attributes much of his success to the education he received at UCSC. As a student, he chose a double major in politics and economics because it allowed him to "cherry pick" upper division classes and gain in-depth knowledge of Asia and development theory. "It was my own version of a developing world political-economy degree," he recalled. Sociology professor Paul Lubeck was influential, and economics professor Alan Richards "had a huge impact because he'd 'de-Marxed' me. He showed me the dysfunctions of Marxist economics."</p>
<p>Indeed, well-regulated public markets are emerging across Asia, a region where feudal hierarchies and government interference have historically shaped the financial landscape.</p>
<p>"I'm a huge believer in transparency and the transformative power of public financial systems," said Headley. "The notion of public equities--stocks traded on markets that people around the world can buy--Â­stands in stark contrast to organizations controlled by individuals or governments.</p>
<p>By contrast, how much does anybody know about private companies like Bechtel? Nothing, because they're not beholden to public-sector laws and all of the disclosure that comes with that."</p>
<p>Headley reconnected with UCSC a few years ago, after attending a lecture in San Francisco by Paul Lubeck about global politics in the wake of September 11.</p>
<p>Last spring, he returned to campus to deliver a rapid-fire lecture on "Capitalism, Development and Sustainability in Asia" to a gathering of undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty. Clearly at the top of his game, Headley captivated his audience with stories of his work in China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.</p>
<p>"The trajectory of the banking system defines your ability to grow," Headley told the group. In China today, workers can get a 30-year mortgage, three credit cards, and buy a car on credit. "People need to have the ability to save and borrow money. It really does democratize the system, because it creates a middle-class that's well-established, educated, and more empowered. We aren't seen as colonial invaders, we're seen as helping fuel growth."</p>
<p>At UCSC, Headley is eager to help ensure that another generation of students has access to profound, life-changing educational experiences. He has contributed generously to the Global Information Internship Program (GIIP), an initiative Lubeck launched that sends tech-savvy undergraduates to the far corners of the globe to help resource-starved nonprofits and nongovernmental organizations harness the power of the Internet. He is also chair of the program's Global Advisory Board, as well as a member of the Social Science Division's</p>
<p>advisory council.</p>
<p>Although Headley's education may have helped him land his first job in asset management, his success depends on expertise, passion, and keen instincts. When he became active in Asian investing in 1989, Wall Street had a "hands off" attitude toward the region, but he saw opportunity.</p>
<p>Now Headley looks forward to launching an Asian "green capital fund" that will invest in companies steering Asia toward a better environmental future. Facing huge population pressures and rapid growth, the region needs to take the lead in developing new technologies before it's too late, according to Headley.</p>
<p>"As I learned in Alan Richards's class, until you're middle class, you don't care about air quality. You can't afford to," he said. "I think Asia today is achieving a level of wealth where the environment is coming to the forefront. Asia is ripe for a green revolution."</p>

<p>Next week, the 11-foot tall and 4.5-foot wide oil paintings will be carefully packed into a large wooden crate and shipped by truck to LaCrosse, Wisconsin, where they will be installed in The Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.</p>
<p>"It's by far the biggest job I've ever taken on in painting," says Buchanan. "I'm using traditional oil painting techniques from 17th-century Europe. I've gone through just a ton of paint--I had 14 to 15 colors on the palette."</p>
<p>Because of the sheer size of the paintings, Buchanan rented a room with an extremely tall ceiling on the second floor of the old, historic Holy Cross High School building in Santa Cruz to complete the commissioned project. The canvasses were so large they couldn't fit in the studio--attached to his house in Santa Cruz--where he normally works.</p>
<p>He was recommended for the job by a former professor from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where Buchanan studied classical painting and drawing for two years before enrolling at UC Santa Cruz and earning a B.A. in art. He went on to receive an M.F.A. in painting from the New York Academy of Art in 2002.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Buchanan studied with professor of art Frank Galuszka, who coincidentally had also just moved to Santa Cruz from Philadelphia to join the UCSC faculty. "We had a great relationship; we really connected as teacher and student," said Buchanan.</p>
<p>That relationship proved to be quite helpful for this particular project. Buchanan said that Galuszka, former chair of the UCSC Art Department, dropped by the studio on a weekly basis to offer suggestions and advice about the paintings.</p>
<p>Buchanan said he has been working toward the goal of mastering painting techniques of the Renaissance and 17th-century Europe since he first began art school in 1994. For the past six years, he has also taught classes in painting and drawing at UCSC, Cabrillo College, and the College of San Mateo.</p>
<p>"I think most people aren't aware of all the planning that goes into works like these," Buchanan noted. "There's just months of doing studies and drawings of all the elements. You're looking at other paintings and focusing on mundane details--such as if there's a brick floor in the painting, you need to look at a brick floor and rehearse exactly how it will look."</p>
<p>Despite a great deal of anxiety and several false starts due to errors of anatomy and proportion, Buchanan said he is quite happy with how the two paintings turned out.</p>
<p>"It was an emotional rollercoaster," he reflected. "I would liken the whole experience to some kind of sea voyage. You leave the port in really good form, but soon hit a huge squall and lose some people and equipment. After you refigure your goals and plans, you finally return to your initial port of origin and you're amazed--you can't believe you made it. And the ship is in entirely different shape. That's the closest thing to how it feels."</p>

"I don't listen to Top 40, obviously. But anything that has a live host somewhere, I'm cool."</p><p>As a first-year master's student in the Social Documentation program, O'Higgins is focusing on audio production. One of her documentaries was recently picked up by National Public Radio, which showcases new talent on its podcast site.</p><p>O'Higgins caught the radio bug as an undergraduate at Antioch College in Ohio, where she was an intern for the local NPR station. "I fell absolutely in love," she recalled. She stayed on at the station for nine months after graduation, then spent four months at the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in Portland, Maine, where she became interested in radio as a vehicle for social change.</p><p>"I see radio as a way to bridge the gap between academia and activism," she said. In the Social Documentation program, O'Higgins has found a way "to take the ideas and concepts discussed in the academy and make art out of it." (To hear some of her work, visit <a href="http://www.prx.org/">The Public Radio Exchange</a>; registration is required.)</p><p>Picked up by NPR, her documentary entitled "We Are the Canaries" explores the experiences of four women diagnosed with chronic fatigue immune-dysfunction syndrome. Her master's project will also focus on chronic illness. O'Higgins, who suffers from lupus, says illuminating the nonmedical aspects of illness can shed light on social norms and expectations, and the way society devalues the ill.</p><p>"Since I was young, lupus was always very medical, but there was always something else different about me because I was sick," she said. "Illness and disability is a way to look at gender roles, productivity, cultural norms. Illness has been medicalized. If you live long enough, everyone has a disability."</p><p>As a vehicle for information, radio is an inherently empowering medium, she noted. "Ultimately, for me, the goal of a radio piece is to have listeners experience a moment when they see themselves and realize they could think about things differently," she said, expressing a desire to produce "little stories that illustrate wider social problems."</p><p>The master's program in Social Documentation offers students a "theoretical grounding" in social science research and training in audio, video, film, photography, and new media to produce work that will contribute to social change. O'Higgins says radio is her way to contribute to a better world. "I was never on the bus to D.C.," she says, referring to political protests. Rather, she says, "Social change is incremental through cultural production."</p><p>Captivated by the work of radio visionaries like <i>This American Life</i> creator Ira Glass, O'Higgins began producing radio documentaries, including a recent piece about an old-time, midway-style animal freak show in Venice Beach and a profile that aired on Maine Public Radio of a loner whose consolations in life--collecting Fiestaware and listening to Barbra Steisand records--strike an emotional chord with listeners. </p><p>Lately, as a substitute host for KUSP Radio, the NPR affiliate in Santa Cruz, O'Higgins has found herself drawn to the role of on-air host, as well. </p><p>"You know how people say, when they hear a recording of their voice, 'I don't sound like that, do I?' Well, that happened to me, too. The first time I was invited to do a voiceover promotional piece, I think I probably recorded it 500,000 times," she said. "Then I got over it and was hooked." </p><p>O'Higgins is heartened by the growth of public radio in recent years, and although her twin sister isn't yet a fan, Briana looks forward to a career in broadcasting. "I loved the Midwest," she said, hinting at her likely destination after graduation. "I love Chicago Public Radio."</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915626358072704601a012ff08fb249a"><name>2105</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ecological landscaping workshop April 17</title><summary>Join three graduates of UCSC's Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture on April 17 for a free public workshop on ecological landscaping.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>landscaping, workshop, ecological, apprenticeship, agroecology</keywords><description>Join three graduates of UCSC's Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture on April 17 for a free public workshop on ecological landscaping.</description><start-date>1207810800000</start-date><display-name>Ecological landscaping workshop April...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2105</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2105</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338596347</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338596347</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Join three graduates of UCSC's Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture on April 17 for a free public workshop on ecological landscaping.</p>

Phase II implementation is scheduled to begin May 15, 2008. This roll out will include Non-Recruitment and Waiver of Recruitment processing capabilities as well as general system modifications. Use of Phase II functionality will be implemented in three stages outlined below:</p><p>* May 15: General system modifications.</p><p>* June 2-22: Non-Recruitment/Waiver of Recruitment Pilot Program.</p><p>* June 23: Remaining campus units will begin using RMS to process Non-Recruitment and Waiver of Recruitment actions.</p><p>A series of one hour briefings is scheduled for May 2-12. These briefings will provide an overview of the general system modifications coming on-line May 15. Attendance is voluntary, but strongly encouraged for individuals who routinely use the system to facilitate Open and Campus-Only recruitments. Space is limited, so enroll early by calling the Staff HR Employment Office at 459-2009. Information will be repeated in each offering, so attendance at one briefing is sufficient.</p><p>Non-recruitment/Waiver of Recruitment Pilot Program participants will receive additional information in the coming weeks. Briefing schedule and project updates are available at, <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/rms-phase-ii/">http://shr.ucsc.edu/announce/rms-phase-ii/</a>.

Kenneth Pedrotti, associate professor of electrical engineering, was a coauthor of the paper, which was presented at the 2008 International Conference on VLSI Design in January in Hyderabad, India. </p><p>The paper describes the development of an electronic receiver for use in a low-cost optical communication system. The research is part of an effort in Pedrotti's lab, supported in part by National Semiconductor, to investigate low-cost approaches to achieve high-speed data transport over short distances. Currently, optical data transmission (using fiber optics) is used primarily for long-distance communication, such as the telephone network and Internet backbone. Pedrotti's research is aimed at lowering the cost of the components of optical systems so that they can be used in other applications in place of copper cables.</p><p>The first author of the paper, Saurav Bandyopadhyay, is a student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur. He began the project in 2006 when he came to UCSC to study in Pedrotti's research group. Coauthor Pradip Mandal, an engineering professor at IIT Kharagpur, has also visited UCSC over the past two years as part of the exchange program. Stephen Ralph of the Georgia Institute of Technology is also a coauthor.</p><p>"We have been developing relationships with top universities overseas, and for the past several years have sponsored students and professors from IIT Kharagpur to come and study in our group," Pedrotti said. "The program helps us attract top students from around the world."</p><p>Bijoy Chatterjee, director of virtual laboratories at National Semiconductor, was instrumental in making connections between UCSC and research groups at IIT Kharagpur. Chatterjee has been a strong supporter of the Baskin School of Engineering and serves on the advisory board for the Department of Computer Engineering. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915634678072704601a012ff179a4c87"><name>2113</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>University Cafe aims to spark 'conversations that matter'</title><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>World Cafe, University Cafe</keywords><start-date>1207897200000</start-date><display-name>University Cafe aims to...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2113</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2113</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338599975</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1301414437125</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/04/images/university.cafe.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/04/images/university.cafe.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>university.cafe.300.jpg</name><file-size>16885</file-size><width>300</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>University Cafe planning group member Dave Shaw speaks with cafe participants before the conversations start.

<p>Thursday afternoon, about 20 members of the campus community came together in the College 9/10 Multipurpose Room for University Cafe, a conversational process meant to bring various perspectives to the table, provoke thought, and create action in pursuit of common aims.</p>
<p>The idea is based on <a href="http://www.theworldcafe.com/">World Cafe</a>, a methodology for hosting conversations about important questions. The World Cafe was born in 1995 during a two-day dialogue among a global, interdisciplinary group known as the Intellectual Capital Pioneers. Since then, it's been used by hundreds of groups, including large multinational corporations, small nonprofits, government offices, community-based organizations, and educational institutions.</p>
<p>World Cafe meetings had been happening at Kresge College since the fall, according to Mike Yamauchi-Gleason, college administrative officer for Porter and Kresge colleges. To signify that the gatherings are meant to be university-wide conversations, organizers decided to name the events University Caf&#233;.</p>
<p>"We hope we can bring faculty, students, and staff together for intimate conversations," said Yamauchi-Gleason.</p>
<p>Thursday's meeting was the second such gathering in 2008. Organizers offered tea and cookies, and set up tables covered in jaunty gingham tablecloths, drawing paper, and pens. Participants included faculty, students, and leadership from Student Affairs and the Chancellor and Executive Vice Chancellor offices.</p>
<p>"What might be the value of conversations about things that matter among faculty, students, staff, and administrators on a regular basis?" asked Laurie McCann, campus ombuds, in one question designed to spark conversation among the groups of people at tables.</p>
<p>Respondents talked about the cafe being a way to bring new insights across campus, inspire communication, and safely argue and disagree.</p>
<p>The discussion then moved to how to make the conversations an ongoing part of campus life. Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger suggested making them part of students' core course; others thought they should be based on popular topics or initiated by students.</p>
<p>While participants talked, graphic recorder Susan Kelly created an impromptu mural recording the participants' comments.</p>

(Photos by Phil Carter)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ethan Edwards already knows he's going to UC Santa Cruz. But he wanted to get a taste of university life here before packing up and leaving his parents' home in Carlsbad in the fall.</p>
<p>So the La Costa Canyon High School senior, 18, and his dad, UCSC alumnus Steve Edwards (class of '78), hit the road. The two headed to UCSC's Spring Spotlight, a two-week event for admitted students for fall 2008 that provides an overview of the academic, residential, and student-life experience at UCSC.</p>
<p>This year's event, which includes walking tours, information sessions, resource fairs, and visits to the residential colleges and classrooms, started April 5 and goes through April 19.</p>
<p>Newly admitted freshmen, many of whom have been accepted to multiple colleges and universities, must make their decision on where they're enrolling by May 1.</p>
<p>For Ethan, the question's already settled--he likes outdoor activities such as hiking and swimming, and UCSC appeals to him in part because of its abundant recreational opportunities.</p>
<p>Others, such as Chelseah Murphy, 17, a senior at El Segundo High School, attended Spring Spotlight to learn more as they weigh their decision.</p>
<p>"She wanted to see what her overall feel was for the campus," said Chelseah's mom, Karen Murphy, while waiting for the next tour with her daughter in the blue-and-gold-balloon-adorned Merrill Cultural Center.</p>
<p>That's exactly what admissions officials want admitted students to do.</p>
<p>"They're trying to see if this is the right place for them, if it meets their needs and wants," said Michael McCawley, acting director of admissions. "And family members want to feel secure in sending their child to UCSC. All are looking for reassurance that UCSC is right for them."</p>
<p>To that end, admissions staff is making sure they're portraying UCSC in an accurate and honest fashion, said McCawley.</p>
<p>"What we don't want is students who aren't going to be happy here," McCawley said. "So we go for a genuine picture of what student and academic life is like at UCSC."</p>
<p>This year, they also revamped and renamed the event, previously called Experience UC Santa Cruz, to make it more meaningful for students and families, he said.</p>
<p>"We worked with the entire campus to make it more inclusive, have more rooms being shown--dorm rooms, apartments, those kinds of things--and worked with faculty to make sure classrooms were available," said McCawley.</p>
<p>By April 10, nearly 6,000 people had made reservations to come to campus, said McCawley. He estimated that up to 9,000 people could ultimately attend the event by its end date.</p>
<p>About a third of UCSC's admitted population comes from the Southern California region, according to McCawley. About another third comes from the Bay Area; the rest are from spots throughout the state.</p>
<p>UCSC hopes to enroll a class of approximately 3,700 new freshmen and 850 transfer students for fall 2008, about the same enrollment as last year.</p>
<p>Spring Spotlight has gone well so far, said Judy Burseth, campus tour manager.</p>
<p>"Students are excited to be here, and our guides are terrific," she said. "It's really been fun."</p>
<p>Reservations are required for Spring Spotlight events. For information, visit the <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/springspotlight08/">Spring Spotlight page</a>.</p>

<p>A star of public radio, Silva (B.A., aesthetic studies, 1973) has produced groundbreaking programming for National Public Radio with her longtime collaborator and fellow UCSC graduate Davia Nelson (B.A., politics, 1975). Over the years, the two women have attracted devoted listeners to several series, including <em>Lost &amp; Found Sound</em> and the <em>Sonic Memorial Project</em>, an audio archive of the World Trade Center. The duo, known as The Kitchen Sisters, are now producing radio documentaries that explore how communities come together around food, so it was perhaps fitting that Silva proposed a potluck for the class's last meeting, and showed up with a colorful tablecloth and a fresh fruit tart.</p>
<p>"I was really excited to meet her," said Damaris Santos Palmer, a first-year graduate student in Social Documentation who hosted a radio program for three years during college but produced her first radio documentary last fall. "It was such an honor."</p>
<p>Throughout the quarter, Silva shepherded her students, whose abilities ranged from novice to quite advanced, providing basics on interviewing and recording, as well as feedback on how to structure a lengthy radio documentary and how to market finished pieces to NPR and other outlets. Spend your money on the microphone, she urged students, and get subjects out from behind their desks when you interview them. "It's a psychological thing," she said with a knowing smile.</p>
<p>Summing up her own approach, Silva said, "I don't ever want to tell anybody what they're supposed to think or feel. I want my story to make my listener think and feel."</p>
<p>Student projects included an evocative portrait of a Vietnam veteran who is counseling Iraq War veterans, a lighthearted piece by Palmer about the struggles parents face getting their toddlers to sleep at night, and a spirited account of survival among women doctoral students. Students will discuss their work on KZSC Radio on Thursday, April 17, at 4 p.m. with Silva and program host Bruce Bratton, who will play excerpts of student work.</p>
<p>Silva taught the five-week workshop course through the Community Studies Department's graduate program in Social Documentation. The opportunity to work with Silva attracted three graduate students in the program's audio emphasis, and Marc Ramos, assistant producer director in the Social Sciences Media Lab, provided technical support to the class.</p>
<p>"If you're going to work in public radio in any capacity, you're going to know The Kitchen Sisters," said first-year graduate student Briana O'Higgins (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2103">profile</a>).</p>
<p>Silva commiserated with students about deadlines, equipment failures, and technological glitches, and she regaled them with stories of her earlier work, including the 1980 piece that finally opened doors for The Kitchen Sisters--a portrait of a one-handed pool player.</p>
<p>Recounting the myriad errors she and Nelson made recording the interview, Silva lamented the fact that they had to rerecord the entire piece but said they were fortunate because "he was one of those rare people who can tell the same story time after time with detail and passion." During the editing, Silva and Nelson kept cutting the narration until they eliminated their own voices entirely, developing their trademark style of nonnarrated storytelling. "That was the piece that really pushed us over the top," said Silva.</p>
<p>The workshop format of the class played to Silva's strengths. A consummate brainstormer, she offered feedback and ideas on each piece as it developed over the course of the five-week class, and students followed her lead, weighing in with their opinions and suggestions.</p>
<p>Often, Silva used analogies about music or food. "It's like music: The verse is so long, the climax is here, and then the denouement. There are rules you can choose to break, but it is how people listen." Or: "You have to distill it, because no one has the ears for it that you do. You have to do it. It's hard. But when you take all the bits and put them together, you've just made espresso."</p>
<p>As students grappled with the ethics of how to portray their subjects and whether to invite their input during the editing process, Silva was empathetic yet firm. "In our work, they're not involved at all," she said of her subjects. "I always feel so obligated, but you have to figure out, am I the storyteller, or are they?"</p>
<p>Another afternoon, during a discussion of how to interview subjects about disturbing events in their lives, she encouraged them to be sensitive yet confident: "So many people need to talk. We're bearing witness. That's a really important contribution we're making."</p>
<p>Silva urged her students to seek audiences for their work. Responding to those who find the prospect of pitching their work daunting, Silva said, "Force yourself. You have to force yourself to just send it off. What can they say? No? The most important thing is to find the person you should be talking to."</p>
<p>And then she promised to get them names.</p>

But my research reveals that Americans--especially women, Latinas, and African Americans--are much more egalitarian than the stereotype suggests," said Viotti, who has developed an experiment to test Americans' willingness to share their wealth. </p><p>By several measures, the gap between rich and poor is becoming a chasm: The ratio of pay between executives and workers was 40:1 in 1980 and is more than 400:1 today, and real income has remained flat or gone down for more than 80 percent of Americans during the same period, according to Viotti. </p><p>Yet all the cross-national studies of inequality conducted over the past 30 years show Americans as a group to have a high tolerance for inequality and to be far less likely than Europeans, for example, to think redistributing wealth is a good thing. "The literature is very clear on this," said politics professor Michael Brown, explaining why Viotti's work is attracting interest in the fields of political science and economics. "What Paul's data shows, contrary to many studies, is that some Americans really are quite egalitarian."</p><p> </p><p>Viotti, curious about how Americans are responding to the widening gap between rich and poor, designed an experiment that asks respondents how they would slice up the proverbial pie--and with actual cash at stake, the experiment forced participants to "put their money where their mouth is." Viotti asked participants how they would distribute $100 among a group of five people, including themselves, if they didn't know in advance who would get what share of the $100. Participants overwhelmingly chose to share the money equally, each forgoing their chance to get the entire $100 and taking home $20 instead.</p><p>Those results conform with what political theorist John Rawls predicted, but Viotti wondered what participants would do if the "veil of ignorance" were removed and decision makers knew what share they would get before they started slicing. While economic theory predicts that people act to maximize their own gains, Viotti found that a surprising 42 percent still opted to distribute the money equally, even when given the chance to claim the whole $100 for themselves. </p><p>"White men proved to be the least egalitarian, while women much more than men--and Latinas in particular--seem to make the most egalitarian choices," said Viotti. In a third scenario designed to measure how much individuals would be willing to give up to preserve group equality, many participants chose to slice a smaller pie equally, rather than have a chance at a bigger pie.</p><p>"This work undermines the dominant idea that people will pursue their self-interest above the well-being of others," said Viotti. "This concern for the welfare of the group, as opposed to the individual, flies in the face of rational behavior as described by many economic theorists."</p><p>Viotti's initial findings, based on experiments, attitudinal surveys, and focus groups with 100 participants at UCSC, were so compelling that the National Science Foundation awarded him a dissertation grant, and he took his study on the road to Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, and, closer to home, Watsonville. Viotti sought as much diversity as he could find, in geography, religion, gender, race, and income.</p><p>"I tell people that doing experimental economics on the road is harder than planning a wedding," said Viotti. "You have to find a location, advertise to find participants; then you need them to show up at a given place and time, and all you can tell them is that they'll be involved in an economic simulation." </p><p>Despite the difficulties, Viotti was able to reach an additional 200 people, and the results held up. Furthermore, the conclusions revealed even more demographic differences: African Americans, like Latinas and women generally, are more egalitarian at a personal cost, he said. "The values people have when they make choices differ according to their cultural groups," said Viotti, adding that documenting such differences, and understanding how they shape attitudes, is critical.</p><p>"I've found that certain groups--Latinos, African Americans, and women--are less averse toward downward redistribution of income and wealth," said Viotti. "They're more supportive of increasing taxes on those with disproportionate income and wealth. Yet the conventional wisdom is that Americans don't want to hear about raising taxes on anybody. As a social scientist, it's critical to document these differences."</p><p>Viotti's results may give policymakers a chance to revisit the issue of income inequality. "Even Alan Greenspan has said the current level of inequality threatens the stability of democratic capitalism," noted Viotti.</p><p>Viotti's work is getting attention in the field of political science, as well; it will be featured during the American Political Science Association's annual meeting in Boston this August. Soon, he and fellow UCSC alumna Alessandra Cassar (Ph.D. international economics, 2001), an assistant professor of economics at the University of San Francisco, have expanded the research to China, India, and Panama, and will soon add Uganda, as well.</p><p>"We really want to look at the question of how culture and other differences between groups affect the choices people make," explained Viotti. "Do the differences we see between men and women in the United States hold true in other countries? How do the attitudes of Hindus in South India compare with those of elites in Beijing?

One of the most influential introductory courses in the field, it has now been captured on DVD through a taping project led by her former students.</p>
<p>The new DVD release will be highlighted-along with works by other feminist faculty at UCSC-at a celebration of feminist scholarship on campus that will take place from 2 to 4 p.m. on April 25 at the Bay Tree Bookstore. The event is part of the Alumni Spring Weekend at UCSC <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/detail_08.html#feminnisms">schedule of events</a>.</p>
<p>Students often describe Aptheker's class as a "life-changing experience" and an "eye-opener." A deeply compelling speaker, she mixes art, poetry, guest speakers, historical essays, slides, videos, and music into a multifacted course that lingers in the minds of undergraduates long after they leave the classroom.</p>
<p>Four years ago, one of those former students, Eric Zamost, teamed up with fellow alum Nicolette Czarrunchick, former manager of the Women's Studies Department, to begin raising money for the project. The goal was to produce a broadcast-quality, multi-camera video of Aptheker's course and to make DVDs available--at cost--to universities and high schools throughout the country.</p>
<p>The topics of the lectures range from racism and violence against women to body image and women's history.</p>
<p>"We particularly want to get the DVDs into the high schools because domestic violence, childhood abuse, and sexual violence are very pervasive in our society," Aptheker noted. "And mostly there is very little analysis at the high school level of why that is, and how girls and women can protect and empower themselves."</p>
<p>"My class deals with the many gender, race, class, and sexuality interests in people's lives," Aptheker added. "There's a lot of theory available, but it's not often presented in an accessible way that high school students-or incoming university students-can understand."</p>
<p>Aptheker began her career at UCSC as the sole lecturer in the Women's Studies Department (now named Feminist Studies). She became the department's first ladder-rank faculty member in 1987 and was honored with the Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001.</p>

In recent years, thousands of people have gathered on the UCSC campus to participate in this event.</p><p>The University does not condone, support or otherwise sanction this event. The increasingly large crowds that have gathered in recent years present safety risks for participants, whether students or people not affiliated with the campus. This activity also violates a number of campus regulations designed to provide for the well-being of our campus and neighboring community.</p><p>In anticipation of this year's April 20 activity, I have authorized the implementation of a number of restrictions for this coming weekend, April 19-20.  This communication is intended to alert the community of the transportation changes, parking restrictions, and other actions that will limit access to campus.</p><p>This advance notification is provided to enable those who have valid reasons for coming to campus this weekend to adjust their schedules and transportation plans accordingly:</p><p>o  The West Entrance to campus will be closed to inbound vehicular traffic on Sunday.</p><p>o  The Main Entrance will be open that day, but campus personnel will restrict vehicular access to people who have UCSC parking permits or who can show evidence they are attending sanctioned campus events that day.</p><p>o  Parking permits will be required in all campus lots throughout the weekend, even in those that typically require no permits on weekends. The parking restriction will include evening hours on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. (If you need to park on campus this weekend and do not currently have a permit, you will need to purchase one by 6 p.m. on Friday.)</p><p>o  At our request Metro bus drivers will not bring riders onto campus on Sunday.

Extra patrols will be on duty to enforce these restrictions.</p><p>o  Drivers and passengers who can't prove that they have a legitimate reason to be on campus on Sunday will be turned away at the main gate.

To that end, I write to you regarding a non-University sanctioned event that has become concerning for our community. Often referred to as "Four-Twenty" or "4/20," this event revolves around the use of marijuana and other illegal drugs. Over the past four years, we have seen this non-sanctioned event grow in numbers from several hundred people to over 5,000 people last year.</p><p>This activity has become a concern to the University administration, to our campus community, parents, prospective students and families, and members of the greater community.  We are particularly concerned about the sheer number of people who may show up to participate in this event. Participants in the past have been UCSC students, some middle school and high school minors, and many non-affiliates with no investment in our community. In light of the large number of unplanned people who may arrive on our campus this weekend, several measures will be implemented to ensure the safety of the greater campus community.  I want to provide all students with a summary of these measures so that you may plan accordingly in advance of the weekend.  I regret the inconvenience these measures may cause.</p><p>o	Campus Access and Kiosk Gate Program:  The campus will be closed to non-affiliates during Sunday, April 20.  The kiosks at the two entrances to campus will be staffed from regular Saturday evening hours, beginning at 8 p.m., through all day Sunday, ending, Monday at 6 a.m.  Proof of affiliation will be required, per standard operating procedures. The West Entrance to campus will be closed to inbound vehicular traffic on Sunday. The Main Entrance will be open that day, but campus personnel will restrict vehicular access to people who have UCSC parking permits or who can show evidence they are attending sanctioned campus events that day.</p><p>Students who live off campus and wish to drive onto campus during this period will need to present both a University Parking Permit and a Student ID.</p><p>Guests attending pre-approved campus events must also have a parking permit or park in metered spaces.</p><p>Drivers and passengers who can't prove that they have a legitimate reason to be on campus on Sunday will be turned away at the main gate.  People can anticipate that there will be delays at the Main Entrance's kiosk.</p><p>o	Alcohol and illegal substances:  Possession, consumption or sale of alcoholic beverages and illegal substances are prohibited.</p><p>o	Guests:  Your guests and their behavior on campus are your</p><p>responsibility.  Violation of federal, state, or University policy by you and/or your guests, are subject to the Student Code of Conduct.  Please refer to the following web sites for specific detail:</p><p><a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/handbook.shtml">http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/handbook.shtml</a></p><p>o	University Housing Guest Policy:  For students who live in</p><p>University Housing, the Guest Policy for student residences will be suspended on Saturday and Sunday night, April 19 and April 20.  Residents will not be permitted to have overnight guests on these evenings. Exceptions to this restriction should be made in consultation with your respective Coordinator for Residential Education or Residential Manager.</p><p>o	Student Behavior:  Behaviors that are violations of federal and state law and University policy, as outlined in the Student Handbook, including violations related to the possession, consumption, distribution, or sale of marijuana will be subject to citing by University Police or referral to the Student Judicial Affairs by Residential Staff, Community Safety Officers or other campus officials.  Please refer to the following web sites for specific detail: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/handbook.shtml">http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/handbook.shtml</a></p><p>o	Parking:  Parking permits will be required in all campus lots</p><p>throughout the weekend, even in those that typically require no permits on weekends. The parking restriction will include evening hours on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights. (If you need to park on campus this weekend and do not currently have a permit, you will need to purchase one by 6 p.m. on Friday.)  Residential Students who wish to park on campus throughout the weekend will be required to have a parking permit on your car or you may be ticketed.</p><p>Parking will be strictly enforced on Empire Grade road, campus roads and all campus parking lots.  For safety and welfare of drivers and</p><p>pedestrians, any cars parked on Empire Grade road on Sunday, April 20, will be towed at the owner's expense.</p><p>o	Campus transportation:  Metro bus drivers, at the University's</p><p>request, will not bring riders onto campus on Sunday. The only "campus" stop, coming to and from UCSC, will be the one adjacent to the Main Entrance. (If disability transportation is needed as a result of this restriction, special van service on campus can be requested at this one bus stop.)  There will be no on-campus shuttle service during the day on Sunday.</p><p>o	Vending:  Vendors of food and merchandise will not be permitted on campus, including vending from any of our campus members or groups, without permission and according to our vending regulations.  Please refer to the following web site:</p><p><a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/Comm_Act_Policy.pdf">http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/Comm_Act_Policy.pdf</a></p><p>While these measures may be an inconvenience for many in our community, I am hopeful that they will assist the campus in managing the sizeable crowd that may gather throughout the weekend and on Sunday.

<p>"The problem is how to build a large-scale data storage system to last 50 to 100 years," said Ethan Miller, associate professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Tape libraries are widely used for data storage, but digital tape has many shortcomings as an archival medium. Miller's group has come up with a new approach, called Pergamum, which uses hard disk drives to provide energy-efficient, cost-effective storage. The declining cost of hard drives has made them more competitive with tape, and they offer numerous advantages for searching and retreiving data. "It's like the difference between a VCR and TiVo," Miller said.</p>
<p>Pergamum, named after the ancient Greek library that made the transition from fragile papyrus to more durable parchment, is a distributed network of intelligent, disk-based storage devices. The team that developed it includes UCSC graduate students Mark Storer and Kevin Greenan, along with researcher Kaladhar Voruganti of NetApp (formerly Network Appliance), a company that focuses on storage and data management solutions.</p>
<p>Archival storage is a big issue for businesses, partly due to legal requirements for the preservation of financial and business records, and also because data mining strategies can turn stored data into a valuable resource. Long-term storage is also a growing issue for individuals who are filling their personal computers with digital photos, movies, and documents.</p>
<p>"There is a risk that an entire generation's cultural history could be lost if people aren't able to retrieve that data," Storer said. "Everyone is switching to digital cameras, but we've never demonstrated that digital data can be reliably preserved for a long time."</p>
<p>Pergamum has attracted a lot of attention from industry since Storer presented it at a leading conference in the field, the USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '08), held in San Jose in February. Robin Harris, an industry consultant who writes an influential blog called StorageMojo, called the Pergamum paper his <a href="http://storagemojo.com/2008/03/14/storagemojos-favorite-fast-08-paper/">"favorite FAST '08 paper"</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers designed the system to provide reliable, energy-efficient data storage using off-the-shelf components. It also has the ability to evolve over time as storage technologies change. "You want to avoid 'forklift upgrades,' where you have to get rid of the old system and transfer all your data to a whole new system," Miller said.</p>
<p>According to Storer, businesses are beginning to recognize that archival storage is very different from simply backing up their data. "A backup is a safety net--you hope you won't need it. Archival data you do want to use--it's a valuable resource and you want to be able to mine it for information," he said.</p>
<p>Tapes work well for backups, in which data are written once, rarely read, and not kept indefinitely. But archival data should be easy to read, query, browse, and search, and tape has inherent weaknesses in these areas. Existing disk-based systems offer excellent performance, but rely on power-hungry central controllers.</p>
<p>"Energy usage is a big issue, so a lot of our effort in designing Pergamum focused on dramatically reducing power use," Miller said.</p>
<p>Pergamum uses individual building blocks consisting of a hard drive; a small, low-power processor (like the chip in an iPhone); a flash memory card; and an ethernet port. These units, called "tomes," are connected using relatively inexpensive ethernet switches.</p>
<p>"Each tome is like a minicomputer, but with very low power demands," Miller said. "When not in use, it can shut down almost completely."</p>
<p>Even when active, the devices use very little power (less than 13 watts), which can be delivered over the network using Power over Ethernet technology. As a result, each unit is essentially a self-contained box with a network connection. The flash memory provides low-power, persistent storage so that many operations can be performed without activating the hard drive.</p>
<p>For reliability, Pergamum uses two levels of redundancy--within and between disks--to protect from both disk failures and errors in writing data to a disk (so-called "latent sector errors"). Tomes can be easily added to expand the system or to replace failed disks. And if hard disk drives become obsolete in 10 years, Pergamum won't suffer the same fate. The system doesn't care what the actual storage medium is, as long as the device can implement the simple protocol that will allow it to function as part of the network.</p>
<p>"In 50 years, the devices might use holographic storage," Storer said. "As long as you can wrap the new storage medium in this intelligent layer that speaks the protocol, it can participate in the network."</p>
<p>Pergamum is one of several related projects being developed by researchers in the Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC) at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. The center's other archival storage projects include Deep Store, which dramatically reduces the amount of space required to store data, and POTSHARDS, which provides long-term secure storage using "secret splitting" instead of traditional encryption. Both of these projects would be compatible with Pergamum, Miller said.</p>

I want to underscore what you've heard from the other leaders of education here today. That investing in education - in all levels of education - is an investment in the future of the state of California. </p><p>We're standing together today to show that our institutions are very much linked.</p><p>We are united in our support of continued investment in education. If you think about it, cutting an economic engine that produces an educated workforce and creates jobs and new revenue for the state will only hinder the state's economic recovery.</p><p>It's kind of like a farmer cutting off or destroying his or her seed corn. You just don't do it if you want to have a future. </p><p>In a way it's a little bit crazy. The CSU system and the UC system expend a great deal of effort training teachers. We've made a commitment to train teachers in all fields, especially in science and math. </p><p>What are we reading in the newspapers? We're reading about school districts that are sending layoff notices to teachers telling them that they're not sure they can continue to have a job with them come this fall. Is that crazy or what?</p><p>We need the resources to do what we do best - that is teaching, research, and public service at the University of California. It all begins at the K through 12 level and continues at community colleges and at the CSU system. </p><p>For UC there's a $417-million gap between the budget that the UC Regents adopted and what was proposed in the January budget of the Governor.</p><p>We of course recognize the severity of this year's budget problem. But we think that California needs to see the value of education and supporting education and investing in education.   </p><p>Like the CSU system, for us access is a key factor for what we do. </p><p>There is a strong demand for a UC education. At UC Santa Cruz we saw an enormous increase in freshman applications to nearly 28,000 this year. And more than 5,000 transfer applications. </p><p>This year, the University of California system is providing a place to all qualified students. But we can't guarantee that again for next year. </p><p>Who will be squeezed out? Well it's kind of obvious. 38 percent of UC students come from families where neither parent has a college education.</p><p>35 percent of our students come from very low-income families. </p><p>In fact, cuts to higher education are going to make it more difficult for those students to pay for college. It will make it more difficult for those students to get into the classes that they need to graduation in a timely way, and it will make it more difficult for those students to obtain the college services that they need. </p><p>These are students who are going into the workforce with the skills that they need to move the state forward. </p><p>For example, UC supports the largest health sciences program in the nation and we train at UC two-thirds of the medical students in the state of California. </p><p>In fact, last fall, 55 UC Santa Cruz students went on to medical school. </p><p>Graduates in our Health Sciences major go on to work in more of the health professions.</p><p>This year we expect to graduate 2,800 students with bachelors, masters, Ph.Ds. These are students who go on to get jobs in all sectors of our economy. </p><p>Our engineering alumni work in companies like Apple, Google, Yahoo, Intel, and IBM. Then contribute to the economic well being of the state of California. </p><p>They show that investment in education pays off many times over.</p><p>You know, John F. Kennedy once said: "Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, when fulfilled, can be translated for the benefit of everyone and the greater strength of our nation. </p><p>We all believe that in this state we need a bipartisan approach to next year's budget that will balance long-term spending and revenues.  </p><p>We urge the Governor and the Legislature to find ways to minimize cuts to all sectors of public education. Now is the time to invest in education. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915657278072704601a012ffa7d87ffb"><name>2135</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor's wife promotes post-graduate education</title><summary>UC Hastings College of the Law professor Kelly Weisberg--who is also Chancellor Blumenthal's wife--was on campus last week as a panelist in a workshop introducing potential post-graduate students to law school and advising them on law school admission and</summary><author>Gwen Mickelson, (831) 459-5312; gwenm@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Kelly Weisberg, UC Hastings, Pacific McGeorge</keywords><description>UC Hastings College of the Law professor Kelly Weisberg--who is also Chancellor Blumenthal's wife--was on campus last week as a panelist in a workshop introducing potential post-graduate students to law school and advising them on law school admission and</description><start-date>1208761200000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor's wife promotes post-graduate...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2135</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2135</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338608874</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338608874</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Mickelson</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>(831) 459-2495</phone><email>gwenm@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/04/images/weisberg.kelly.with.student.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/04/images/weisberg.kelly.with.student.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>weisberg.kelly.with.student.300.jpg</name><file-size>16917</file-size><width>300</width><height>307</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Kelly Weisberg, UC Hastings professor and wife of Chancellor George Blumenthal, answers a student's questions after the pre-law workshop. (Photo by Gwen Mickelson)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Kelly Weisberg is a strong believer in the motto, "If you can dream it, you can do it."</p>
<p>That belief was part of what brought the UC Hastings College of the Law professor to the UCSC campus last week, as a panelist in a workshop introducing potential post-graduate students to law school and advising them on law school admission and student life.</p>
<p>Another reason for Weisberg's visit: She's Chancellor George Blumenthal's wife. Because of that connection, elevating UCSC's national profile is also among her goals.</p>
<p>"It's important for our students to pursue their dreams, and for us to help them pursue their dreams," Weisberg said after the seminar. Also, she said, an event for pre-law students, as well as encouraging more UCSC students to go on to graduate or professional school of any sort, "enhances the reputation of the campus."</p>
<p>For fall 2007, 238 UCSC students, graduate students, or alumni applied to law school, said Joan Walker, advising services manager and career advisor. That number fits in with the campus's annual average-typically, 240-250 students and alumni apply to law school, according to Walker.</p>
<p>Along with Weisberg, who's taught at Hastings for 25 years, the two other panelists at the seminar were Adam Barrett, dean of admissions at the University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law, and Greg Canada, director of admissions for UC Hastings.</p>
<p>Close to 20 students attended and had a chance hear overviews on law school admissions and student life. They also got to ask questions about internships, the homework burden in law school, whether their undergraduate school made a difference in acceptance, and what admissions officers look for in applications.</p>
<p>The panelists offered advice on admission, saying there's more to a candidate than grade-point averages and test scores.</p>
<p>"Leadership, a sense of purpose, giving back to the community--those are things I look for through the application," said Pacific McGeorge's Barrett. "Wanting to have an impact and make a difference--those are the type of people I'm looking for, who can bring different characteristics to the program."</p>
<p>They advised students to do three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tell admissions officers about themselves. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Follow application instructions. <br/>
<br/>

</li>
<li>Write well.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>For attendee Chris Bamberger, 22, a fourth-year history major, the seminar was a good way to start getting information about a potential career choice.</p>
<p>"I'm going to be graduating in a few months, and I don't have a lot of plans for what I'm going to do," Bamberger said. "I'm interested in law school because I think it's something I'd be good at."</p>
<p>The seminar was helpful, he said, but he also plans on checking out other schools in subsequent law school information sessions planned for this week and mid May.</p>

<p>"We wanted to bring them the excitement we have on our campus," said Acting Director of Admissions Michael McCawley. "The academic programs, support services, and activities."</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal and approximately two dozen UCSC staffers from admissions, housing, financial aid, career services, and public safety traveled to San Gabriel, Irvine, San Jose, and Oakland. This was the second year the admissions office held regional receptions in an effort to court select admitted students.</p>
<p>McCawley said he made a special effort this year to invite a broader group of students. The tally of attendees showed the audience was more diverse than it was last year. "We had a rich diversity of top-end students, students who are first in their family to attend college, and students from low-income families," McCawley said.</p>
<p>Blumenthal spoke at all four receptions. He was joined by faculty members Lisa Sloan in Southern California, Alison Galloway in San Jose, and Lori Kletzer in Oakland. Also speaking were college provosts, a student, an alum, and financial aid representatives.</p>
<p>Blumenthal told attendees that UCSC is the leading institution for undergraduate education, offering the benefits of a small-college experience with the resources of a major research university.</p>
<p>A total of 903 admitted students attended, along with 1,227 parents or other guests. Responses were positive, as were follow-up surveys, McCawley said.</p>
<p>The receptions are a way to introduce UCSC to more people than just those who attended, according to McCawley.</p>
<p>"I really think they take this back to their communities and talk about the experience of getting to know UC Santa Cruz," he said.</p>

Admission to all screenings is by voluntary donation.</p><p>. Pedro Joel Espinosa, an undergraduate majoring in community studies, facilitated the making of an "observational documentary" entitled <i>SIN Verguenza (Shameless Voices)</i>, about the experiences of UCSC students from migrant backgrounds. The students featured in the film, which is a work-in-progress, include Espinosa; all are members of an organization called Students Informing Now, a support group that does educational outreach to middle-school, high-school, and college students regarding issues faced by students from immigrant, working class backgrounds.</p><p>. Laura Fishman, who is also majoring in community studies, made a film about the strike by members of the Writers Guild of America. Fishman was living in Burbank during the strike last fall and saw firsthand how people can come together to make social change and influence major corporations. </p><p>. Elissa Moon is a graduate student in UCSC's Social Documentation program. Her film, <i>Bad About Being Korean</i>, profiles the experiences of Moon and her family of working-class Korean immigrants. </p><p>. Claire Harbage, a history major, made a film entitled <i>Together We're Stronger</i>, which profiles the lives of three UCSC campus service workers who are AFSCME union members.</p><p>Another film screening that night, <i>Overcoming Adversity</i>, tells the story of Neidi Dominguez, a community studies major graduating this June who, like many immigrant students, overcame numerous obstacles to attain a college education. In addition, the evening will feature a slide show by UCSC student photographer Bradley Stuart of a February 2007 student/worker solidarity march, and live performances by Kinetic Poets, UCSC's slam poetry team, and the UCSC Rainbow Theater. </p><p>In its seventh year, the Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival is coorganized by Paul Ortiz, associate professor of community studies at UCSC. An annual celebration of International Workers' Day, the festival presents films, music, dramatic performances, slam poetry, and conversations with documentary film makers, immigrant activists, and union organizers about the past, present, and future of the labor movement. </p><p>"This year we're encouraging Central Coast residents to support the immigrant rights movement, which is bringing workers together in the struggle for dignity and justice," said Ortiz.</p><p>Highlights of this year's festival include <i>The Power of Song</i>, a film about the legendary folk singer Pete Seeger, which will screen at 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 1, at the Del Mar Theater in downtown Santa Cruz. Film maker Jim Brown will be on hand to discuss the making of the film.</p><p>The documentary <i>Made in L.A.</i> will screen at 2 p.m. on Saturday, April 26, at the Calvary Episcopal Church at 532 Center Street in downtown Santa Cruz. Film maker Almudena Carracedo will attend the screening and be available for discussion.</p><p>The film <i>911: Dust and Deceit</i>, which exposes the environmental disaster of 9/11 in New York City, will screen at 7 p.m. on Monday, April 28, at Community Television of Santa Cruz County in downtown Santa Cruz. After the screening, film maker Penny Little will lead a discussion about the film.</p><p>Full schedule information about the Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival is available <a href="http://www.reelwork.org">online</a>.

We are now pleased to announce its completion. To download the report, please visit the campus sustainability website:</p><p><a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu">http://sustainability.ucsc.edu</a></p><p>The report helps us and the larger community better understand our sustainability related successes and identifies areas for improvement in sustainability efforts. It also establishes a basis for measuring progress over time. It is the work of over 60 staff, faculty, and students who pooled their collective knowledge to create this important milestone in building a sustainable campus.</p><p>This Assessment illuminates a number of striking features regarding UCSC's commitment to sustainability. Some of the greatest successes have been in the areas of energy, food, land preservation, transportation, water, and curriculum and co-curricular opportunities. For example:</p><p>* Since 2006, and thanks to UCSC students, UCSC purchases 100% of its energy from renewable sources, making it the 6th largest renewables purchaser in higher education in the United States.</p><p>* Over 60% of campus commuters use alternatives to single occupancy vehicles and UCSC has won several awards for its innovative transportation programs. These include a bike shuttle, vanpools, student bus passes, and a carsharing program.</p><p>* 55% of campus land is designated as protected natural landscape.</p><p>* According to a recent water audit, water consumption per capita fell 40% since the 1980's.</p><p>* Approximately 25% of produce served in dining halls is organic, with much of it coming from local providers.</p><p>* From the integration of campus and forest, to the avoidance of air conditioners for comfort, to the use of small-scale storm water conveyance systems that protect the natural environment, building and land use design has long prioritized environmental stewardship.</p><p>* The campus has won national and international recognition for innovative student learning opportunities such as the Education for Sustainable Living Program and the College 8 Environmental Service Learning Project.</p><p>While the campus celebrates its many successes, this Assessment also identifies areas that can be targeted for improvement in the coming years. In particular, there is room for improvement in recycling diversion rates, purchasing practices, and in overall planning for long-term sustainability goals.</p><p>* The UC Policy on Sustainable Practices includes many ambitious goals for Environmentally Preferable Purchasing. The campus will need to work to implement this policy in the coming years.</p><p>* The waste diversion rate is currently 32%, below the stated goal of 50% by 2008. The UC Policy on Sustainable Practices goal to achieve 75% by 2012 will take a concerted effort.</p><p>* While the campus has initiated several committees and a Pilot Sustainability Office, there is work to be done to create a shared and comprehensive vision for how to best to build on early successes so ensure UCSC will remain a leader in sustainability.</p><p>In addition, UCSC has made a strong commitment to sustainability as evidenced by the signing of the Climate Compact with the local city and county governments, UC participation in the American College and Universities Presidents Climate Commitment, and the formation of the Chancellor's Council on Climate Change. The Council is currently developing a Climate Action Plan, expected by the end of calendar year 2008, that will establish our timeline for achieving carbon neutrality.</p><p>We are issuing this report in honor of Earth Day 2008 to emphasize how important it is to us that UCSC be a truly "green" campus community.

(Photo by Jim Burns)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Protestors at last week's job fair at Colleges Nine and Ten maintained a noisy presence, while job-seekers filing into the event to check out their options said they understood the demonstrators' right to have their say.</p>
<p>Representatives of nearly 90 employing companies, non-profits, or government agencies came to this year's "Last Chance Job &amp; Internship Fair." But the protest--held mostly outside the fair--involved several dozen people focused on only one type employer: the military.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps Officer Programs and the Army Health Care Team were among the government agencies seeking qualified applicants at the fair, which attracted 800 students and a sprinkling of alumni.</p>
<p>"I don't think recruiters should be at any campus," said protestor Emerald Snow, 19, a third-year anthropology student. She held a small sign reading, "The Solomon Amendment is silly," referring to the law that allows the government to deny federal funds--including financial aid--to colleges that limit recruiting.</p>
<p>Military recruiters left the campus during the "Last Chance" fair in 2006, saying a protest that year was endangering staff and other students at the fair. At last year's fair, no military recruiters were in attendance.</p>
<p>The military recruiters stayed throughout this year's fair, despite a demonstration recruiters have come to expect. "I don't really take it too seriously. I just know that's UC Santa Cruz," said Capt. Brian Lionbarger, officer selection officer for the United States Marine Corps, who was at the event with Capt. John Paul Wheatcroft. "It has a diverse population of students: there are the anti-war students, and then there's the other spectrum of students on the opposite side. It's great to see a school like that, that's very diverse."</p>
<p>Despite its liberal reputation, UCSC is fertile ground for Marines recruitment, said Lionbarger. "Every year, we get at least two to three out of UCSC that join the Marine Corps and become an officer," Lionbarger said. He added he has never recruited someone directly from a career fair at UCSC, though perhaps people who grabbed information off the Marines table followed up later.</p>
<p>Because it has a relatively large population of students, the number of academically qualified candidates at UCSC outnumbers that at Stanford, Santa Clara University, and San Jose State, three other schools Lionbarger recruits from.</p>
<p>"UCSC is top on my list of all my schools," he said.</p>
<p>Last year, the Marines didn't come to the job fair, but that was because of timing issues, said Lionbarger. Officer candidate slots had to be filled by mid to late May, which was tight in the first place, but also he had filled all his slots that year. This year, his deadline for filling slots was pushed back to July.</p>
<p>Students going into the job fair to make contacts with potential employers ignored the protest or watched with mild interest. Most were dressed in business-like attire, providing a jarring juxtaposition with the demonstrators, many of whom wore costumes or masks.</p>
<p>"I can understand their thoughts," said Jeff Taylor, 22, a fourth-year business management and economics major who was heading into the fair. He thought the protestors should maintain a civil stance toward the job-seekers, "but I know there are some people who believe in having them here."</p>
<p>Taylor planned to check out various employers including the San Francisco Police Department and the FBI.</p>
<p>Employers at the event included those from government, education, the nonprofit sector, social services, health and science, technology, and business and finance.</p>
<p>For second-year transfer student Allison Ruble, the job fair was a chance to get exposure to various career options.</p>
<p>"I'm graduating in June, and I don't really know what I'm doing," said Ruble, 23. A career advisor recommended the fair.</p>
<p>As for the protestors, Ruble said, "It's what they believe in. They have a right to do it. It does make me a little nervous, though."</p>
<p>Protestors marched from Quarry Plaza to the site of this year's fair, University Center and the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. Shortly after the job fair began, they started banging on paint-can drums, carrying signs, shouting into bullhorns, and chanting slogans such as, "Show me what democracy looks like!" "This is what democracy looks like!"</p>
<p>"I'm against the war in Iraq," said James Illingworth, 28, a graduate student in American history, explaining his participation in the protest. "It's part of the anti-war movement at the grass roots. And I'm also against homophobia and militarism."</p>
<p>For Lionbarger, the fair helps him "build awareness of his program and the fact that you can become and officer right out of college." He added, "You don't have to go through boot camp and go through the enlisted ranks--you can attend officer candidate school."</p>
<p>For other employers, too, the job fair provides a ready talent pool of educated workers.</p>
<p>"We're looking for critical thinkers," said Vic Kalata, store team leader and college recruiting coordinator for Target, which partners with UCSC's Career Center.</p>
<p>From 70 to 80 percent of "executive" positions at Target-jobs such as assistant managers and store team leaders-are filled with candidates from college campuses, said Kalata.</p>
<p>As for the protest, "It's neat to see the freedom of speech," Kalata said. "The disappointing piece of the puzzle is these are students who are seniors, and this is their last chance to get a job. Sometimes the protestors can disrupt that."</p>

Just ask the <em>Animal Planet</em> crew that filmed anthropology's Erin Vogel for a program scheduled to air Tuesday, May 6.</p>
<p>"It was definitely the hardest location that crew had shot," recalled Vogel, an associate researcher and lecturer in anthropology whose study of orangutans is the subject of the program. "The crew was amazing, but they really didn't like the mosquitoes and the heat. They had to get used to sweating through all of their clothes and always being wet."</p>
<p>Part of a five-part series called "Raw Nature," the segment featuring Vogel focuses on the feeding behaviors of the great apes. Her research was featured in a story in <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/06-12/orangutans.asp">Currents Online</a>.</p>
<p>The shoot was a first for Vogel. "It was really tiring, actually," she said. "At first I was a little nervous. I'd never been on camera before, so we had to do a lot of takes."</p>
<p><em>Animal Planet</em> flew Vogel to Borneo in January 2007 for the 10-day shoot, which took place at the remote research station where her fieldwork is based. The rustic accommodations weren't quite what the crew was used to, she noted.</p>

<p><!-- <table align="RIGHT" valign="TOP" border="0" cellpadding="9" width="50%"><tr><td width="5"></td><td BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><b><font color="#333333"><b>The press conference was streamed live from this <a href="http://iclips.panthercustomer.com/gd_pressconf_stream.php">iClips web site</a>. It is expected to be available soon on the <a href="http://www.dead.net">dead.net web site</a></b>.</font></b></td></tr></table>-->Band members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart made the announcement this morning at a press conference held in the poster room of San Francisco's historic Fillmore Auditorium.</p>

<p>Documenting the history of the band from 1965 to the present, The Grateful Dead Archive will reside in the University Library's Special Collections at UC Santa Cruz. The focal point of the collection will be a dedicated room named "Dead Central," where both academic researchers and the general public will have access to the archive.</p>
<p>"The Grateful Dead Archive represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th century; UC Santa Cruz is honored to receive this invaluable gift," noted UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal. "The Grateful Dead and UC Santa Cruz are both highly innovative institutions-born the same year-that continue to make a major, positive impact on the world."</p>

<p>The Archive includes business records and correspondence, photographs, and show files with tickets and backstage passes--as well as promotional items such as flyers, posters, shirts, press clips and awards. Framed photos by renowned photographers and unreleased videos of interviews and TV appearances will be available for viewing. Large stage backdrops, stained-glass pieces, and props from live performances are also featured. An extensive collection of Deadhead fan mail and gifts is an important part of the collection.</p>
<p>"We are excited that The Grateful Dead Archive will now have a home at UC Santa Cruz," said Christine Bunting, the head of Special Collections at the University Library. "It will provide extraordinary opportunities for researchers and the public to examine the music of one of the most influential bands in history, as well as explore the cultural phenomenon of Deadheads-the most dedicated and celebrated fans in music. The study of popular culture has become an important focus in the academic disciplines of the arts, humanities and social sciences."</p>
<p>Bunting added that as it works to preserve and prepare the archive for public use, UC Santa Cruz will be forming creative partnerships with Rhino Entertainment (distributor of the band's music and home of the Grateful Dead web site, dead.net), as well as the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame and key high-tech companies in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Two foundations established by members of the Grateful Dead previously contributed to UC Santa Cruz in 2004. The Rex Foundation, founded by the Grateful Dead and friends, and the Unbroken Chain Foundation, established by Phil and Jill Lesh, each donated $10,000 to support the campus's archive of maverick composer Lou Harrison. UC Santa Cruz music professor Fred Lieberman helped to facilitate those gifts; Lieberman is coauthor of two books with band member Mickey Hart--Planet Drum and Drumming at the Edge of Magic.</p>
<p>Bunting noted that due to the monumental size and scope of the archive, a fundraising campaign is now being launched to support it and to endow a permanent Grateful Dead archivist position. She said that she anticipates the archive will be of great interest to thousands of people around the world.</p>
<p>"We looked around, and UC Santa Cruz seems the best possible home," Weir noted. "If you ever wrote the Grateful Dead a letter, you'll probably find it there!"</p>

The collection will be the largest donation ever made to the library's Special Collections Department, and it includes more than 2,000 square feet of memorabilia, artifacts, and other documents. This incomparable archive will undoubtedly become a major resource for research related to the Grateful Dead, the phenomenon of the Deadheads, American music, and popular culture during the last three decades of the 20th century.</p><p>The formal announcement of this gift will be made this morning at a press conference to be held at the Fillmore in San Francisco, a singularly appropriate venue where the band performed many times. Chancellor Blumenthal will be present to accept the archive on behalf of the campus, and he will be joined by Grateful Dead band members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart.</p><p>UCSC has a long tradition of academic interest in the Grateful Dead. Fred Lieberman, professor of music, teaches a course on the band, and he has also collaborated with Mickey Hart on two books, Planet Drum and Drumming at the Edge of Magic. It was through Professor Lieberman that we first became aware of the search for a home for the archive.</p><p>The Library will be raising funds to support the processing and preservation of the archive, and, as work on it begins, we will provide regular updates on our web site.</p><p>The press conference, which will begin at 11 a.m., will be streamed live on the web. You can access it via a link on the UCSC home page; a press release, providing more information about this substantial gift, will also be posted there at that time.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC  Community</audience><admin>Ginny Steel, University Librarian</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915666d48072704601a012ff72bf4818"><name>2146</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cowell College Provosts announce memorial for Sergio Zamora</title><start-date>1209020400000</start-date><display-name>Cowell College Provosts announce...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2146</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2146</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338612889</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338612889</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are saddened at the death of Cowell student Sergio Zamora, who passed away at his home on April 9.

Admission to all screenings is by voluntary donation.</p><p>. Pedro Joel Espinosa, an undergraduate majoring in community studies, facilitated the making of an "observational documentary" entitled <i>SIN Verguenza (Shameless Voices)</i>, about the experiences of UCSC students from migrant backgrounds. The students featured in the film, which is a work-in-progress, include Espinosa; all are members of an organization called Students Informing Now, a support group that does educational outreach to middle-school, high-school, and college students regarding issues faced by students from immigrant, working class backgrounds.</p><p>. Laura Fishman, who is also majoring in community studies, made a film about the strike by members of the Writers Guild of America. Fishman was living in Burbank during the strike last fall and saw firsthand how people can come together to make social change and influence major corporations. </p><p>. Elissa Moon is a graduate student in UCSC's Social Documentation program. Her film, <i>Bad About Being Korean</i>, profiles the experiences of Moon and her family of working-class Korean immigrants. </p><p>. Claire Harbage, a history major, made a film entitled <i>Together We're Stronger</i>, which profiles the lives of three UCSC campus service workers who are AFSCME union members.</p><p>Another film screening that night, <i>Overcoming Adversity</i>, tells the story of Neidi Dominguez, a community studies major graduating this June who, like many immigrant students, overcame numerous obstacles to attain a college education. In addition, the evening will feature a slide show by UCSC student photographer Bradley Stuart of a February 2007 student/worker solidarity march, and live performances by Kinetic Poets, UCSC's slam poetry team, and the UCSC Rainbow Theater. </p><p>In its seventh year, the Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival is coorganized by Paul Ortiz, associate professor of community studies at UCSC. An annual celebration of International Workers' Day, the festival presents films, music, dramatic performances, slam poetry, and conversations with documentary film makers, immigrant activists, and union organizers about the past, present, and future of the labor movement. </p><p>"This year we're encouraging Central Coast residents to support the immigrant rights movement, which is bringing workers together in the struggle for dignity and justice," said Ortiz.</p><p>Highlights of this year's festival include <i>The Power of Song</i>, a film about the legendary folk singer Pete Seeger, which will screen at 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 1, at the Del Mar Theater in downtown Santa Cruz. Film maker Jim Brown will be on hand to discuss the making of the film.</p><p>The documentary <i>Made in L.A.</i> will screen at 2 p.m. on Saturday, April 26, at the Calvary Episcopal Church at 532 Center Street in downtown Santa Cruz. Film maker Almudena Carracedo will attend the screening and be available for discussion.</p><p>The film <i>911: Dust and Deceit</i>, which exposes the environmental disaster of 9/11 in New York City, will screen at 7 p.m. on Monday, April 28, at Community Television of Santa Cruz County in downtown Santa Cruz. After the screening, film maker Penny Little will lead a discussion about the film.</p><p>Full schedule information about the Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival is available <a href="http://www.reelwork.org">online</a>.

This fall, she will begin a doctoral program at the UCLA Graduate School for Biomedical Research. But her interests and her passion for learning have their roots in Kenya, where she was born and raised.</p>
<p>"My passion for furthering myself with knowledge has gradually grown from my first-hand experience of seeing close family and relatives dying slowly of AIDS and from seeing homeless children suffering from malnutrition, wandering aimlessly around heaps of garbage digging for food," Tekeste said.</p>
<p>"In Africa, many believe that these diseases are a curse that cannot be overturned for sinners who do not live according to the traditional way of life," she explained. "This gets in the way of acknowledging ways to prevent and treat such diseases. It stifles research opportunities for prevention or treatment."</p>
<p>Tekeste's family was originally from Eritrea, but civil unrest there forced them to seek refuge in Kenya. She was born in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, where the family lived until five years ago, when they moved to the United States. Tekeste's family of eight--she has one sister and four bothers--joined her uncle in San Diego, where he helped them get established.</p>
<p>"We stayed with him and his family in their two-bedroom apartment--12 people collectively--for a month before my family moved into a two-bedroom apartment," she said.</p>
<p>As a 17-year-old, Tekeste found assimilation to U.S. culture difficult. "But I learned to use barriers as positive challenges that test my perseverance and to use pressure as my driving force," she said.</p>
<p>Tekeste said her strong determination for academic success derives from her upbringing. "I was raised believing that unless you acknowledge where you are coming from, you will never know where you are heading," she said.</p>
<p>Tekeste is the first from her family to graduate from high school and the first to attend a university. She has clearly made the most of the opportunities she found at UCSC, including the chance to work in a faculty research laboratory.</p>
<p>Tekeste has been working in the laboratory of Melissa Jurica, assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology. She has been supported by UCSC's Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) program and, more recently, a Diversity Award for Undergraduate Research in Genomic Sciences offered by the Center for Biomolecular Science &amp; Engineering (CBSE).</p>
<p>As a diversity-award recipient, Tekeste participates in the CBSE Research Mentoring Institute (RMI). The program provides undergraduates and graduate students with a research experience in genomic science, ensuring that they acquire the academic services and motivation to successfully graduate from the university and to enroll in an advanced degree program or enter a career in genomic science.</p>
<p>To participate in the RMI, Tekeste was required to develop a project in genomic science. She currently works in a close student-faculty mentor relationship in the Jurica lab, where she learns and uses the tools of structural biology to understand how cellular machines carry out their biochemical functions.</p>
<p>She also enjoys peer mentoring from another RMI participant, graduate student Gabriel Roybal, who also works in the Jurica lab. Roybal encouraged Tekeste to apply for the diversity award; they work closely together on projects in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Research in the Jurica lab seeks to understand a critical step in the process whereby genetic information in DNA is read and then used in cells. The step is called pre-mRNA splicing, and errors in this process are responsible for a large number of human genetic diseases.</p>
<p>"Our group uses the tools of structural biology to understand the cellular machinery that carries out splicing, called the spliceosome," Jurica explained. "Our goal is to build a three-dimensional model of the spliceosome so that we can understand how it is put together and how it works in both normal and disease situations."</p>
<p>Tekeste's project involves the structural analysis of an early phase of the spliceosome, which she purifies and prepares for imaging with an electron microscope. To improve the visualization, she engineered a special protein-binding sequence into the pre-mRNA that makes it possible to label an important part of the spliceosome structure. Tekeste and Roybal plan to use this method to improve the lab's imaging capabilities.</p>
<p>"We collect tens of thousands of electron microscope images, and then we apply software that blends them into a three-dimensional structure," Roybal said. "We label one spot on the complex to help with orientation, so that we can piece the individual pictures together like a puzzle to make the whole image."</p>
<p>Tekeste's determination in carrying out her research and in achieving academic success stems in part from a sense of responsibility to give back to her family. "I came to UCSC focused and ready to graduate early, so I could be of help financially to enable my siblings to at least get to where I am," she said.</p>
<p>The CBSE's Research Mentoring Institute strives to increase the numbers and capabilities of minority scientists and science professionals. The program is designed to allow outstanding UCSC students to pursue research projects in areas relevant to the human genome while providing academic and financial support. The institute is made possible by funding from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).</p>

Following that press event, which generated extensive national media coverage, Chancellor Blumenthal visited with the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>'s opinion/editorial board.</p>
<p>The <em>Chronicle</em> published an editorial related to his visit on today's Opinion page; the full text of that editorial follows. Below that is a sampling of regional, national, and international coverage of the band's gift to UCSC. Video and radio coverage will follow next week. All coverage will later be archived and accessible via the university web site.</p>
<p><strong><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> Editorial:</strong></p>
<p>Truckin' to UC Santa Cruz</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal likes to point out that UC Santa Cruz has outgrown its image of the 1970s. Those who might think of it as a laid-back haven of organic obsessions, long breaks to the beaches and woods and a soft-focus grading system should know that it's on "an upward trajectory" and has become one of the more selective UC campuses.</p>
<p>Blumenthal cites the five alums who won Pulitzers and the dimensions of its pioneering telescopes in Hawaii among the evidence of its growing reputation for excellence.</p>
<p>Casual observers can be forgiven for wondering how its acquisition of the Grateful Dead archives - to be showcased in the library - fits into the school's stereotype-busting vision. It does, it really does, Blumenthal told our editorial board Thursday. Not to worry, he said, there won't be a conflict between the "Dead Central" exhibit and serious students trying to focus with their noses in their books. After all, UC Santa Cruz is on the cutting edge in another way: Its entire library collection is being scanned to be available online. "The library of the 21st century is not going to be musty books sitting on shelves," he explained.</p>
<p>The chancellor proudly noted that Santa Cruz's competition for the Dead archives included UC Berkeley and Stanford. "That's the advantage of being a little smaller and hungrier," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>It's quite a coup for a campus that welcomes an intensified spotlight.</p>

In his remarks, he noted several recent campus "coups": the ongoing transformation of McHenry Library into a state-of-the-art facility, the record number of applicants for 2008-09 admission, and the recent donation of the Grateful Dead's archives. </p><p>"We are all Deadheads now, for the moment at least," he said, to laughter and applause.</p><p>At the conclusion of Blumenthal's remarks, UCSC Alumni Association Council President Joan Fitting Scott (Stevenson '69) presented him with an oversized, ceremonial check for $301,398, representing donations made to campus so far this year by graduates celebrating their 5- through 40-year reunions-an amount almost double last year's reunion class giving.</p><p>As she awarded the Alumni Association's 2007-08 Outstanding Staff Award to Bob Hastings, director of current student services at the Division of Graduate Studies, Scott gave tribute to Hastings's efficiency, thoroughness, and student advocacy. Students feel Hastings is "their anchor, a lifesaver," she said, as he helps them navigate administrative requirements on their way to postgraduate degrees. Next, Stephen Gliessman, Heller Professor of Agroecology in environmental studies, received the Association's Distinguished Teaching Award for his engaged, inspirational, and "hands on" pedagogy and eager sponsorship of internships and senior theses.</p><p>The luncheon was briefly interrupted by sign-waiving protesters calling upon the campus to sign a contract with staff unions.</p><p>Later in the day, guests flocked to the campus's first-ever Intellectual Forum. Moderator Katy Roberts (Kresge '74), New York Times senior editor helping the paper's transition to digital media, facilitated a stimulating exchange of views on innovation and education in a global society. Panelists were "innovation guru" John Kao, Silicon Valley CEO Shellye Archambeau, and nationally syndicated columnist and social critic Victor Davis Hanson (Cowell '75). (See "<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2156">Innovation seen emerging from new 'smooshes</a>.'") </p><p>At the forum's conclusion, guests enjoyed wines from alumni vintners at Saintsbury Vineyard, Bonny Doon Vineyard, and Ursa Vineyards.</p><p>"We are grateful to the entire campus community for opening its arms to alumni, offering almost 40 different Reunion Weekend receptions, reunions, and showcase events," said Alumni Association Executive Director Carolyn Christopherson. "Faculty, staff, students, and others with whom they interact create an enduring connection between graduates and the campus, facilitating ever-greater levels of support."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156776d8072704601a012ffd27fffd8"><name>2155</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renee Tajima-Peña's film wins documentary prize at film festival, premieres May 4</title><summary>Renee Tajima-Peña's film &lt;i&gt;Calavera Highway&lt;/i&gt;, named the best television documentary by the San Francisco International Film Festival, will premiere during the festival on Sunday, May 4, at the Sundance Kabuki Cinemas.</summary><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>tajima-pena, film, documentary, award, calavera highway, community studies</keywords><description>Renee Tajima-Peña's film &lt;i&gt;Calavera Highway&lt;/i&gt;, named the best television documentary by the San Francisco International Film Festival, will premiere during the festival on Sunday, May 4, at the Sundance Kabuki Cinemas.</description><start-date>1209366000000</start-date><display-name>Renee Tajima-Peña's film wins...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2155</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2155</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338617106</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338617106</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Community Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/04/images/tajima_pena_mom.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/04/images/tajima_pena_mom.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tajima_pena_mom.300.jpg</name><file-size>56778</file-size><width>300</width><height>247</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Renee Tajima-Pena's new film follows the family odyssey of the seven Pena brothers.

<p>"That's where real innovation comes from," said Kao, defining a "smoosh" as new collaborations or combinations. "New knowledge begins to emerge at the margins of traditional disciplines," he said.</p>
<p>Kao, who has been called an innovation guru, made his comments Saturday afternoon during a panel discussion "Innovation and Education in a Global Society" at the Humanities Lecture Hall, part of Alumni Reunion Weekend. (Missed the Intellectual Forum? <a href="http://intellectualforum.ucsc.edu/forum08.shtml">Watch the video now</a>.)</p>
<p>Mashing things up also means adopting a "beginner's mind," in Zen terms, he said. In an educational or corporate context it means pushing departments together and tearing down silos. It also means being prepared "to tolerate the inherent messiness."</p>
<p>Also speaking Saturday were author and commentator Victor Davis Hanson, a 1975 Cowell alumnus, and Shellye Archambeau, an expert in globalization for corporations. Moderating was Katy Roberts, a 1974 Kresge alumna, who has worked at the <em>New York Times</em> for 26 years and is now a senior editor at nytimes.com.</p>
<p>In kicking off the event, Chancellor George Blumenthal touted UC Santa Cruz's culture of innovation and interdisciplinary approach to research and teaching. The campus was innovative when it was founded and continues to be today, he said. "You might say innovation is in our DNA."</p>
<p>Blumenthal cited Bioinformatics, Digital Arts and New Media, and the STEPS Institute as examples of departments and programs that cut across traditional boundaries.</p>
<p>Hanson spoke passionately for classical liberal education, calling it "long-term inductive training." And he called for renewed respect for undergraduate teaching, receiving one of two spontaneous ovations from the audience of 200. A university needs research to inform undergraduate education but increasingly research universities "don't reward undergraduate education," he said.</p>
<p>(The other ovation came when he blasted the current administration's policy of promoting ethanol production.)</p>
<p>Hanson is a professor emeritus of classics at California State University, Fresno and a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. In 1991 he won an American Philological Association Excellence in Teaching Award, given yearly to the country's top undergraduate teachers of Greek and Latin. His daughter is a UC Santa Cruz undergraduate.</p>
<p>"Education is like water," Hanson said. "It doesn't change." A liberal education is needed to "translate the daily chaos into an abstract wisdom of the ages," he said.</p>
<p>Archambeau cited "ideas, people, and money" as the three things that fuel innovation. She also cautioned that global economic phenomena such as off-shoring, while disruptive in the short term, have the potential for long-term positive impact.</p>
<p>Roberts said she was pleased to find a global awareness at UC Santa Cruz, her alma mater. "I find this an extraordinary thing," she said. Roberts studied Russian at the University of Toronto in the 1970s and received her masters in Russian area studies and journalism at the University of Indiana.</p>
<p>Kao, who works with Finland and Singapore, among other governments, to help develop a culture of innovation, decried that little is being done in the U.S. on a national policy level.</p>
<p>"We know very little how to practice innovation on a systemic level," he said.</p>
<p>"Innovation is not just inventing new stuff to sell at a profit. It is supporting a set of big ideas," Kao said.</p>
<p>"We need a set of big ideas on what it means to be innovative in a global context," he continued. "We are in a pre-Copernican era in terms of innovation."</p>

<p>Lay was among 212 new fellows and honorary members of the academy announced this week. He joins 23 other UCSC faculty who are fellows of the academy. Drawn from the sciences, the arts and humanities, business, public affairs, and the nonprofit sector, the newly elected members are recognized leaders in their fields. They include Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, Nobel Prize winners Linda Buck and Craig Mello, filmmakers Ethan and Joel Cohen, and blues guitarist B.B. King.</p>
<p>An eminent seismologist, Lay is known for his contributions to earthquake seismology, the use of seismic waves to probe the structure of the deep Earth, and the development of methods for monitoring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He has served on many national and international committees, including the board of directors of the Incorporated Research Insitutions for Seismology (IRIS), which operates a global network of seismic monitoring stations. As chair of the board of IRIS, Lay organized the scientific analysis of the great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 2004.</p>
<p>"The academy honors excellence by electing to membership remarkable men and women who have made preeminent contributions to their fields, and to the world," said academy president Emilio Bizzi. "We are pleased to welcome into the academy these new members to help advance our founders' goal of 'cherishing knowledge and shaping the future.'"</p>
<p>At UCSC, Lay has served as founding director of the UCSC branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP), director of the Institute of Tectonics, and chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. He currently directs the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth, part of the IGPP. Lay earned a B.S. in geomechanics at the University of Rochester and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in geophysics at the California Institute of Technology. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1989.</p>

Car sharing is essentially a membership-based car rental program that allows members access to vehicles without the need for car ownership. UCSC has seven Zipcar vehicles conveniently located both on and off campus, including 2300 Delaware and the University Town Center in downtown Santa Cruz.</p><p>While this program is primarily intended for personal travel needs, we are pleased to announce that Zipcar can now also be used for short-term UC business-related trips. Departments interested in participating must first establish a Zipcar Department Account, at a cost of $100 per year. Staff and faculty authorized by that department then register individually at no additional charge. (Student workers 18 years of age and older are also eligible to apply under a departmental account.)</p><p>Use fees for Zipcar (which include fuel, insurance and parking costs) start at $8 per hour or $65 per day, and may be used up to 24 hours or 180 miles round-trip on a business-related trip. (UC Fleet Services and/or rental car services should be used for trips that exceed these limitations.) Zipcar fees can be charged to a UC ProCard, UC Corporate travel card, or personal credit card. Details on how to apply for departmental Zipcar accounts can be found at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps">http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps</a>.</p><p>I encourage all staff and faculty to learn more about this exciting new program at <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/ucsc/">www.zipcar.com/ucsc</a>.

Election to the academy is considered one of the highest honors that can be accorded a scientist or engineer. Max joins 12 other UCSC faculty who are members of the academy.</p><p>"Claire Max is widely admired for her many contributions to plasma physics, astronomy, and astronomical instrumentation," said Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. </p><p>Max is a pioneer in the field of adaptive optics, a technology that removes the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing telescopes on the ground to see as clearly as if they were in space. A coinventor of the laser guide star technique for astronomical adaptive optics, she has helped revolutionize the capabilities of ground-based telescopes. </p><p>Max directs the Center for Adaptive Optics, a Science and Technology Center funded by the National Science Foundation and headquartered at UCSC. She has been active in the development of advanced adaptive optics systems for current and future large ground-based telescopes. Her current research in astronomy involves the use of adaptive optics to study merging black holes at the centers of galaxies. </p><p>Earlier in her career, Max studied the plasma physics aspects of laser fusion at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). She made important contributions to laser-plasma interactions and to the understanding of astrophysical plasmas. </p><p>A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Max received the E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics in 2004. She earned her A.B. degree in astronomy from Harvard University (Radcliffe College) and her Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences and plasma physics from Princeton University. Max joined the UCSC faculty in 1999. </p><p>Max is among 72 new members whose election to the academy was announced today. The National Academy of Sciences is a private organization of scientists and engineers dedicated to the furtherance of science and its use for the general welfare. It was established in 1863 by a congressional act of incorporation signed by Abraham Lincoln that calls on the academy to act as an official adviser to the federal government, upon request, in any matter of science or technology.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9156813c8072704601a012ff34676ef2"><name>2161</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Compact galaxies in early universe pack a big punch</title><summary>A team of astronomers looking at galaxies in the universe's distant past have discovered nine young, compact galaxies, each weighing in at 200 billion times the mass of the Sun.</summary><author>Donna Weaver, STScI, (410) 338-4493, dweaver@stsci.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Garth Illingworth, galaxies</keywords><description>A team of astronomers looking at galaxies in the universe's distant past have discovered nine young, compact galaxies, each weighing in at 200 billion times the mass of the Sun.</description><start-date>1209452400000</start-date><display-name>Compact galaxies in early...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2161</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2161</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338619617</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338619617</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2008/04/images/comparison_350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2008/04/images/comparison_350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>comparison_350.jpg</name><file-size>62465</file-size><width>350</width><height>292</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>This illustration shows the comparative sizes of our Milky Way Galaxy and an ultracompact galaxy in the early universe.

Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, to study the galaxies as they existed 11 billion years ago, when the universe was less than 3 billion years old. </p><p>"Seeing the compact sizes of these galaxies is a puzzle," said Pieter G. van Dokkum of Yale University, who led the study. "No massive galaxy at this distance has ever been observed to be so compact. These galaxies would have to change a lot over 11 billion years, growing five times bigger. They could get larger by colliding with other galaxies, but such collisions may not be the complete answer. It is not yet clear how they would build themselves up to become the large galaxies we see today."</p><p>To determine the sizes of the galaxies, the team used the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer on Hubble. The Keck observations were carried out with assistance of laser-guided adaptive optics to correct for image blurring caused by the Earth's atmosphere. "Only Hubble and Keck can see the sizes of these galaxies because they are very small and far away," van Dokkum explained.</p><p>According to Illingworth, these galaxies are ideal targets for the Wide Field Camera 3, which is scheduled to be installed aboard Hubble during Servicing Mission 4 in the fall of 2008. </p><p>"We hope to use the Wide Field Camera 3 to find thousands of these galaxies. The Hubble images, together with the laser adaptive optics at Keck and similar large telescopes, should lead to a better understanding of the evolution of galaxies early in the life of the universe," Illingworth said.</p><p>In 2006, the researchers studied the galaxies with the Gemini South Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph. Those observations provided the galaxies' distances and showed that the stars are half a billion to a billion years old and that the most massive stars had already exploded as supernovae.</p><p>The ultra-dense galaxies might comprise half of all galaxies of that mass 11 billion years ago, van Dokkum said, forming the building blocks of today's largest galaxies.</p><p>"In the Hubble Deep Field, astronomers found that star-forming galaxies are small," said Marijn Franx of Leiden University, The Netherlands. "However, these galaxies were also very low in mass. They weigh much less than our Milky Way. Our study, which surveyed a much larger area than in the Hubble Deep Field, surprisingly shows that galaxies with the same weight as our Milky Way were also very small in the past. All galaxies look really different in early times, even massive ones that formed their stars early."</p><p>Based on the galaxies' mass, which is derived from their color, the astronomers estimated that the stars are spinning around their galactic disks at roughly 890,000 to 1 million miles an hour (400 to 500 kilometers a second). Stars in today's galaxies, by contrast, are traveling at about half that speed because they are larger and rotate more slowly than the compact galaxies.</p><p>The findings appeared in the April 10 issue of <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters</i>.</p><p>For images and more information about the compact galaxies, visit the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/news/2008/15">Hubble web site</a>.</p><p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) and is managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Md.

The announcements were made today.</p><p>Max was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of her distinguished and continuing achievements in original research. She joins 12 other UCSC faculty members in the elite academy. (<a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2160">See UCSC press release</a>.)</p><p>Lay was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious honorary societies. He joins 23 other UCSC faculty members as fellows. (<a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2158">See UCSC press release</a>.)</p><p>"I am delighted that the National Academy of Sciences has recognized Claire's outstanding achievements by electing her as a member," Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "She has been a pioneer in the development of adaptive optics systems for very large telescopes and in their use for astronomical observations."</p><p>Blumenthal said he was "extremely pleased" by Lay's election to the AAAS. "Besides his outstanding teaching and service to the campus, Thorne has made major contributions to our understanding of Earth science in areas ranging from the earthquake rupture process, to the nature of the core-mantle boundary, to how the United States can monitor the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."</p><p>Dave Kliger, executive vice chancellor and campus provost, said he was "very pleased to see the recognition of two of our outstanding faculty members. These are certainly well-deserved honors for both of them."</p><p>Bruce Margon, vice chancellor of research, said the elections of Max and Lay are the "latest examples of the growing number of UC Santa Cruz faculty who are at the top of their fields in all disciplines."</p><p>Max is a pioneer in the field of adaptive optics, a technology that removes the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing telescopes on the ground to see as clearly as if they were in space. Her current research in astronomy involves the use of adaptive optics to study merging black holes at the centers of galaxies.</p><p>Lay, an eminent seismologist, has served on many national and international committees, including the board of directors of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), which operates a global network of seismic monitoring stations. As chair of the board of IRIS, Lay organized the scientific analysis of the great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 2004.</p><p>Lay has served as founding director of the UCSC branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, (IGPP), director of the Institute of Tectonics, and chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. He currently directs the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth, part of the IGPP. Lay earned a B.S. in geomechanics at the University of Rochester and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in geophysics at the California Institute of Technology. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1989.</p><p>Max directs the Center for Adaptive Optics, headquartered at UCSC. She is among 72 new members of the NAS, a private organization of scientists and engineers established in 1863 by a congressional act of incorporation signed by Abraham Lincoln that calls on the academy to act as an official adviser to the federal government, upon request, in any matter of science or technology.</p><p>She is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Max received the E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics in 2004. She earned her A.B. degree in astronomy from Harvard University (Radcliffe College) and her Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences and plasma physics from Princeton University. She joined the UCSC faculty in 1999.</p><p>Lay was among 212 new fellows and honorary members in the AAAS, drawn from the sciences, arts and humanities, business, public affairs, and the nonprofit sector. Newly elected members include Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, Nobel Prize winners Linda Buck and Craig Mello, filmmakers Ethan and Joel Cohen, and blues guitarist B.B. King. The AAAS was founded in 1780 by John Adams, James Bowdoin, John Hancock, and other scholar patriots.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC  Community</audience><admin>Office of Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915832558072704601a012ffeb2ba181"><name>2473</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>About the 4/20 event</title><start-date>1208761200000</start-date><display-name>About the 4/20 event...</display-name><path>/2008/04/2473</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/2473</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338730477</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338730477</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>-- This is an unsanctioned event on our campus, and we are not happy that UCSC is one of the campuses on which it takes place. Last week, our Student Affairs Vice Chancellor sent the following message to all students reiterating that point: <a href="http://messages.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2126">messages.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=2126</a></p><p>-- Since the event is based on the consumption of an illegal drug, by its very nature this unsanctioned event is in conflict with <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/judicial/student-conduct07.pdf">UCSC's Student Code of Conduct</a>. Through this code of conduct, we make it clear to all students that we expect them to abide by all laws and campus regulations. Students who violate laws and/or campus regulations subject themselves to the possibility of court-imposed punishment and student-judicial actions.</p><p>So, why did we permit the most recent 4/20 event to happen?</p><p>-- This year, we made a decision to deploy our police officers at the two campus entrances in order to make it more difficult for people (many of whom have no affiliation with the campus) to attend this illegal and unsanctioned event. While it's impossible to state with any authority the degree to which our efforts were successful, we did turn away a number of vehicles whose occupants had no sanctioned reason for being on campus on Sunday.</p><p>Why not deploy the police on the site and order them to issue citations?</p><p>-- Given the size of this gathering in recent years, this year we decided that having officers on site attempting to issue citations would not be the most effective (and safest) way to combat this. Instead, we decided to make it as difficult as possible for people to attend. Some observers report that the event was slightly smaller than last year's; if true, this reverses a many-year trend of it growing in size on this campus.</p><p>-- Obviously, we remain very concerned about this activity. We are currently assessing which elements of our operations plan were helpful this year and which were not. We also believe that there is much more opportunity to discuss (and hopefully demystify) this event during orientation sessions with new students and their families.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a271683b8072704601a012ff8c028e6e"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625595371</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625595371</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a271683b8072704601a012ff8c028e6e"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2008/04/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2008/04/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282625595371</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282625595371</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
