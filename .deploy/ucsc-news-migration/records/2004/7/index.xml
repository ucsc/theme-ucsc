It will also be the first doctoral program established in the fine arts at UC Santa Cruz, marking a significant milestone in the expansion of arts graduate programs at the Santa Cruz campus.</p><p>"The Music Composition D.M.A will develop accomplished, active, and articulate composers with a broad awareness of the diverse styles, cultural influences, and technical means available to them in the 21st century," noted Margaret L. Delaney, interim UC Santa Cruz campus provost and executive vice chancellor.</p><p>Graduate students who choose to specialize in the area of computer-assisted composition will be trained in the use of algorithmic techniques, which have been increasingly applied to the creation of music and art works. This approach involves composing a piece of music via a set of instructions (a program) given to a computer. The composer may utilize the program to create a piece in whole or in part, and the computer output may be accepted as a complete work or manipulated further to create a final piece of music.</p><p>The Computer-Assisted composition track of the new doctorate program will be led by award-winning composer and UC Santa Cruz music professor David Cope, along with composer colleagues Paul Nauert, Peter Elsea, and David Evan Jones and cognitive theorist Ben Carson.  In 1981, Cope created the groundbreaking computer program, Experiments in Musical Intelligence (EMI), which is described in his books Computers and Musical Style, Experiments in Musical Intelligence, The Algorithmic Composer, and Virtual Music. The program functions by extracting elements of a composer's style from a database of compositions and then creating new works in that style. Cope is recognized internationally as one of the world's leading composers using algorithmic techniques.</p><p>The World Music specialty of the new UC Santa Cruz program will focus on the music of indigenous non-Western composers, reflecting the incorporation of world music cultures into Western art and music that has paralleled the growing ethnic diversification of American society.  Music faculty at UC Santa Cruz currently teach and conduct research in the music of Korea, China, Indonesia, India, Latin America, Africa and the United States.</p><p>The World Music track will be led by UC Santa Cruz music professor Hi Kyung Kim along with composer/performer Karlton Hester.  Kim is internationally recognized for her powerful fusions of Western classical music with traditional techniques and instruments from her native Korea.  Hester composes and performs music in a variety of styles influenced by global African music. </p><p> "Each student will focus on one or more world music cultures and strive to understand that music-on its own terms and in its own context-before integrating aspects of that music with Western classical music," noted UC Santa Cruz music professor David Evan Jones. "This will be the first doctoral program of which I'm aware that explicitly requires the study of world music as the foundation for a course of study in composition," he added.</p><p>Many of the elements of the new D.M.A. in composition are on display each spring at UC Santa Cruz when the campus hosts one or more of its ongoing festivals:  The April in Santa Cruz festival of new music is a 25-year tradition at UCSC, while the Festival of Global African Music is a relatively recent offering. The campus has twice hosted its internationally recognized Pacific Rim Festival of new music and, according to Jones, plans are now being made for a 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival/Conference that will draw composers, ensembles, and scholars from the U.S., Korea, Japan and Germany, and will feature concerts of algorithmic music alongside cutting edge fusions of world and Western music.</p><p>For more information about the new doctoral program, contact the UC Santa Cruz Music Department at (831) 459- 2292.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dd9f48072704601a012ffc1f5998b"><name>525</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Current problems of U.S. Senate rooted in history, says author</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1089615600000</start-date><display-name>Current problems of U.S....</display-name><path>/2004/07/525</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/525</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338052549</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338052549</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The electoral college isn't the only outdated political system that should be overhauled, according to a political scientist who says the antiquated ways of the United States Senate contribute to Congressional gridlock and thwart American democracy. </p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Expert on U.S. politics available to discuss the U.S. Senate, electoral politics, and the presidency; see contact information below.</font></b></td></tr></table>The gravest threat to fair representation is the mandate that each state elect two senators to the U.S. Senate regardless of population, a system that has created "perhaps the most unrepresentative legislative chamber in the world," says Daniel Wirls, a professor of politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and coauthor of the new book The Invention of the United States Senate (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004).</p><p>	The current system "underrepresents racial minorities and overrepresents the economic minority" because it is weighted in favor of small, more agricultural, and predominantly white states, says Wirls.</p><p>"We have a system that gives California--population 36 million--the same number of senators as South Dakota--population 755,000," he says. "It's a grotesque misrepresentation, and by all indications it's only going to get worse as people move out of the central plains states."</p><p>Wirls's book, coauthored with his brother Stephen Wirls, an associate professor of political science at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, fills a gap in the historical record by telling the story of the origins of the Senate before, during, and after the Constitutional Convention of 1787. By immersing themselves in the historical debate around the creation of the Senate and the precedents that were established in its formative years, the authors discovered the roots of some of today's most stubborn political obstacles. </p><p>"It's like the electoral college," he says. "We saw after the 2000 election that it should be changed, but no one has taken up the challenge yet. The Senate is similar. It's a very distorted form of representation that has no justification in a modern democracy. We would never design it this way if given the chance to start over. I don't think the same thing can be said about the House, President, or Supreme Court."</p><p>	</p><p>The formula for Senate representation was the product of a political compromise more than 200 years ago and should be revisited, says Wirls. </p><p>	Under the bicameral system, the Senate was intended to be a smaller, more deliberative body than the population-based House of Representatives. Senators would serve longer terms than their House counterparts and would have greater executive responsibilities. The Senate's system of representation was designed to protect states rights, a notion that Wirls contends was illfounded at the time and has since become irrelevant.</p><p>During the Constitutional Convention of 1787, fearing that the largest states would dominate the new federal government, delegates sought to avoid undue influence by giving states equal representation in the senate. "Even then, it wasn't clear what states rights they thought might be trampled, but they were fearful," says Wirls. "They thought Southern states were going to get big, but they were wrong."</p><p>Indeed, the founding fathers considered a population-based formula that would have granted each state between one and five senators, says Wirls, who believes such a system would have been more socially just.</p><p>Many of today's political ills have institutional origins that date way back, including partisan use of the filibuster to thwart legislation and derail Senate consideration of presidential appointments. Such use of the filibuster is an outgrowth of a formal mechanism called cloture that was introduced during World War I to allow senators to limit debate on a particular question. </p><p> "Ironically, a tool that was intended to increase efficiency has become the most effective way to obstruct the Senate's business," says Wirls. "It entrenched the power of the few and gave even individual senators a stranglehold on the legislative agenda."</p><p>Understanding the historical roots of contemporary problems can stimulate discussion about ways to improve government, says Wirls. Although the Senate's mechanisms of doing business have "unbelievably durable consequences," he says, they are not immune to change.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Daniel Wirls can be reached at (831) 459-2134 or via e-mail at wirls@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ddb708072704601a012ffec1b39d3"><name>526</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Growth study of wild chimpanzees challenges assumptions about early humans, anthropologists say</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1089702000000</start-date><display-name>Growth study of wild...</display-name><path>/2004/07/526</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/526</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338052923</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338052923</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new study of wild chimpanzee growth rates, published in the Early Edition of the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, suggests that early human evolution may have taken a different course than is widely believed.</p><p>	The results challenge the assumption that human evolution followed a path from a chimplike ancestor to a transitionary Homo erectus and then Homo sapiens, suggesting instead that chimpanzees have more in common developmentally with Homo erectus and that modern humans are the "out-group."</p><p>	The study was coauthored by Adrienne Zihlman, professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Debra Bolter, who just earned her doctorate in anthropology at UCSC; and Christophe Boesch, director of primatology at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.</p><p>	The researchers examined skeletal samples from 18 wild chimpanzees of known ages and compared the data to the dentition of captive chimpanzees, which have been used as a baseline for discussion of hominid origins and the transition from ape ancestors to hominids. The eruption of teeth mark other life events, such as  completion of brain growth (90 to 95 percent of brain growth is complete when the first permanent molar erupts) and life-history stages like infancy, juvenile, and adulthood. </p><p>	The team's analysis consistently showed a slower rate of development of all the teeth of wild chimpanzees compared to captive chimpanzees: Among wild chimpanzees, infancy lasted until about four years of age and mature dentition was reached between 12 and 13 years of age, compared to captive animals whose infancy ended around three years of age and who reached mature dentition about 10 years of age.</p><p>	"These findings challenge a number of assumptions about the growth of hominids," said Zihlman. "Anthropologists and paleoanthropologists have relied heavily on studies of captive chimpanzees to establish a baseline for hominid growth and to generate hypotheses about the life history and behaviors of fossil humans. We now know those scenarios are based on faulty data."</p><p>	Comparing teeth of wild chimpanzees to previous research on two Homo erectus fossil specimens, the researchers found that the first molars of both wild chimpanzees and Homo erectus emerge at about four years of age, and the second molars emerge at about eight years of age.</p><p>	"Our data suggest that wild chimpanzees and Homo erectus growth patterns may not have differed from each other as much as previously thought," said Zihlman. "These findings do not support Homo erectus developmentally as an intermediate between chimplike ancestors and modern humans. Our data also call into question the assumption that a larger body size and a big brain require a longer time to grow."</p><p>	The findings also explain why dental-eruption data derived from captive chimpanzees didn't match the life stages of wild animals observed by researchers in the field, Zihlman noted.</p><p>	The skeletal samples examined included 12 immature individuals and one young adult from the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, four immatures from Gombe National Park in Tanzania, and one immature from Bossou, Guinea.</p><p>	The paper, "Wild Chimpanzee Dentition and its Implications for Assessing Life History in Immature Hominin Fossils," is scheduled to appear in the July 20 print edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Adrienne Zihlman can be reached at (831) 459-4467 or via e-mail at azihlman@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ddd0e8072704601a012ff95e56b64"><name>527</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC seismologist Karen McNally receives University Medal from the National University of Costa Rica</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Karen McNally, Earth sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz, University Medal, National University of Costa Rica</keywords><start-date>1090220400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC seismologist Karen McNally...</display-name><path>/2004/07/527</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/527</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338053301</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338053301</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Karen McNally, professor emerita of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received the University Medal from the National University of Costa Rica. McNally was honored in a ceremony on July 2 for her contributions in helping to establish a modern geophysical observatory in Costa Rica--the Observatorio Vulcanológico y Sismológico de Costa Rica, Universidad Nacional (OVSICORI-UNA)--and in developing the country's program for the reduction of earthquake hazards. </p><p>Costa Rica is one of the most earthquake-prone and volcanically active countries in the world. Yet there was no ongoing nationwide monitoring of seismic activity in Costa Rica until McNally helped establish a national seismographic network in 1984. McNally led a team of UCSC and Costa Rican scientists that set up the network with funding from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the U.S. Agency for International Development. She invited James Gill and Eli Silver, both professors of Earth sciences at UCSC, to join the project. </p><p>McNally also played a pivotal role in the establishment of OVSICORI, which now operates the seismographic network of 25 stations covering the entire country and transmitting continuously to the headquarters at the National University in Heredia. The monitoring and research conducted at the observatory has greatly advanced scientists' understanding of earthquakes and volcanoes in Costa Rica, while also helping the Costa Rican government develop programs to reduce the hazards of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. </p><p>UCSC faculty continue to maintain active collaborations with researchers at OVSICORI, several of whom received their Ph.D. degrees from UCSC's Department of Earth Sciences. </p><p>"Our level of knowledge about active earthquake zones in Costa Rica has escalated tremendously since the seismographic network was established," said Susan Schwartz, professor of Earth sciences and director of UCSC's W. M. Keck Seismological Laboratory. Schwartz has done extensive research in Costa Rica in collaboration with OVSICORI scientists. </p><p>Costa Rica is flanked by active tectonic margins on both the Pacific and Caribbean sides of the country. Many earthquakes originate on the Pacific side along the Middle America Trench, where the Cocos Plate dives beneath Central America. In 1991, however, the region was struck by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Caribbean coast, where a major thrust fault arcs beneath the Caribbean Sea. Costa Rica is also home to seven of Central America's 42 active volcanoes, including one of the longest continually erupting volcanoes on Earth (Arenal). </p><p>McNally's research in seismology has focused on earthquake mechanisms and risk assessment. A leading authority in these areas, she worked with the late Charles F. Richter at the California Institute of Technology before joining the UCSC faculty in 1981. At UCSC, McNally directed the Charles F. Richter Seismological Laboratory and founded the Institute of Tectonics. She also served on the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, which advises the governor's office and the Office of Emergency Services. </p><p>McNally is the second recipient of the "Medalla Universidad Nacional" award, a distinction given by the National University of Costa Rica "in exceptional cases to persons or institutions of national or international origin whose contributions in the social, humanitarian, scientific, artistic, and cultural areas have given exemplary inspiration in the construction of a more humane and complete society, inspired in the highest values of a culture filled with peace, justice, and well being."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ddea28072704601a012ff553a97b3"><name>528</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz acting chancellor leads $1.5 million federal study of math, science programs&#13;

Chemers. It is funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a component of the National Institutes of Health. </p><p>	The scope of need is staggering: The National Science Board estimates the United States will need to prepare 1.9 million workers in the sciences over the next 10 years. In 1998, only 37 percent of undergraduate degrees in science, math, and engineering went to women, and a paltry 12 percent were awarded to underrepresented minorities, including African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. The project is part of a larger NIH initiative aimed at understanding the efficacy of educational interventions to promote entry of minority students into careers in biomedical and behavioral research.</p><p>UC Santa Cruz has a long history of sponsoring academic outreach and support programs, and has been a leader in developing programs that encourage students to specialize in math, science, and engineering. University faculty play a vital role in these programs, working with students individually and in groups to help them develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for success in science. Part of the NIH study will involve assessing students before and after they participate in such programs to hone in on the elements that give students--from high school through graduate study--the greatest boost. </p><p>"We need to identify what works in two areas: improving student skills and inspiring them to stay in the fields of math, science, and engineering," said Chemers, a professor of psychology who specializes in leadership and organizational psychology. "We want to weigh the benefits of different program elements, like laboratory internships and faculty mentoring, so we can put our resources where they'll make the biggest difference."</p><p>The study will focus on the impact of research and mentoring opportunities on students, looking specifically at the process through which such experiences influence student skills in scientific inquiry and teamwork, their beliefs in their abilities, and their educational and career choices.</p><p>Although this project focuses on programs that direct students toward biomedical research careers, Chemers expects the results to be of broad value.</p><p>"We're studying programs to bring minorities and women into biomedical research careers, but in the process, we'll be learning a lot about what helps bring outsiders into the fold, and how best to support their leadership aspirations and teamwork," said Chemers. "Our hypothesis is that all students who participate in research and mentoring programs benefit, although we expect to find that those opportunities are particularly important for minorities."</p><p>An active researcher and a recognized expert on the cross-cultural and socio-psychological aspects of leadership, Chemers specializes in the role of self-confidence and optimism in leadership. His work suggests that belief in one's own abilities, or self-efficacy, is a strong predictor of motivation, persistence, resilience, and success. Chemers suspects that self-efficacy mediates, to some extent, the ultimate impact these programs have on participants.</p><p>"Federal support for the project is particularly welcome in the midst of California's budget crisis, during which the university has made painful cuts to successful outreach programs," said Carrol Moran, executive director of UCSC's Educational Partnership Center (EPC). In five years, the number of underrepresented UC students coming from EPC's six partnership schools has nearly doubled, said Moran. "We know our programs help students get excited and learn more about mathematics and science, but we haven't had the capacity to determine which elements of the program are the most effective," said Moran. "This is an in-depth study designed to find out what works and how."</p><p>Joining principal investigator Chemers and Moran on the UCSC research team will be mentoring expert Faye Crosby, a professor of psychology; project coordinator Barbara Goza, director of research and evaluation at EPC; Lisa Hunter, associate director for education and human resources at UCSC's Center for Adaptive Optics; Jerome Shaw, assistant professor of education and a science inquiry expert; and Eileen Zurbriggen, assistant professor of psychology and a statistician. Independent researchers Deborah Kogan and Julie Shattuck are serving as program consultants. </p><p>In the first phase of the project, a survey of alumni of various formal support programs will evaluate the impact of those initiatives. Included in the study will be 700 high school students, 500 undergraduates, and 100 graduate students. Those results will be compared to survey data gathered from 500 undergraduate and 100 graduate-level science students who did not participate in such programs. </p><p>The research team will also gather qualitative information from program administrators and field observations before moving into the second phase, during which current program participants will be studied. The first group will consist of 280 high school students participating in UC's COSMOS program for high-achieving math and science students, whose science skills and educational goals will be assessed before and after they attend a four-week residential program at UCSC. In the second group, 100 undergraduates involved in science support programs at UCSC will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the 2006-07 academic year.</p><p>A long-term goal of the project will be to incorporate the most effective elements into the university's classes so all students will benefit, said project coordinator Goza. "The majority of students who come to the university to study science don't stick with it, yet we hear all the time that employers aren't satisfied with the quality of the American workforce," she said. "We have to do a better job of keeping people in math and the sciences."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914de0188072704601a012ff619e70f4"><name>529</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Emerita psychology professor contributes major planned gift to support history research at UC Santa Cruz library</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Melanie J.

Mayer has established a $150,000 endowment to benefit history research in Special Collections at the UC Santa Cruz Library. The donation is one of the largest planned gifts in the history of the University Library.</p><p>The endowment was created in honor of Mayer's parents, who inspired her appreciation of books and libraries and their enduring importance to research and scholarship. It was also established to commemorate Mayer's own lifelong involvement with UC Santa Cruz, where she served with distinction as a professor of experimental psychology, specializing in the emerging field of vision research, from 1972 until her retirement in 1995. </p><p>Since the mid-1980s, Mayer has also been conducting research in western and women's history. She is the author of two books focusing on the influence of women in developing the Yukon and Klondike areas of the American/Canadian Northwest--for which she depended heavily on original source material assembled by special collections departments in libraries throughout the U.S. and Canada. </p><p>"I use the library all the time in different areas of research," Mayer noted. "Especially as I got into writing about history, I began to greatly appreciate the role of materials found in special collections that would be unavailable any other way. They're not printed materials usually, but rather things like diaries, photographs, unpublished manuscripts, and interviews that are preserved, organized, and made available to researchers and the general public only through special collections."</p><p>Mayer said she established the Edward J. and T. Jewel Bond Mayer Special Collections Endowment at UC Santa Cruz in her parents' name because they gave her encouragement and a solid foundation for becoming an academic scholar. </p><p>"I have these great memories as a child of being taken to Lane Public Library in Hamilton, Ohio," Mayer recalled. "My mother would make a real effort to get me to the library regularly, so I had a constant cycle of books when I was very young-even in the first and second grade. The library became a special place for me, and my parents too."</p><p>Mayer received her B.A. in chemistry from Cornell in 1967, and a Ph.D. in experimental psychology from UC San Diego in 1973. During her 23 years of teaching at UC Santa Cruz, she did extensive research in psychology, psychobiology, and sensory perception. Mayer's final projects before retirement focused on age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of blindness in the U.S. Her most recent book, <I>Staking Her Claim: The Life of Belinda Mulrooney, Klondike and Alaska Entrepreneur</I>, was published in 2000 by Ohio University Press. </p><p>Mayer said her gift is designed to support Special Collections at UC Santa Cruz with a special emphasis placed on obtaining resources needed for historical research-including photographs and collections related to western, women's, and local history. Income from the endowment will also be used to enhance archival methods of preservation, as well as to improve accessibility to the collections when a planned library expansion project is completed in the near future.</p><p>"The library is going to build a whole new area for Special Collections," Mayer said. "People will first walk into a main research room that will be named in honor of my parents, and it will have a reference librarian who will help visitors access materials. The endowment will help provide whatever is needed to increase the accessibility of the collections for the general public, as well as researchers."</p><p>"It isn't just academic," Mayer added. "In Santa Cruz, people often come up to the library to research materials about their family history, or to find out about the history of their property. I've looked at early photos of the section of town where I live and actually found photos of my own house being built in 1890. It's really a wonderful resource for everyone."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914de16c8072704601a012ff79549d6c"><name>530</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New elephant seal sculpture at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center honors Long Marine Lab volunteers</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1090566000000</start-date><display-name>New elephant seal sculpture...</display-name><path>/2004/07/530</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/530</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338054457</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338054457</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A dramatic new sculpture of northern elephant seals enlivens the entrance to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center in Santa Cruz and has already become a favorite "photo opportunity" for visitors to the center, located at UC Santa Cruz's Long Marine Laboratory. The exhibit honors the many volunteers who have helped over the years to interpret Long Marine Lab's scientific research for the public and highlights the long history of elephant seal research at the lab.</p><p>The life-size sculpture includes a female with her pup and a rearing bull elephant seal. It was unveiled at the Seymour Center's Volunteer Celebration in June and dedicated to "the Long Marine Laboratory Volunteers--Past, Present, and Future."</p><p>The idea of putting some kind of sculpture near the entrance was part of the original plans for the Seymour Center's exhibits, said director Julie Barrett Heffington.</p><p>"As our plans developed, it became clear that this was an obvious place to make a tribute to the volunteers who do so much to help us share the wonders of marine science with the public," Heffington said. </p><p>Since the founding of Long Marine Laboratory in 1978 as a research facility of the University of California, Santa Cruz, volunteers have been at the heart of the lab's public education programs. Those programs are now based at the Seymour Center, which opened in 2000. </p><p>Among the discoveries by UCSC scientists that the volunteers have helped share with the world are the amazing feats of the northern elephant seal (<I>Mirounga angustirostris</I>). The seals, which reproduce on the beaches of Año Nuevo State Reserve 20 miles north of Santa Cruz, have been a focus of research at UCSC for more than three decades. Long Marine Lab scientists discovered many of the remarkable diving, feeding, and reproductive behaviors of this impressive animal. With satellite tracking technology and other new tools, scientists at the lab are now unveiling the mysteries of elephant seal behavior during the long periods the animals spend at sea.</p><p>The elephant seal sculptures were made from molds originally created in the late 1980s by the California Academy of Sciences. The academy agreed to let Long Marine Lab borrow the molds, and the new sculptures were fabricated by David Caldwell at Edge Innovations in Alameda. Edge Innovations is known for producing lifelike animatronic creatures and other special effects for feature films, including the movies Free Willy, Anaconda, and The Perfect Storm.</p><p>Steve Davenport, manager of Long Marine Lab and assistant director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, credited both Caldwell and the original artists who created the molds for producing a superb display that captures the striking appearance of elephant seals. </p><p>"David Caldwell did a wonderful job, and it's all based on the incredible artwork of the originals," Davenport said.</p><p>One of the original artists, Gloria Nusse, worked with Caldwell on the final details. Nusse was one of a team of artists who sculpted the originals out of clay (about 1,000 pounds of it) and made latex molds from the clay sculptures. The other artists involved were Steve Carr, Lindsay Dixon, Jane Eckenrode, and Frank Tose. They were advised by elephant seal experts at the academy and even spent four days on Año Nuevo Island as guests of UCSC biologists, drawing and observing the seals, Nusse said.</p><p>"Working on the seals was a wonderful blending of art and science that does not happen all the time," she said.</p><p>Caldwell used the academy's molds to make the Seymour Center's sculptures out of fiberglass and polyester resin. The sculptures are filled with rigid foam and anchored to cement bulkheads in the ground. </p><p>The original sculptures include two bull elephant seals in a fighting pose, along with a mother and pup, but the mold for one of the bulls was damaged and could not be used. The originals have been on display for years at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. With those facilities undergoing a major rebuilding project, the academy is making arrangements to find a temporary home for its elephant seal sculptures, which are not among the exhibits in the academy's temporary museum at 875 Howard Street in San Francisco.</p><p>The Seymour Center is a science education center located at Long Marine Laboratory at the end of Delaware Ave. on the west side of Santa Cruz. Overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the center features aquariums, exhibits, touch tanks, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, a gift and book shop, and more. The center's exhibits focus on the work of researchers at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, which operates Long Marine Lab. Interactive stations provide hands-on learning experiences, and trained docents lead tours and answer questions. Tours of Long Marine Lab are offered from 1 to 3 p.m. daily (last tour ends at 4 p.m.). </p><p>The Seymour Center is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. It is closed Monday. Admission is $5 for adults; $3 for seniors, students, and youths (ages 6 to 16); and free for children ages 5 and under. Admission is free the first Tuesday of each month.</p><p>____________</p><p>Photos can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914de3118072704601a012ff14e45ef8"><name>531</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Emphasis on 'culture' in psychology fuels stereotypes, scholar says</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu </author><keywords>Per Gjerde, Human Development</keywords><start-date>1090825200000</start-date><display-name>Emphasis on 'culture' in...</display-name><path>/2004/07/531</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/531</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338054870</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338054870</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In the current issue of the influential journal <I>Human Development</I>, a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, challenges his colleagues to reconsider popular ideas about the role of culture in human development. </p><p>Contemporary scholarship is rife with broad, distorted generalizations about "culture" that play into stereotypes and threaten to obscure the powerful influences that individuality, resistance, and power play in development, said psychology professor Per Gjerde, who contributed the invited lead article to the journal's issue focused on "The Study of Diversity: Human Development in Culture."</p><p>"Psychologists often speak about the power of culture as an independent variable, but they fail to pay attention to the power structures that frame culture," said Gjerde. "Class differences are typically neglected and the perspective of subordinate groups is therefore overlooked."</p><p>Much of the trouble stems from the use of nations as proxies for cultural units, said Gjerde. Notions of culture are linked to national boundaries and geographical areas, like "East" and "West," fueling generalizations about "American individualism" and "Asian collectivism," said Gjerde.</p><p>Despite the permeability of borders and the pace of globalization, many scholars in psychology assign groups different styles of cognition and even personality traits, and references to "Easterners" and "Westerners" are common in scholarly and popular literature, observed Gjerde. </p><p>Although nations function as "powerful identity symbols," Gjerde calls for the study of human diversity and complexity in a manner that values individuality and the ability to transcend one's culture.</p><p> "The emphasis on diversity is welcome, but people are not exchangeable carbon copies," he said. "It is counterproductive to generalize about human development across nations and continents. If you don't take the individual into account, you run the risk--paradoxically--of creating a new set of stereotypes."</p><p>Confusing culture and nationality also obscures important racial and ethnic differences. "To equate the Chinese with the Han people marginalizes approximately 100 million people, and to speak about 'Japanese culture' obscures the fact that Japan is a multiethnic society," said Gjerde. "It fails to give voice to ethnic and other oppressed groups within Japan."</p><p>Born in Norway and married to a Japanese woman, Gjerde has studied human development in Japan, Thailand, and the United States. Much of contemporary scholarship about culture in psychology is ahistorical and insufficiently interdisciplinary to advance understanding of the human experience, he said. </p><p>"I have been bothered by these broad generalizations for some time, but they are catching on," he said. "I am afraid this approach is promoting a disregard for heterogeneity and is minimizing the role of the individual."</p><p>Gjerde is critical of the fieldwork that forms the basis for most notions of culture, saying it has been conducted in "limited and bounded social contexts" and that the fixation on groups has obscured the exploration of variation and complexity within and between human beings. </p><p>	But the dualistic, or "us-them," view of the world has received powerful endorsements, sometimes in the form of research funds from influential organizations.</p><p>"People want to generalize because it makes it easier to understand the world, so they come up with cultural labels like collectivist and individualist, which give us an illusion that the world is easily understandable," said Gjerde. "But these ideas have amazing staying power."</p><p>	Writing that "different social regularities indubitably exist," Gjerde emphasizes the difficulty of interpreting the meaning of such differences. Describing street scenes in Bangkok and Tokyo, he says people in Bangkok look and smile at others much more often than in Tokyo, where eye contact is generally avoided among strangers. Concluding, however, that Japanese are shyer than Thai would be "inane."</p><p>	 Gjerde recommends shifting the focus from groups to individuals and mapping the areas where human experience overlaps, and where it does not. Through observation, in-depth interviews, and the study of variability within groups, Gjerde believes researchers could learn about things like degrees of interdependence, which would be more credible and of greater value than sweeping statements about group differences.</p><p>Gjerde's model would take a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of culture, incorporating the writings of anthropology and other fields, and it would consider the influence of power, coercion, and class differences on individual psychological development. He also questions the premise that culture is passed on in a straightforward and passive manner from adults to children. "The assumption is that children acquire skills, values, and behaviors by participating in the adult world, but children today are not passive receptors," he said. "Their resistance to dominant adult cultural practices is a crucial--but often overlooked--component of their experience. It is noteworthy that most cultural psychologists shy away from studying conflict, resistance, and disharmony."</p><p>"Culture as ideology is relevant in the study of human development, but the question is how strong and how uniform that influence is, especially in this era of globalization when we're subject to a multitude of influences," said Gjerde. "Culture has a place, but it also has to be put in its place."</p><p>_____________</p><p>Editor's Note: Per Gjerde may be reached  at (831) 459-3148 or via e-mail at gjerde@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914de4cb8072704601a012ff416ef7b3"><name>532</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC scientist Jonathan Zehr receives major award from Moore Foundation for marine microbiology research</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Jonathan Zehr, Marine Microbiology </keywords><start-date>1090825200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC scientist Jonathan Zehr...</display-name><path>/2004/07/532</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/532</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338055324</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338055324</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has selected Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to receive more than $4 million over the next five years as a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Investigator in marine science. The award will support Zehr's groundbreaking research on microorganisms that "fertilize" the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use (a process called nitrogen fixation). </p><p>The funding for Zehr and a handful of other investigators is part of a 10-year, $145 million Marine Microbiology initiative launched by the Moore Foundation this year. Marine microbiology (sometimes called microbial oceanography) is a rapidly expanding field that is commanding increasing attention as scientists learn more about marine microorganisms and the ways in which they influence the global environment. </p><p>Zehr's discovery of nitrogen fixation by certain kinds of marine microbes, for example, has implications for everything from the ecology of the open ocean to global warming. Because nitrogen is one of life's essential nutrients, nitrogen fixation helps determine how productive ocean waters can be. And because nitrogen stimulates the growth of marine algae, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, nitrogen fixation is an important factor in determining how the ocean regulates and responds to global warming. </p><p>The new grant from the Moore Foundation will enable Zehr to increase his research efforts in this area. </p><p>"This is a particularly interesting area of research for me, and it has spawned a lot of general interest among other scientists because of its broad implications," Zehr said. </p><p>He added that the award will relieve him from the need to write grant proposals and allow him to focus more on his research activitites. "It's certainly going to change my life for awhile," he said.</p><p>In a study published in the journal <I>Nature</I> in 2001, Zehr and his colleagues used molecular screening techniques to identify several strains of single-celled organisms called cyanobacteria that are active nitrogen fixers. These microbes, isolated from a monitoring site in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii, are abundant enough throughout the world's oceans that they may account for as much nitrogen fixation as all previously known nitrogen-fixers. Zehr said he suspects there are even more nitrogen-fixers waiting to be found in the open ocean. </p><p>Zehr has plans to use new approaches, including genomics and remote sensing technology, to gain more insights into microbial processes in the open ocean. The introduction of new instrumentation and powerful new molecular techniques has been an important factor behind the growing interest in marine microbiology, he said. </p><p>"We have already learned a lot about marine microorganisms from genomics, and it has become a very high profile area of research. I expect to see general interest in this area continuing to grow as more discoveries are made," Zehr said.</p><p>One of Zehr's collaborators, David Karl of the University of Hawaii, has also been selected as a Moore Foundation Investigator, along with two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Sallie Chisholm and Edward DeLong (who recently moved to MIT from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute). </p><p>David Kingsbury, director of marine science at the Moore Foundation, said that it was the foundation's goal to not only support the top scientists in marine microbiology, but to stimulate close collaborations between these scientists to even further accelerate progress in this key area of ocean research.</p><p>In addition to supporting these individual investigators, the Moore Foundation has provided a grant to the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives to support a marine microbial sampling expedition in the Atlantic Ocean. The institute, headed by genome sequencing pioneer Craig Venter, is using techniques developed for sequencing the human genome to explore microbial diversity in the oceans.</p><p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation launched its 10-year Marine Microbiology initiative in April 2004, with the goal of attaining new knowledge regarding the composition, function, and ecological role of microbial communities in the world's oceans. Funding strategies include supporting Moore Foundation Investigators, linking scientists in related fields, establishing intern programs, and supporting select research projects that will affect ocean science as a whole.</p><p>The foundation was established in November 2000 by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore and his wife Betty to create positive outcomes for future generations. The foundation funds outcome-based grants and initiatives to achieve significant and measurable results. Grant making supports the foundation's principal areas of concern: environmental conservation, science, higher education, and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>____________</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Zehr at (831) 459-4009 or zehrj@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d8fb08072704601a012ff522d36ea"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626391929</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626391929</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d8fb08072704601a012ff522d36ea"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/07/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626391929</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626391929</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
