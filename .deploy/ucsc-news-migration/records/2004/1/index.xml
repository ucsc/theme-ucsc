The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>"We felt as though we really needed to have someone special for the 20th anniversary," said John Holloway, executive director of Student Life and a member of the selection committee. While the event has featured many outstanding speakers over the years, Holloway said, bringing Yolanda King to Santa Cruz will be especially meaningful because of her memories of her father. "We hope this choice will really resonate with people. I'm very excited about the selection."</p><p>It was just two weeks after Yolanda King was born in 1955 that Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person on the bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The arrest of Parks prompted a bus boycott--led by then-Montgomery minister Martin Luther King--and is considered a pivotal event in the movement that ultimately desegregated the South. Tensions ran high at the time, and Yolanda was at home when a bomb landed on the porch of the Kings' house in early 1956. No one was injured. </p><p>Years later, Yolanda King portrayed Rosa Parks in the NBC-TV film King, with Paul Winfield and Howard Rollins, one of her many film and television roles blending her interest in acting with her support for human rights. Her film credits also include playing Betty Shabazz, wife of Malcolm X, in the film Death of A Prophet with Morgan Freeman, and Reena Evers in Ghosts of Mississippi.</p><p>Yolanda King's approach to social change is reminiscent of her father's. "While it is imperative to actively challenge the forces that deny human beings their right to a decent life.one must also stimulate and alter the hearts and minds of both the privileged as well as those who have been too long denied," she says on her web site. "Within the arts lies this power."</p><p>Yolanda King is coeditor with Elodia Tate of a new book, Open My Eyes, Open My Soul: Celebrating Our Common Humanity. The book includes a foreword by her mother, Coretta Scott King, and is a collection of stories and poems by celebrities, human rights advocates, and writers from all walks of life, including Maya Angelou, Stevie Wonder, Robert Kennedy Jr., and Muhammad Ali. Yolanda King said its release, scheduled to coincide with Martin Luther King's birthday on January 15, is designed to celebrate the beauty of diversity and encourage a more compassionate world.</p><p>Yolanda King has been involved in a range of theater projects, including serving for 12 years as co-founding director of the Nucleus theater group with Attallah Shabazz, the eldest child of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz. Nucleus toured schools, colleges, churches, and communities around the country with an original production called Stepping Into Tomorrow.</p><p>In 1990, Yolanda King formed Higher Ground Productions. Its first project was a multimedia theatrical production celebrating her father. Her one-woman show--featuring her portrayal of 16 characters--toured the country for four years. Higher Ground Productions' most recent project, Achieving The Dream, premiered during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, and recently received eight NAACP Theater Award nominations. It is currently being performed around the country. </p><p>King, who received a bachelor's degree in theater and African American studies from Smith College, and a master's degree in theater from New York University, has also been a visiting professor in theater at Fordham University in New York.</p><p>Yolanda King serves on the Board of Directors of The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and was the founding director of the King Center's cultural affairs program. She is a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Partnership Council of Habitat for Humanity, a sponsor of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and holds a lifetime membership in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d571d8072704601a012ff893da7ba"><name>438</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC offers new degree in applied physics</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1073545200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC offers new degree...</display-name><path>/2004/01/438</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/01/438</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338019033</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338019033</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is offering a new major leading to a B.S. degree in applied physics, designed to prepare students for careers in industry. The other option offered for undergraduates by the Department of Physics is a physics degree that focuses on preparing students for graduate study in physics. </p><p>The department created the applied physics option because most physics students end up making their careers in applied areas, said David Dorfan, professor and chair of physics. </p><p>"This program will provide outstanding preparation for students wishing to obtain a broad scientific background for entering a fast-changing technological environment," Dorfan said.</p><p>According to statistics from the American Institute of Physics, about 70 percent of graduates with bachelor's degrees in physics are employed in industry. Dorfan estimated that about half of the students who graduate from UCSC with bachelor's degrees in physics go directly to work for technology companies. Others may go on to earn a master's degree in engineering. And even among those who pursue graduate degrees in physics, most eventually work in industry, he said.</p><p>The new applied physics major differs from the physics major in some of its requirements, such as courses in computer science and chemistry. It also offers students greater flexibility to take courses in applied areas of interest. In addition to applied physics courses offered by the Physics Department, courses in engineering, chemistry, and biology can fulfill the major's elective requirements. </p><p>The Physics Department has begun admitting students to the new major this quarter.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d58d88072704601a012fff8e79e65"><name>439</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz to present 2004 'Thinking at the Edge' Distinguished Lecture Series</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1073545200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz to...</display-name><path>/2004/01/439</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/01/439</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338019485</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338019485</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Internationally renowned AIDS researcher Robert Gallo, award-winning social psychologist Elliot Aronson, and UC Berkeley astronomy professor and planet hunter Geoffrey Marcy are just a few of the diverse array of speakers set to appear at UC Santa Cruz in the coming year. </p><p>It's all part of UCSC's 2004 "Thinking at the Edge" Distinguished Lecture Series, which kicks off on January 20 with a presentation by actress and producer Yolanda King, the daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. All of the lectures are free and open to the public.</p><p>Since the founding of the campus in 1965, UCSC's academic divisions and departments have presented hundreds of special lecture events that have been primarily attended by members of the campus community.

Dedicated to finding alternatives to mainstream architectural practice, the Ant Farm combined video, performance, and sculpture--achieving widespread notoriety in the mid '70s for such projects as the Cadillac Ranch public art installation in Texas, and the spectacular performance art event Media Burn.</p>
<p>The first major exhibition to explore the history of this influential, renegade collective will be presented at the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive from January 21 through April 26. Ant Farm 1968-1978 will feature more than 200 objects, including photographs, drawings, collages, videotapes, documentary materials, and a re-creation of an inflatable structure built by the visionary art group.</p>
<p>"It was a very different time," Lord recalled. "I graduated from Tulane School of Architecture in 1968 and there was revolution in the air. There was the Vietnam War, student protests, student unrest.we didn't want to go into the corporate architectural world at all, and that was our motivation for starting the Ant Farm."</p>
<p>Inspired by such creative thinkers as Buckminster Fuller and Paulo Soleri, the Ant Farm collective spent its early years creating an alternative architecture designed for a nomadic lifestyle. They build giant inflatable structures--cheap and easy to assemble--in opposition to the mainstream Brutalist architecture of the '60s that emphasized permanent reinforced concrete. This led to The Truckstop Network, a freewheeling 1970 tour of colleges and universities in the Ant Farm's "Media Van," which was equipped with a video portapack, as well as an Eisenhower-era trailer, complete with an inflatable solar-heated shower unit. "We brought an interest in high technology to the nomadic counterculture," Lord observed.</p>
<p>The Ant Farm completed a number of successful architectural commissions in the early '70s, including the award-winning House of the Century in Angleton, Texas. But the collective also spent time exploring the potential power of video and performance art. This culminated in Media Burn, a dazzling event (captured on a widely distributed videotape) that featured two collective members dressed like astronauts, who drove a customized 1959 Cadillac El Dorado--outfitted with interior video communication--at full-speed through a pyramid of flaming TVs in the parking lot of San Francisco's Cow Palace on July 4, 1975.</p>

<p>But perhaps the Ant Farm's most famous endeavor was Cadillac Ranch, the art installation along Route 66 (now Highway 40) in Amarillo, Texas, that was immortalized in song by Bruce Springsteen. Commissioned by Stanley Marsh 3, Lord and his Ant Farm partners, Michels and Hudson Marquez, partially buried 10 Cadillacs nose down in a wheat field--both celebrating the evolution of the Cadillac's tailfin and at the same time mocking Detroit carmakers' history of planned obsolescence.</p>
<p>"Cadillac was the ultimate status symbol in America at that time," Lord noted. It took four weeks to find all the cars--some came from junkyards, a few came from used-car lots. But it took less than five days to bury them."</p>
<p>Within six to eight months, images of Cadillac Ranch had appeared in People and Esquire magazines. Soon, articles began popping up everywhere and people began to make pilgrimages, often scratching their names in the paint of one of the cars. Over the past two decades, the image of Cadillac Ranch has been used--with or without permission--by dozens of companies advertising everything from automobiles and insurance to restaurants and computers. Possibly the best-known public artwork in the country, Cadillac Ranch is seen by an estimated 280,000 people each year as they motor down the Texas highway.</p>
<p>Lord has been working for the past two years on a compilation DVD of Ant Farm material to be distributed nationally. Partially funded by UC Santa Cruz research funds, the DVD is scheduled to be released on February 1 and will be distributed by Facets Multi-Media. (<a href="http://www.facets.org">www.facets.org</a>). Lord noted that it would include Springsteen's celebratory song, "Cadillac Ranch."</p>
<p>"After Springsteen wrote the song, his record company called and wanted to use a photo of Cadillac Ranch in the liner notes for his album The River," Lord said. "We ended up giving them a photo for a very modest fee. So I recently wrote a letter to his manager asking for permission to use the song in the DVD, and they gave it to us."</p>
<p>When a fire in their San Francisco studio destroyed much of their work, the Ant Farm disbanded in 1978. Lord eventually moved on to become an assistant professor of visual art at UC San Diego. He came to UC Santa Cruz in 1988 and is now chair of the Film and Digital Media Department.</p>
<p>"It was a hard transition for me after the Ant Farm ended," Lord noted. "But I liked being in an environment of creative collaboration, so teaching appealed to me. The Ant Farm was my graduate education--my M.F.A. equivalency was established through life experience," he added.</p>

"If we can create a learning environment in classrooms that requires students to cooperate and share their knowledge with one another, we help them break down prejudices and build a stronger sense of community and support."</p><p>	Aronson, a popular teacher, was the first recipient of the UCSC Alumni Association's  Distinguished Teaching Award. He will discuss ways to foster cooperative learning at both the elementary and high school levels, and he will share research that shows the benefits of reducing competition in the classroom.</p><p>	"By working closely with one another in a cooperative way, students begin to see positive qualities in their classmates that they hadn't seen before," said Aronson.</p><p>	Ranked among the top 100 psychologists of the 20th century, Aronson is known for his work on real-world problems and for his commitment to making his research findings accessible to the public. He has made major contributions to the theory of cognitive dissonance as well as to the understanding of interpersonal attraction, prejudice, energy conservation, and AIDS prevention. His book The Social Animal remains among the most popular texts in social psychology.</p><p>	Aronson, who retired from UCSC in 1994, teaches social psychology at Stanford.

<p>The Sixth National New Teacher Center Symposium on Teacher Induction, "<a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org/TrainAnnual.shtml">Soaring to New Heights</a>," will focus on three themes central to teacher induction: quality mentoring, teacher leadership, and equitable learning and social justice for all students.</p>
<p>With participants coming from 29 states, as well as England and Canada, the symposium has become one of the most popular gatherings of its kind. More than 60 sessions will highlight effective strategies, innovative ways of viewing traditional issues, and research that substantiates, promotes, and advances the work of teacher development and induction.</p>
<p>"We need to get the word out about what teachers need to be successful in their first years in the classroom, because we know that those first years are critical to their long-term success," said Ellen Moir, director of the <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org/">New Teacher Center</a>. "By strengthening the teaching profession, we help every student."</p>
<p>Based at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the New Teacher Center (NTC) has pioneered the development of a mentor-based support program and is building a network of educators who are implementing it in school districts around the country. Active in schools throughout California and in 21 other states, the NTC has a strong track record of helping, retaining, and nurturing novice teachers.</p>
<p>"Half of all new teachers leave the profession within their first five years of service, but by pairing new teachers with veteran mentors who give them the support and encouragement they need, we can reverse this long-standing trend," said Moir. "Mentorship makes all the difference, and we're seeing school districts embrace our model regardless of mandates and budget problems, because it works."</p>
<p>Ninety-four percent of new teachers who participated in 1992 in the NTC's Santa Cruz New Teacher Project were still teachers or working in administration six years later, said Moir. The New Teacher Project is one of California's 150 beginning teacher support and assessment programs.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we know that students with the greatest needs are most likely to be taught by underprepared teachers," said Moir. "Every student deserves a fully prepared teacher who has the backing of a team of experts who are ready and willing to share their knowledge. We are building the networks to tighten the safety net so all students and all teachers will achieve their full potential."</p>

Greenwood. "Tom Vani and his team have done a great service in advancing our campus priorities." Business and Administrative Services Vice Chancellor Vani led the negotiations to acquire the property.</p><p>Among the advantages cited for the property is its proximity to the various research facilities at Long Marine Laboratory and vicinity. Formerly used by Texas Instruments as a semiconductor wafer fabrication plant, the facilities include a total of approximately  242,000 gross (154,000 net) square feet, including a large "clean room," a specially designed computer area, extensive space that could be used for classrooms, laboratories, and offices, plus ample parking.</p><p> </p><p>"We have a tremendous demand for space on campus," said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Martin M. Chemers.  "Although we don't yet have detailed plans for this facility, it is clear that there is great potential for a range of uses, and we are developing a process for allocating this potential new space for highest priority needs."</p><p>The potential for partnerships between UC Santa Cruz and the City of Santa Cruz is another desirable feature of the property. Mayor Scott Kennedy stated, "We are pleased that Chancellor Greenwood has committed the University to work with us toward the goal of a "net win" for both the City and the University. Although UCSC's purchase of the Texas Instruments property results in direct loss, both immediately and on an ongoing basis, of the City's second largest property tax payer, UCSC and the City have agreed to an active partnership aimed at generating direct tax-revenue producing benefits for the City over the long term."</p><p>Although the terms are undisclosed, the purchase price is significantly less than the appraised value. "Texas Instruments has a long history of support for education, and this offer is another example of that commitment," Greenwood said. "We greatly appreciate the public spiritedness of TI in creating the generous terms of this contract."</p><p>Texas Instruments acquired the site in 1996, when it purchased Silicon Systems Incorporated (SSi). </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d63518072704601a012ff15e3b012"><name>446</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to hold public hearing on draft EIR for long-term development of Long Marine Laboratory, adjoining property</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495); jrburns@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1075446000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC to hold public...</display-name><path>/2004/01/446</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/01/446</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338022137</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338022137</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, will hold a public meeting on February 19 to receive comments on a draft Environmental Impact Report that has been prepared related to future development at Long Marine Laboratory and adjoining property.

The draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) examines the environmental effects of a Coastal Long Range Development Plan that UCSC has prepared for 98 acres known as the UCSC Marine Science Campus. The property includes the site of Long Marine Lab and 55 acres acquired by UCSC in 1999.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The Coastal Long Range Development Plan (CLRDP), guiding the property's physical development for the next 20 years, includes the construction of new buildings, roads, parking lots, public-access routes and overlooks, infrastructure systems, and short-term and overnight housing that will support the Marine Science Campus's programs. The CLRDP also describes the protection and enhancement of the site's natural resources.</p>
<p>In addition to examining the environmental effects of the CLRDP itself, the draft EIR considers the impacts of five near-term projects included within the long-range plan:</p>
<p>. phase two of the Center for Ocean Health project;</p>
<p>. the United States Geological Survey's Western Coastal and Marine Geology facility;</p>
<p>. the Sea Otter Research and Conservation Center;</p>
<p>. a Shared Campus Warehouse and Laydown Facility, which would provide space for workers to outfit and maintain research vessels, as well as storage space for boats;</p>
<p>. 42 apartment/townhouse units.</p>
<p>A UCSC planning committee, which includes representatives of the city of Santa Cruz and staff from the California Coastal Commission, has been working since fall 1999 to develop plans for the Marine Science Campus.</p>
<p>The university hired a consulting team--EHDD Architecture, a San Francisco firm that developed the original Long Marine Lab Master Plan over 20 years ago and also designed the Monterey Bay Aquarium; and BMS Design Group, also from San Francisco--to prepare the CLRDP for the site.</p>
<p>The following summarizes planning milestones for the project:</p>
<p>. December 1999--the committee adopted a set of planning principles for developing the site as a marine research and education center that were presented to the public at an open house.</p>
<p>. June 2000--At the second public meeting, the consultants and the planning committee presented the input they had received from the focus groups. In addition, consultants unveiled six different schematics, showing how the site might be developed as a marine research and education center.</p>
<p>. October 2000--At the third public meeting, three site concepts were presented and discussed.</p>
<p>. December 2000--The expansion of Long Marine Lab was discussed at a meeting of the Coastal Commission in San Francisco. Commissioners at that meeting asked UCSC staff and consultants to reexamine the boundaries of a seasonal pond and the drainage areas that make up the wetlands on the site.</p>
<p>. July 2001--The results of that wetlands review were discussed at a fourth workshop. A revised site plan was also presented, reflecting past discussions about incorporating research and educational facilities on the site, preserving open space on the site, and providing housing that would support the needs of the marine programs there.</p>
<p>. August 2002--A preliminary draft of the CLRDP was completed and discussed by UCSC staff and project consultants at a fifth public workshop.</p>
<p>The current CLRDP contains text and map changes that respond to comments made by reviewers of that earlier document. The CLRDP also incorporates the recently completed work that further delineates wetland and environmentally sensitive habitat areas for the Marine Science Campus.</p>
<p>The CLRDP and draft EIR are available for review at UCSC's McHenry and Science and Engineering Libraries and the main branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library. Paper copies may be purchased from Kinko's at 105 Laurel Street in Santa Cruz for the cost of duplication. CD copies are available free of charge from UCSC's Environmental Assessment Group (EAG) at 515 Swift Street in Santa Cruz. The CLRDP, the draft EIR, maps of the site, and additional information are also available online at: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ppc/planning/lml.html">www2.ucsc.edu/ppc/planning/lml.html</a>.</p>
<p>At the February 19 hearing, members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the draft EIR. Written comments may also be submitted during the comment period, which ends on March 19.

UCSC did twice that well, with a 30 percent increase over last year's total of 40 volunteers.</p><p>"UCSC is one of the few schools founded after the Peace Corps was already established," noted Dennis McMahon of the San Francisco office of the Peace Corps, "but it has certainly made up for lost time."</p><p>McMahon said that in his experience, UCSC students are very socially conscious and concerned about the world and how the United States represents itself to the world. "I think that concern breeds a strong impulse to want to do something about it, and the Peace Corps is one of the avenues for that."</p><p>For the tenth year in a row, the University of Wisconsin-Madison had the highest number of alumni serving as Peace Corps volunteers with 142 volunteers, up from 123 last year. Leading the way in the medium-size colleges and universities category, the University of Virginia held its top ranking for a second year, increasing its number of alumni volunteers serving from 68 to 75. In the small colleges and universities category, the University of Chicago moved from third to first place with 34 alumni serving, up from 24 last year. Schools are ranked according to the size of the student body. Small schools are those with less than 5,000 undergraduates, medium-size schools are those between 5,001 and 15,000 undergraduates, and large schools are those with more than 15,000 undergraduates. </p><p>Other UC campuses also were listed, in the large-college category. UC Berkeley ranked sixth, UC Santa Barbara was in a three-way tie for eighth, and UCLA was fifteenth. </p><p>There are currently 7,533 Peace Corps volunteers serving in the field, the highest level since 1974. Peace Corps volunteers must be U.S. citizens and at least 18 years of age. Peace Corps service is a two-year commitment.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d6c4f8072704601a012ff0114aa3b"><name>453</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Organic agriculture at a crossroads: Prof says goals of ecological sustainability and social justice may require subsidies</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1073890800000</start-date><display-name>Organic agriculture at a...</display-name><path>/2004/01/453</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/01/453</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338024476</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338024476</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Thirty years after the birth of organic agriculture in California, the industry looks more than ever like the agribusiness model it set out to oppose. The early dream of producing food in ecologically sustainable ways has withered under multiple pressures, but an analysis by a geographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, suggests that government subsidies would help restore the organic movement as a force for environmental and social transformation.</p>

"The organic industry in California has largely replicated what it set out to oppose," said Julie Guthman, assistant professor of community studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of the forthcoming book Agrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in California (Berkeley: UC Press, 2004).<br/>
<br/>
<p>Guthman will discuss her analysis during the 24th Annual Ecological Farming Conference January 21-24, the world's foremost sustainable agriculture conference, at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove. Guthman's workshop, entitled "Impacts and Implications of Concentration in the Organic Industry," is scheduled for Friday, January 23, at 10:30 a.m. Guthman, a faculty affiliate of the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, is part of a contingent of sustainable agriculture experts from UCSC who will be presenting during Eco-Farm; see below for descriptions of other presentations.</p>
<p>Corporate buyouts of smaller organic operations are a visible sign of change in the organic industry, but Guthman insists that the paradox of organic is much more complex than a story of "big versus small, or good guys versus bad guys. I call it a trilemma, because it's about what growers need, what consumers need, and what workers need."</p>
<p>California's large-scale, highly specialized form of commercial farming hinges on crop specialization and low-paid immigrant farm labor, said Guthman. Against that backdrop, and coupled with the organic movement's history of self-regulation and dependence on a price premium, engrained forces have undermined organic growers' ability to "do things in a very different way," said Guthman.</p>
<p>Among organic growers, too, there is diversity, with some embracing the "classic" model of organic farming that relies on crop rotations, diversification, composting, and biological pest control. But much of the organic acreage today meets only the minimum standards for organic production, she said.</p>
<p>"There's a widespread misconception that big corporate interests took over the organic industry, when in truth a lot of the growth has come from within," said Guthman. "Operations like Natural Selection/Earthbound Farm and Pavich Family Farms have recruited people from the conventional industry to grow for them, because they wanted more professionalism than what the visionaries of the 1970s were able to provide."</p>
<p>In addition, a lot of growth in the organic sector has been driven by farmers seeking higher profits. But incentives for all organic growers have eroded in the face of a shrinking price premium, and high land values have pushed just about everybody to farm in more intensive ways, said Guthman. As high-volume, lucrative crops like organic salad mix come to be dominated by a handful of players, margins are tightening and producers are also forsaking the vision of a more socially just production and distribution model.</p>
<p>Although consumers can now find organic salad mix at retailers like Trader Joe's and Costco, in what Guthman calls the "Wal-Martization" of salad mix, prices are typically set at the retail level and bear little relationship to what farmers receive.</p>
<p>"In this market, it's very difficult for the organic industry to escape the imperatives of intensification without a policy mechanism like subsidies," said Guthman. "The cost of growing in a more sustainable fashion cannot be entirely borne on the backs of farmers, workers, or consumers."</p>
