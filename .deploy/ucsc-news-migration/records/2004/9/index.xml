<p>The Grammy award-winning sextet, BeauSoleil-described by Prairie Home Companion's Garrison Keillor as "simply the best Cajun band in the world-will join forces with Louisiana's legendary Preservation Hall Jazz Band for a rollicking opening night double bill of New Orleans jazz, zydeco, country, and blues.</p>

"It should be an incredibly high-energy night," noted Arts &amp; Lectures director Michelle Witt, "with lots of dancing to some of the finest musicians around. It's really hard to beat a show that combines the best of New Orleans jazz with the country's most popular Cajun ensemble." <br/>
<br/>
<p>But that's only the beginning of a diverse series of 18 events ranging from classical and world music, to modern dance, spoken word, and theater. The season runs through May 5 at various venues throughout Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>"It's very much a mix of fine arts and popular culture," Witt observed. "We also try to combine mediums as much as possible; we often present a number of different styles in the same program."</p>

<p>Highlights of the 2004-05 season include appearances by three of the country's top dance companies. The mind-boggling Pilobolus Dance Theater will showcase a new commissioned work, Megawhat, along with the wildly imaginative and extremely athletic repertoire that has made this modern dance company so popular throughout the world.</p>
<p>Pioneering avant-garde choreographer Trisha Brown's dance company will also perform a newly commissioned work, Present Tense, set to John Cage's Pieces for Prepared Piano, as well as Set &amp; Reset with sets and score by renowned artist Robert Rauschenberg. And the always innovative dancer/illusionists of Momix Dance Theater will offer founder Moses Pendleton's Baseball-a multimedia tribute to America's national pastime featuring music by James Brown, Loreena McKennitt, and Ali Farka Toure-on the weekend prior to the opening of this year's baseball season.</p>
<p>A brilliant new solo show by HBO, Showtime, and Comedy Central veteran Marga Gomez; a lecture by Chuck D, cofounder of the legendary rap group Public Enemy and now host of a new morning show on Air America Radio; and a tribute to the late monologist Spalding Gray are just a few of the more unusual events slated for the coming months.</p>
<p>There is more, however, to UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures program than just a multitude of great shows.</p>
<p>"Nearly every artist who comes is doing some kind of educational outreach in the community," Witt noted. "This might involve offering master classes, conducting lecture/demonstrations, or holding open rehearsals with dance and theater companies."</p>

<p>Witt added that there will also be an opening night postconcert party for Gold Circle and Arts &amp; Lectures members-including food and wine with members of BeauSoleil and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band--as well as wine receptions for members during intermission at selected events throughout the season. In addition, question-and-answer sessions will be open to the entire audience after almost every show.</p>
<p>"We have really wonderful conversations between the performers and our audiences," she observed. "People always stay and get involved, and the artists love it."</p>

</table>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has awarded UCSC's Environmental Studies Department a $571,000 grant over four years to bolster scientific knowledge about organic systems and to strengthen the Central Coast network of organic farmers and agricultural researchers. The grant period begins September 15.<br/>
<br/>
<p>In collaboration with farmers, agroecology researchers at UCSC have pioneered organic production methods for strawberries and other important regional crops. This project will build on those successes and prepare the organic industry for continued rapid growth by developing baseline nutrient management tools and addressing stubborn challenges, such as soil pathogens and pest management.</p>
<p>"Conventional farmers have decades worth of research to draw on, while organic growers have very little scientific data to rely on," said environmental studies professor Carol Shennan, director of the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) and one of four UCSC leaders of the project. "Organic production is a complex system that integrates soil fertility, crop rotation, water management, and pest and disease control. It requires a systems approach, but agricultural research has historically tended to focus on narrow, single-issue problems."</p>
<p>The grant will fund a series of coordinated experiments at multiple locations designed to give farmers hands-on information. The results will be dispersed throughout the farming community with the help of organizations such as California Certified Organic Farmers, the Organic Farming Research Foundation, the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, and the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association. UCSC's research team will be made up of Shennan, environmental studies professor Stephen Gliessman, research associate Joji Muramoto, and entomologist Sean Swezey, who directs the UC Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program.</p>
<p>"Over the years, we've done research that farmers want, and they've had a role in directing it," said Gliessman, the Alfred E. Heller Professor of Agroecology. "Our job is to take their problems and do the research they need to solve those problems."</p>
<p>Gliessman recalls the skepticism that greeted early collaborations.</p>
<p>"When we started this work 17 years ago with Jim Cochran of Swanton Berry Farms, people said, 'You're crazy. You aren't going to grow strawberries organically.' Now, the USDA is saying, 'This is important. It has to be done.' It's the farmers who took the risk."</p>
<p>Cochran will be joined by other experienced organic growers who will participate in the study, including Daniel Schmida of Sandpiper Farms and Steve Pedersen of High Ground Organics. Landowner Robert Stephens has also set aside a portion of his acreage at Elkhorn Ranch for use in the study. In addition, research will be conducted on the 25-acre UCSC Farm. Representatives from UC Cooperative Extension offices in Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Benito, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties will participate, as well as a scientist from the USDA's Agricultural Research Station in Salinas and an agricultural economist from UC Davis.</p>
<p>The grant will enable researchers to take their work to a new level and test the limits of monoculture farming, said Gliessman. "We want to redesign the system to better resist disease," he said. "It may turn out to look very different from what we're used to. You probably won't see acre after acre of organic strawberries. You may see a patchwork of strawberries and other crops, because monoculture brings problems. We need to build on the strengths of diversity."</p>
<p>By conducting multiple replicated trials on organic farms, researchers will assess the effects of crop rotations and different fertility, disease, and pest management strategies on yields, soil quality, weeds, pests, and soil pathogens.</p>
<p>Experiments will focus on:</p>
<p>o Testing biological alternatives to methyl bromide to suppress Verticillium dahliae, a soil pathogen that poses the greatest threat for organic strawberry production in the state. Anaerobic decomposition of cover crop residues and biofumigation with Brassicas will be evaluated. Given the upcoming ban on methyl bromide, such experiments may be of value to conventional farmers, as well.</p>
<p>o Developing tools to help organic farmers monitor changes in soil nutrient levels, or "what goes in and what comes out," as Shennan put it. Researchers will analyze the nutrient value of soil amendments, including cover crops, commercial composts, and fish emulsion fertilizer, and document what nutrients are removed when the crop is harvested. They will also develop plant tissue nitrogen tests so farmers can assess how well their fertility management is working, said Shennan. Building a database of their findings will give farmers a powerful resource to draw on that will supplement their own soil tests, she said.</p>
<p>o Use of organic pest control to combat pests that prey on strawberries. Vacuum devices and an alfalfa trap crop will be tested against the western tarnished plant bug, and researchers will evaluate the movement and effectiveness of beneficial insects introduced into or near the trap crop vegetation. Researchers will also assess the value of native-plant hedgerows in attracting beneficial insects that prey on crop predators.</p>
<p>o Applicability of three models to simulate how management changes could impact crop harvests, soil nitrogen availability, and the movement of nutrients under a range of weather conditions and for different types of soils. If any model works well for predicting farming outcomes in this area, it could be used to help farmers make decisions about crop rotations, cover crop use, and management of fertility inputs, said Shennan.</p>
<p>The scope of the project reflects the importance of organic agriculture in the economy and UCSC's role supporting organic farmers, said Shennan. The Central Coast is well-known for its high concentration of organic farms, and many producers have benefitted from partnerships with UCSC researchers and UC Cooperative Extension specialists.</p>
<p>In Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties, more than $140 million, or 6 percent, of the region's $2 billion vegetable production in 2001 was certified organic, according to Shennan, and the two counties generated more than $400 million gross value in strawberries. The California organic agriculture industry has grown quickly, producing sales of $340 million in 2003, according to the California Department of Agriculture Organic Program. The state produces nearly half of the total organic vegetables certified in the United States; strawberries are the most lucrative organic commodity in the state on a per acre basis, valued at $17.5 million.</p>
<p>"Organic farmers face the same production challenges as conventional growers, but the research community has overlooked their needs," said Shennan. "With one of the oldest university-based organic research and training programs in the world and one of the pioneering academic programs in agroecology, UC Santa Cruz is in a good position to help fill in the gaps of scientific knowledge."</p>

But when it comes to field surveys that require identification of all the organisms that occur in a particular area, he defers to the biodiversity "SWAT team" he has assembled to conduct an unprecedented series of surveys of life on rocky shorelines along the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<p>"They have become without a doubt the best team of field evaluators around. They really know their stuff," Raimondi said.</p>
<p>Alison Kendall, Kristen Kusic, and Haven Livingston--all graduates of UC Santa Cruz--are currently the core members of the Intertidal SWAT Team, which began doing surveys in February 2001. They have now surveyed nearly 100 sites, from Baja California to Alaska, moving in at low tide to document the abundance and diversity of algae and invertebrates throughout the intertidal zone, an area of tidepools and rocky benches between the high- and low-tide marks.</p>
<p><strong>Biodiversity patterns</strong></p>
<p>The findings from this massive survey project have already revealed previously unrecognized geographic patterns of biodiversity along the Pacific coast. The surveys have also resulted in major extensions of the known ranges of several species. The team's plans are to resurvey the same sites every three to five years, and in the long run these surveys will enable scientists to detect significant ecological changes that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
<p>"There have been a lot of intertidal surveys over the years in certain places, but what really sets us apart is the geographic range that we have been able to cover," Kendall said.</p>
<p>Raimondi had been doing surveys of intertidal life in California since 1991, with funding from the federal Minerals Management Service to establish baseline monitoring data in case of an oil spill. Eventually, he decided that a more comprehensive approach was needed to reveal broad patterns of biodiversity along the West Coast, which had never been documented using a standardized approach. He realized that this would require a group of experts who could conduct rapid, intensive surveys using standardized procedures over a large geographic range.</p>
<p>"The idea was to put together a team that could come in and hit a site very quickly and intensively, and then move on. That's why we called it a SWAT team," Raimondi said.</p>
<p>Raimondi is a principal investigator in the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), a major collaborative project started in 1999 with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. PISCO researchers are focused on understanding the processes that drive the intertidal and subtidal ecosystems along the West Coast. Although biodiversity surveys were not initially a major focus for PISCO, the SWAT team's work is now a fundamental part of the project.</p>
<p>"It gives the context for almost everything else we do," Raimondi said. "What we were hoping to do was to discover broad patterns in the organization of these biological communities, and then see what causes those patterns and how they change. The surveys give us a basis from which to look for change, and they have allowed us to delineate important biogeographic regions along the coast."</p>
<p><strong>Essential information</strong></p>
<p>In addition, the surveys are providing essential information for the management of coastal resources, Raimondi said. "Informed management requires an understanding of biodiversity and ecological threats at a scale relevant to the system being studied. For coastal marine systems, this could mean the entire West Coast," he said.</p>
<p>As word has spread about the Intertidal SWAT Team's expertise and growing database of information, requests for samples and data have begun pouring in from outside scientists. "A lot of people just want to pick our brains about species distributions, because we travel so much. We have in our heads a lot of information about where you can find different species and general trends that would be hard to find in textbooks or journals," Livingston said.</p>
<p>The typical survey site is a gently sloping, rocky intertidal bench. The survey protocol is the same at every site and begins with laying out a giant grid that extends at least 30 meters along the shore and as far out as the tide goes. Team members record the species present at 100 locations along each of 11 transect lines running down the bench toward the ocean. At three spots along each transect, they lay down a large square of PVC pipe and record all the mobile invertebrates, such as snails, limpets, and crabs, within the square. They also map the locations of all sea stars (important predators in the intertidal zone) along each transect.</p>
<p>Team members move quickly, recording data on Palm Pilots equipped with bar-code readers so that common organisms can be recorded by simply scanning a bar code on a laminated data sheet. At the end of the day, all of the data are downloaded onto a laptop computer.</p>
<p>On the first visit to a site, the team drills bolts into the rocks to help them relocate the same site for repeat surveys in subsequent years. The team also creates a detailed topographic map of each site using surveying equipment and 3-dimensional computer graphics. "Then we can overlay the species we've recorded onto the topographic map, so you get a picture of how small changes in elevation can affect which species are present," Livingston said.</p>
<p>The team is often accompanied by other members of Raimondi's lab, other PISCO researchers, volunteer helpers, and local experts. Two key contributors to the SWAT team's work are David Lohse, a postdoctoral researcher in Raimondi's lab, and Carol Blanchette, a PISCO scientific coordinator based at UC Santa Barbara. Lohse works closely with the SWAT team and helps out at many of the survey sites. Blanchette helps in the field and with data management and analysis.</p>
<p>Kendall and Kusic, who both have bachelor's degrees in marine biology, were among the four original members of the SWAT team. Livingston, who has degrees in environmental studies and water resource management, joined a year later.</p>
<p>"I can identify hundreds of species now, but it took a lot of training. The learning curve is really steep, even for those who come in with a degree in marine biology," Livingston said.</p>
<p><strong>Taxonomic workshops</strong></p>
<p>Team members regularly attend taxonomic workshops to hone their identification skills, and Kusic recalls taking furious notes at the workshops during her first year on the job. One year later, however, she and other team members were leading some of those same workshops.</p>
<p>Whenever the team goes to a new survey site, members contact regional experts and, if possible, bring them along to help with species identifications. But there are few intertidal experts who have seen as much of the West Coast as the SWAT team.</p>
<p>"We get to go to a lot of great places, including some remote places that most people don't have access to," Kusic said. "And we get to work with the local experts and rangers who really know the area and are willing to share their knowledge with us."</p>
<p>"It's a dream job, being outdoors and working in these amazing places," Kendall added.</p>
<p>The SWAT team spends a lot of time on the road, moving from site to site. The surveys have taken them to the Gulf of California, the Channel Islands, and Glacier Bay, Alaska. All of the team members enjoy the work and love being outdoors, but by the end of the field season they are ready to spend some time at home, Kusic said. From midsummer into fall, the minus tides tend to occur at night, and during this period the team keeps busy at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, sorting specimens and organizing their data.</p>
<p>"Voucher" specimens are collected to document the species identified during the surveys. The team's algal specimens are now stored at UC Berkeley's Jepson Herbarium, while the invertebrate specimens will be housed at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. "All the taxonomists we worked with told us that no one would believe our results if we didn't have voucher specimens," Kendall said.</p>
<p>Several members of the SWAT team have recently moved on to other things. Erin Maloney, one of the original members, left a few months ago to run an invasive species program at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. Megan Williams, also an original member, spent the past year studying science writing at UCSC and will soon be on her way to New York to work for Discover magazine. Caroline Engel, who has been with the team for about a year, will be working part-time in a PISCO research lab. Kendall took last year off to study science illustration at UCSC and is only back with the team temporarily.</p>
<p>The fact that all of the SWAT team members so far have been women was not by design, although it does make sharing tents and motel rooms a bit easier, Livingston said. "But we're a nonexclusive club," she said.</p>
<p>People often ask them what SWAT stands for. Officially, they say, it doesn't stand for anything, but unofficial suggestions from team members abound, including Soaking Wet and Tired; Stinky, Wrinkled and Tough; SeaWeed Action Team; and Scientific Women at the Tides.</p>
<p>Primary funding for the intertidal SWAT team's coastal biodiversity survey is from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation through the PISCO project and from the Minerals Management Service, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior. More information about the survey is available on the team's web site at http://cbsurveys.ucsc.edu.</p>
<p>PISCO is a long-term, interdisciplinary program that includes research and monitoring of not only the intertidal zone, but also the nearshore rocky reefs and kelp beds along more than 1,200 miles of coastline in California and Oregon. Started in 1999 with a five-year, $20 million grant from the Packard Foundation, PISCO is led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara, Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station, and Oregon State University. The Packard Foundation has provided an additional $4 million grant this year to support PISCO's ongoing work.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914df4198072704601a012ffe2842b86"><name>544</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC researchers to test new technologies for monitoring harmful algal blooms in California coastal waters</title><author>Tim Stephens, UC Santa Cruz, (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu; Lea Brooks, CDHS, (916) 440-7660, lbrooks@dhs.ca.gov; Aja Sae-Kung, NOAA, (202) 482-6090, aja.sae-kung@noaa.gov</author><start-date>1094626800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC researchers to test...</display-name><path>/2004/09/544</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/544</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338059234</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338059234</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have received a $400,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop an improved system for monitoring toxic algae in the coastal waters of California. The UCSC researchers will work closely with the California Department of Health Services (CDHS), testing new technologies and developing protocols for using them as part of the state's ongoing program of monitoring marine biotoxins to ensure the safety of fish and shellfish harvested along the coast. </p><p>"The current system is working, but it is labor intensive. New technologies are available that could make the system for ensuring seafood safety more efficient and more cost-effective," said Peter Miller, a researcher in UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and principal investigator on the project.</p><p>The grant from NOAA's Monitoring and Event Response for Harmful Algal Blooms (MERHAB) program provides crucial support for the extensive field testing and validation needed  before new methods can be incorporated into the state's monitoring program, Miller said. </p><p>The grant initiates a planned five-year, $2 million effort by NOAA's MERHAB program to engage key academic and state agency partners in developing harmful algal bloom detection and tracking tools at intensive study sites in Marin, Monterey, and San Luis Obispo Counties. UCSC and CDHS, the state agency charged with ensuring seafood safety, are coleading this effort to implement an economically sustainable harmful algal bloom monitoring plan for the California coastline. </p><p>Two toxins produced by different kinds of microscopic marine algae, or phytoplankton, are of particular concern on the West Coast. Both are potent neurotoxins, causing the syndromes known as paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning. When there are large numbers of toxin-producing algae in the water, filter-feeders such as mussels and other shellfish accumulate the toxins in their tissues. Anchovies and sardines can also accumulate the toxins, mostly in their guts. </p><p>Consumption of tainted shellfish can lead to severe illness and even death. Along the California coast, harmful algal blooms routinely poison and kill sea lions, sea otters, and other marine animals, and cause economic harm by forcing the closure of affected fisheries. </p><p>The existing CDHS monitoring program relies primarily on routine analysis of shellfish samples to detect toxins before they reach dangerous levels. A statewide network of volunteers, many of them from local public health agencies, collects samples and sends them to a central laboratory for toxin analysis. The toxin analysis is expensive, however, and the process of collecting, shipping, and testing samples is time-consuming, said Gregg Langlois, a marine biologist with CDHS who oversees the agency's marine biotoxin monitoring program.</p><p>"We need better tools to do this more efficiently and to get information more quickly," Langlois said. </p><p>Several types of diagnostic test kits are now available that allow rapid detection of toxins in the field. The kits could be used for prescreening of shellfish samples, enabling technicians in the field to weed out toxin-free samples that would otherwise be shipped to the central lab and put through a costly and time-consuming analysis. Laboratory analysis could then focus on determining how much toxin is present in positive samples, Langlois said.</p><p>There are also new laboratory-based techniques for analysis of water samples using molecular probes to rapidly detect the algal species that produce the toxins and measure their abundance. Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite observations and radar tracking of surface currents, offer the potential to locate and track major blooms of toxin-producing algae and predict where they will go. </p><p> Using the best available remote sensing data in conjunction with field data provided by the volunteer force may provide an early warning system and enable tracking of bloom events in real time along the California coast, Miller said. This information can then guide decisions about when and where to intensify monitoring efforts in the field.</p><p>"The power of this approach is that it paves the way for the network of program participants, including fishermen, aquaculturists, and volunteers with oversight from CDHS, to prescreen samples in the field using new technologies," Miller said. </p><p>The UCSC-led MERHAB program will establish pilot project sites where these new technologies are evaluated and incorporated into an intensive monitoring program. In addition to Miller and Langlois, the project's leaders include UCSC faculty Mary Silver, a professor of ocean sciences who has been studying harmful algal blooms since the early 1990s, and Raphael Kudela, an assistant professor of ocean sciences with expertise in remote sensing. </p><p>Miller noted that the program was jointly conceived and developed by CDHS and UCSC scientists. This kind of collaboration between a state agency and academic researchers, with funding from a federal agency, is an effective way to bring cutting-edge research to bear on practical issues of public health policy, he said.</p><p>Langlois said he will be focusing on the "grassroots" element of the program, making sure that any new field procedures added to the monitoring program will not be too burdensome for the volunteer network and that there are clear-cut protocols for using them.</p><p>"You have to have criteria for deciding when you will burn a $20 test kit, so we need to evaluate these new tools in the field and develop protocols and a decision-tree for implementing them," Langlois said. </p><p>"We also need to make it simple and easy for the volunteers, and it has to be fun," he added. "It can be fun, and that keeps people involved in the program."</p><p>Partners in the project include the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and NOAA Fisheries Southeast.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Miller at (831) 459-5005 or pemiller@ucsc.edu.</p><p>Information about harmful algal blooms on the West Coast can be found on the web at <a href="http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/hab/">www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/hab</a>.</p><p>Information about NOAA's MERHAB program is available at <a href="http://www.cop.noaa.gov/Fact_Sheets/MERHAB.html">www.cop.noaa.gov/Fact_Sheets/MERHAB.html</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914df5668072704601a012ff7e587778"><name>545</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gary Lease named interim dean of humanities at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1094799600000</start-date><display-name>Gary Lease named interim...</display-name><path>/2004/09/545</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/545</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338059574</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338059574</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>

Now she is giving financial support to a new generation of graduate students in her field through an endowed fellowship fund.</p>
<p>The Jean H. Langenheim Graduate Fellowship in Plant Ecology and Evolution, funded by Langenheim's gift of $200,000 to the UCSC Foundation, will be available to graduate students in the Departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>Langenheim, an eminent plant ecologist, said the gift had long been part of her plans for her estate, but she decided to make it now because recent cuts in state funding and increases in student tuition and fees have made support for graduate students a critical issue for the campus.</p>
<p>"I wanted to do it now because this is such a critical time for graduate student funding," Langenheim said.</p>
<p>Because the endowment needs to grow for at least one year to begin generating funds for fellowships, Langenheim has made an additional gift of $8,650 to ensure that the fellowship can be awarded to a student for the 2004-05 academic year. Langenheim's gifts add to a long history of philanthropic contributions from her to the campus, said Sarah Schuster, assistant director of development for physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>"I simply decided to support the field in which I have been doing research for so long," Langenheim said. "It actually surprised me to look back and realize that it has been 60 years since I took my first courses in plant ecology."</p>
<p>Since joining the UCSC faculty in 1966, Langenheim has overseen the work of 41 graduate students as an adviser or coadviser. She said UC Santa Cruz is a wonderful place for botanical research. The UCSC Arboretum, the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, and the Natural Reserve System all offer excellent resources and opportunities for studying the ecology and evolution of plants. The campus has a strong tradition of research in the plant sciences by faculty and students, who have done extensive research not only in California but throughout the world, especially in the tropics, Langenheim said.</p>
<p>The fellowship is intended to support graduate students with a broad range of interests within the general area of terrestrial plant ecology and evolution. How plants adapt to their environment, how they have coevolved with other organisms, the effects of global warming on plants, and the development of sustainable management practices for both natural and agricultural ecosystems are among the many possible areas of study that would be eligible for support.</p>
<p>Langenheim is renowned for her investigations of plant resins and amber. She wrote the authoritative book on the subject, Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany, published by Timber Press in 2003. The book was recently awarded the 2004 Klinger Book Award from the Society for Economic Botany.</p>
<p>Langenheim has served as the president of the Association for Tropical Biology, the Ecological Society of America, the International Society of Chemical Ecology, and the Society for Economic Botany. She also represented UC on the board of directors for and was academic vice president of the Organization for Tropical Studies. She has traveled throughout the world in the course of her research, studying tropical trees as well as redwoods and other Pacific Coast plants. Langenheim remains active in research and continues to supervise graduate students at UCSC.</p>

She is interested in using aspects of remotely sensed data and mathematical modeling to study the way plant diversity is organized across California landscapes. As an undergraduate at Brown University, Barber completed an extensive project in game reserves in north-central Tanzania that involved both botanical fieldwork and discussions of land management issues with the local Masai people. </p><p>Nelson will be working with Erika Zavaleta, assistant professor of environmental studies. Her  proposed research addresses the biological, physical, and social effects of regional climate change in the boreal forest of North America. She will be working with a computer model currently used to investigate the interactions of vegetation, climate, and fire in interior Alaska. Nelson wants to expand the model to include interactions involving the human communities in the region.</p><p>D'Amore will be working with Kerstin Wasson, assistant adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, to study the California red-legged frog populations in the Elkhorn Slough area. She plans to integrate the results of surveys for the frog from a variety of sources to create accurate maps of its historic and current distribution. In addition, her work aims to characterize the types of habitat used by the frog in different stages of its life cycle. These efforts will contribute to an understanding of the factors causing populations of this threatened species to decline. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dfc0f8072704601a012ff928ffe44"><name>549</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Acclaimed New Yorker magazine staff writer and UCSC alumnus to return for speaking engagement at Cowell College</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1095318000000</start-date><display-name>Acclaimed New Yorker magazine...</display-name><path>/2004/09/549</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/549</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338061278</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338061278</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For the past two decades, longtime New Yorker magazine staff writer and UC Santa Cruz alumnus Lawrence Weschler has written about unexpected relationships between art, culture, war, and peace. </p><p> On Friday, September 24, the 1974 Cowell College graduate will return to the UCSC campus to speak on the topic: "Serenity and Terror in Vermeer, and After," based on his most recent book, Vermeer in Bosnia. The event takes place at 8 p.m. in the Cowell Conference Room. Admission is free and open to the public. </p><p>	</p><p>Vermeer in Bosnia is a collection of 22 stories written for the New Yorker and a variety of other publications. The title piece includes reports on the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal in 1995 and its connection to 17-th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer--who due to a youth spent living in a Europe as war-torn as Bosnia, had to invent the very peace and serenity prized in his paintings. </p><p>	</p><p>Vermeer in Bosnia also includes stories on three Polish survivors of World War II-film director Roman Polanski, newspaperman Jerzy Urban, and cartoonist Art Spiegelman's father; pieces about Weschler's grandfather, composer Ernst Toch; and several takes on artists and their inspirations, such as David Hockney's photo collages, Robert Irwin's youth, and Ed Weinberger's furniture design/philosophy. </p><p>Weschler is the author of 10 previous books including Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder, which was short-listed for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Currently the director of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU, he is a widely honored political and cultural journalist and a regular contributor to such publications as McSweeny's, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Threepenny Review, and National Public Radio. </p><p>Weschler initiated the UCSC visit to coincide with a September West Coast book tour. He has made a point over the years of keeping in touch with Cowell College and his former teachers such as associate professor of philosophy Robert Goff, literature professor emeritus Harry Berger, biology professor emeritus Todd Newberry, and American studies professor emeritus John Dizikes. </p><p>"The ambition and breadth of Weschler's writing was already present when he was a student," said Goff. "He won the Chancellor's Essay prize three or four times in succession. He was known among his teachers as someone who would make connections across fields; he would seek people out for new ideas, no matter what their specialty was."</p><p>Goff noted that it was due to Weschler's influence in 1985 that famed neurologist/writer Oliver Sacks accepted a position as a Regents' Professor at Cowell College. Sacks's first popular book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, had just been published, and he taught a seminar about it at UCSC. In the early 1990s, Weschler himself returned to the campus as a Regents' Lecturer, offering an abbreviated course  through Cowell College on how to read a newspaper.</p><p>"He's always looking for new sources and is a great encourager of writers," Goff observed. "He is now a contributing editor of Dave Eggers's McSweeny's, an exciting new literary periodical."</p><p>"Weschler's effect is catalytic," Goff added. "When you talk to him or read his work, it makes you want to do things differently." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dfd6c8072704601a012ffa95b6249"><name>550</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NIH training grants provide more than $1.5 million to support graduate students at UCSC</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1095318000000</start-date><display-name>NIH training grants provide...</display-name><path>/2004/09/550</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/550</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338061632</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338061632</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are receiving increased support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through training grants to two campus departments. The prestigious NIH training grants provide support for graduate students in specified areas of biomedical research. The agency has awarded a new NIH training grant in bioinformatics to the Department of Biomolecular Engineering and has renewed an existing training grant to the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology (MCD Biology). </p><p>"Receiving these grants is considered a sign of having an outstanding graduate program," said Richard Hughey, professor and chair of computer engineering and principal investigator on the bioinformatics training grant.</p><p>In addition to providing direct support for graduate students, the grants also provide flexible funding that departments can use to support graduate training programs. The five-year grants amount to $850,000 for MCD biology and $800,000 for biomolecular engineering.</p><p>Budget pressures have made it more difficult than ever to win these coveted grants, so UCSC faculty were especially pleased to see the campus's share grow this year. The rising cost of supporting graduate students, combined with a fixed pool of funds, means that the number of students nationwide who can be supported by agencies like NIH is shrinking.</p><p>"It is definitely becoming more competitive, and we underwent a very rigorous review of our program before it was renewed," said Douglas Kellogg, professor of MCD biology and principal investigator on the MCD biology training grant.</p><p>Hughey noted that the new bioinformatics training grant was awarded despite the fact that the campus's Ph.D. program in bioinformatics had not yet been formally approved when the application was submitted. Even without a formal program, however, UCSC's faculty and graduate students had already established a strong reputation in the field of bioinformatics, which uses information technology and computer science to solve complex problems in biology and biochemistry.</p><p>Hughey said the bioinformatics grant will provide full funding for three graduate students the first year, increasing to five students for the remaining four years of the five-year grant. Training for the students will include a rotation program in which they will spend time working in different laboratories with faculty in both biomolecular engineering and MCD biology. </p><p>"By coordinating with the MCD biology program, we're trying to eliminate the boundaries between the disciplines. It's especially important for students in bioinformatics to have relationships with people in related programs," Hughey said.</p><p>The MCD biology training grant will provide support for four graduate students per year initially, increasing to six students by the end of the five-year grant, Kellogg said. The grant supports students involved in biomedical research in four departments: MCD biology, chemistry and biochemistry, environmental toxicology, and biomolecular engineering. Administered by MCD biology, the awards are made to selected graduate students based on merit. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dfed68072704601a012ffca90a78d"><name>552</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: New academic year brings new students, academic offerings, housing, other facilities</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1095318000000</start-date><display-name>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: New academic...</display-name><path>/2004/09/552</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/552</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338061974</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338061974</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>SANTA CRUZ, CA--UC Santa Cruz students began moving into university housing today (Thursday, September 16) in anticipation of the 2004-05 school year. The first day of instruction in the fall quarter is Thursday, September 23.</p><p>The fall-quarter "move in" for students living on campus continues through Sunday, September 19. (See schedule, below, for photo opportunities.)</p><p>	</p><p>Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body, new academic programs the campus is offering, and new buildings that are opening:</p><p><b>New Academic Programs for UCSC Students:</b></p><p>. The Baskin School of Engineering has established a Department of Biomolecular Engineering. The new department has added a new undergraduate minor established (in addition to the existing B.S.) in bioinformatics, and new master's and Ph.D. programs in bioinformatics.</p><p>. The Department of Physics is offering a new bachelor's degree in applied physics.</p><p>. The Department of Music is offering a new doctorate of musical arts in composition, the first such </p><p>program in the UC system. Students can apply for admission to the program this year for fall 2005.</p><p>. The Department of Community Studies is offering a new master's program in social documentation. Students can apply for admission to the program this year for fall 2005.</p><p><b>Enrollment:</b></p><p>UCSC is expecting a 2004-05 enrollment of approximately 14,550 students; last year's official enrollment was 14,372.</p><p>Of the 14,550 students in 2004-05, approximately 13,050 are expected to be undergraduates; 1,500 are projected to enroll in graduate studies over the course of the year. Of the 13,050 undergraduates expected to enroll in the academic year, approximately 4,000 will be new students (3,100 freshmen and 900 transfer students). These 4,000 new undergraduates were admitted from among nearly 30,000 applicants, a record number for UCSC. </p><p><b>Profile of New Freshmen:</b></p><p>The most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are in the many areas of the biological sciences and in psychology.</p><p>	</p><p>Approximately 40 percent of the freshmen have not declared a major, however. In an effort to better focus these students' selection of lower-division courses, UCSC has given them the option of selecting a "cluster" subject area of interest. More than 1,200 undeclared students are participating in this advising program, having selected one of the following clusters: business and economics; education; environmental sciences; human psychology, culture, and society; information sciences, engineering, and technology; languages, literatures, and communication; liberal arts and area studies; life and health sciences; physical sciences and math; and visual and performing arts and media.</p><p><b>Housing UCSC Students/New Buildings:</b></p><p>New "infill" apartments for students are opening this fall at Cowell, Stevenson, Porter, and Kresge Colleges; Cowell, Stevenson, and Porter Colleges previously had only residence halls. The new student apartments-providing "bed spaces" for an additional 651 students on campus-range from one-bedroom apartments for two people each, to floor plans for six students. The new units are broken down as follows: Cowell, space for 185 students; Stevenson, 136; Porter, 234; and Kresge, 96. Community rooms are part of the project at each college.</p><p>The $62 million Engineering 2 Building, located behind the Baskin Engineering Building, is also opening this fall and is designed to include research, classroom, and departmental space.</p><p><b>Contact:</b></p><p>UCSC administrators are available for phone or in-person interviews to discuss the campus's enrollment projections, the entering class, and other "back-to-school" subjects. To schedule an interview, please call UCSC's Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495 (weekdays, 8 A.M. to 5 P.M.).</p><p>_____</p><p>PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES</p><p><b>Friday, September 17:</b></p><p>Acting Chancellor Martin M.

Chemers. "It will be invaluable in building on campus achievements in cutting-edge research and undergraduate teaching."</p><p> </p><p>The largest single contribution was a $17.5 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, part of a University of California-California Institute of Technology project to build the world's most powerful telescope. Known as the Thirty-Meter Telescope, it will provide images more than 12 times sharper than those of the Hubble Space Telescope and have nine times the light-gathering ability of one of the 10-meter Keck Telescopes, currently the largest in the world.</p><p>The largest gift ever for scholarships in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering was made in memory of software engineer and alumna Amy Snader, who died in a hiking accident. The estate of Barbara Snader, Amy Snader's mother, donated $1 million to the Amy Beth Snader Memorial Scholarship Fund, established in 1997, to benefit women studying engineering.</p><p>The New Teacher Center's focus on programs for new teachers and administrators drew grants from many sources. Grants totaling $700,000 from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and $587,408 from the Stupski Family Foundation were among the awards. </p><p>A long-term collaborative research project involving the study and monitoring of coastal ecosystems continued to receive funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The foundation augmented its original grant--involving four major universities in California and Oregon--with $1.1 million for UC Santa Cruz. Called the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), the project focuses on connections among the nearshore biological communities along 1,200 miles of coastline from southern California to Oregon.</p><p>"We raised $32 million this year due to the world-class excellence of our faculty and inspiration of our students, fueled by the leadership of Chancellor Greenwood, Acting Chancellor Chemers, and our deans," said Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor of University Relations. "We will build upon this success."</p><p>Efforts to increase scholarship funding are already under way: The campus's first Scholarships Benefit Dinner in the fall of 2003 raised more than $500,000 to support undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships.</p><p>Individual donors continued to provide crucial support in 2003-04. The Telephone Outreach Program raised a record $1.16 million from alumni and parents of students, and UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustees contributed $467,874. Alumni celebrating five-year through 35-year reunions raised more than $245,000 to support campus programs and the colleges, and the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund raised $109,130.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e02158072704601a012ffc8804a52"><name>554</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC astronomer Claire Max receives 2004 E.

Max, who is deputy director of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UCSC and holds a joint appointment at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, received the award for her contributions to the theory of laser guide star adaptive optics and its application in ground-based astronomy. Adaptive optics sharpens the vision of telescopes by correcting for the blurring effects of the atmosphere.</p><p>The E. O. Lawrence Award is given in seven categories to honor scientists and engineers for exceptional  contributions in the field of atomic energy, broadly defined. The awards were established in 1959 in memory of the pioneering physicist Ernest Orlando Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. Three of the seven winners this year are UC faculty and five are affiliated with the national laboratories managed by UC.</p><p>The awards will be presented in a ceremony in Washington, D.C., on November 8. Each recipient receives a gold medal, a citation, and $50,000. </p><p>"We are all enriched by the contributions these researchers have made, ranging from engines with no moving parts to better ways to see the stars," said Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham.</p><p>Max has made important contributions to the separate fields of plasma physics and astrophysics, and she is a central figure in the field of adaptive optics for ground-based telescopes. Her work on laser guide stars for adaptive optics has led to an ongoing revolution in ground-based astronomy. </p><p>Adaptive optics (AO) enables astronomers to counteract the blurring effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere, which seriously degrades images seen by ground-based telescopes. An AO system precisely measures the blurring of a telescope's image caused by the atmosphere, then corrects the image using a special deformable mirror. These measurements and corrections are made hundreds of times per second. </p><p>The instantaneous measurement of atmospheric blurring along the line of sight of the telescope requires a bright point-source of light in the field of view. The first AO systems relied on bright stars, but this limited the use of AO to areas of the sky where there are natural guide stars. Max is one of the inventors of the sodium laser guide star as a source of the bright reference light, and she is a leader in implementing these new artificial guide stars at astronomical observatories. Today, ground-based telescopes using AO systems with laser guide stars are delivering high-resolution infrared images that rival, or in some cases even exceed, the sharpness of the infrared cameras on the Hubble Space Telescope.</p><p>Max joined the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1974 as part of a new group formed to understand the plasma physics aspects of laser fusion. She made important contributions to laser-plasma interactions and to the understanding of astrophysical plasmas. In 1984, she became the founding director of the Livermore branch of UC's Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, and in this role she helped guide much of Livermore's astrophysical and geophysical research. </p><p>Also in the early 1980s, Max became the first female member of the elite JASON group of scientific advisers to the Department of Defense. In 1983, she carried out some of the first detailed theoretical work on adaptive optics for its possible application to strategic defense when she and three fellow JASONs conceived the idea of the sodium laser guide star for ground-based telescopes. </p><p>The laser creates an artificial "star" by exciting sodium atoms in a tenuous layer in the upper atmosphere at an altitude of about 100 kilometers (60 miles). Since the high-altitude sodium layer covers the whole sky, a laser guide star is created wherever the laser beam intercepts the sodium layer. Aiming the laser to follow the telescope ensures that a guide star is always close to the astronomical object of interest.</p><p>Max and her team of LLNL scientists demonstrated the concept by making a star high in the sky above the Livermore site. Work on this topic had been highly classified until the early 1990s, but was declassified in time for the LLNL laser experiment. Max then led a group that built the AO system and sodium laser guide star for UC's Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton. This laser guide star AO system was the first to be installed at an astronomical observatory and is currently the only one in the world used by astronomers on a regular basis. </p><p>Max's group also designed the laser beacon and AO system for the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii in collaboration with Keck Observatory staff. The AO systems at Keck's two 10-meter telescopes (the largest in the world) produce infrared images that rival or exceed those of the Hubble Space telescope at the same wavelengths. They have already borne important fruit, including infrared images and spectra of storms on Neptune, hydrocarbon oceans and ice continents on Saturn's moon Titan, and black holes in the core of our own Milky Way galaxy and in the centers of other galaxies nearby. The newly operational laser beacon at the Keck II Telescope is producing spectacular results.</p><p>Although laser guide star adaptive optics on ground-based telescopes is still in its infancy, the expanded science that can be done with such modified telescopes is extraordinary. Adaptive optics enhances the clarity of ground-based observations by a factor of 50 or more so that it becomes comparable with that of space telescopes. The larger ground-based telescopes already have the advantage of greater light-gathering capacity than space telescopes. </p><p>Perhaps one of the most important future uses of adaptive optics will be the direct detection of extrasolar planets (planets outside our solar system). Much of the basis for using AO to search for extrasolar planets has been developed by scientists in Max's team. </p><p>Max earned her A.B. degree in astronomy from Harvard University (Radcliffe College) in 1968 and her Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences and plasma physics from Princeton University in 1972. Her many honors include election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. Max joined the Center for Adaptive Optics as an associate director when it was established by the National Science Foundation in 1999, and she has been a member of the UCSC faculty since 2001. </p><p>The other recipients of this year's E. O. Lawrence awards are Nathaniel Fisch of Princeton University (nuclear technology); Bette Korber (life sciences), Fred Mortensen (national security), and Gregory Swift (environmental science and technology) of Los Alamos National Laboratory; Richard Saykally of UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (chemistry); and Ivan Schuller of UC San Diego (materials research).</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Max at (831) 459-2049 or max@ucolick.org.</p><p>Information about all of the 2004 winners is available at the Department of Energy web site at <a href="http://www.energy.gov">www.energy.gov</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e03788072704601a012ff9402b8a5"><name>555</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supervising producer of Fahrenheit 9/11 speaks at UC Santa Cruz October 6</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu </author><keywords>Fahrenheit 9/11, Tia Lessin, Documentary Film</keywords><start-date>1096268400000</start-date><display-name>Supervising producer of Fahrenheit...</display-name><path>/2004/09/555</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/555</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338063177</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338063177</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Documentary filmmaker Tia Lessin, the supervising producer of <I>Fahrenheit 9/11</I>, will give a free public talk on Wednesday, October 6, at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>	Lessin's talk, "Documentary Film and Human Rights," will take place from noon to 1:30 p.m. in Room 150 of the Communications Building.</p><p>	An accomplished filmmaker in her own right, Lessin has been part of Moore's team for almost 10 years, working as supervising producer on <I>Fahrenheit 9/11</I>, winner of the 2003 Cannes Palme D'Or and the highest-grossing documentary film in history, and the Oscar-winning <I>Bowling for Columbine</I>.

All paperwork was finalized on September 24. The site is located at 2300 Delaware Avenue in Santa Cruz. </p><p>"This is a unique and very desirable opportunity for our campus," stated Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers. "Vice Chancellor Tom Vani and his team have facilitated the acquisition, and they deserve enormous credit for this major addition to campus resources."</p><p>	Near the array of research operations at Long Marine Laboratory and vicinity, the facilities may serve to consolidate current off-campus leases used for administrative fucntions and to house research and teaching activities. Plans for use of the property are still being finalized.</p><p> </p><p>"Although we don't yet have detailed plans for this facility," Chemers noted, "it is clear that there is great potential for a range of uses, and we are finalizing a process for allocating this new space to highest priority needs."</p><p>The purchase price of the property and its contents is $5 million, constituting a bargain sale. The difference between the appraised value of the property ($11.5 million) and the purchase price represents a $6.5 million charitable contribution. Additional gift value will be attributed to the contents of the property at a later date.  "This generous gift provides a significant boost to private support and underscores TI's history as a benefactor of education," noted University Relations Vice Chancellor Ronald P. Suduiko. </p><p>The 18.5-acre site encompasses a total of approximately 232,000 gross (136,000 net) square feet of facilities, including a large "clean room," a specially designed computer area, extensive space that could be used for classrooms, laboratories, and offices, plus ample parking.</p><p>Besides providing needed space, the site offers the potential of a new campus and community partnership. University and City of Santa Cruz officials are discussing the feasibility of locating a business incubator or some other enterprise at the location.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e061b8072704601a012ffcad5f273"><name>557</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: You are invited to cover a tour of new apartments for 651 students on the UC Santa Cruz campus</title><author>Louise Donahue, (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1094540400000</start-date><display-name>EDITOR'S ADVISORY: You are...</display-name><path>/2004/09/557</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/557</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338063852</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338063852</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>New on-campus apartments for 651 UC Santa Cruz students will be on display during an open house and tour for local government officials, the campus community, and the news media. Students will occupy the housing when the fall quarter begins later this month.</p>
<p><strong>When and where:</strong> 9:30 a.m. to noon, September 9, beginning with a 30-minute presentation by Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor for Colleges and University Housing Services, at the Porter/Kresge Colleges Community Room.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The new apartment complexes will serve students at four (Cowell, Stevenson, Porter, and Kresge) of the campus's 10 residential colleges. The design of the housing ranges from one-bedroom units to apartments designed for six or seven residents.</p>
<p>Apartment living is an increasingly popular option for students at UCSC and nationwide. The housing will mean the residential colleges of Cowell, Stevenson, and Porter-which until now have contained residence halls only-will have apartments; the all-apartment Kresge College will add beds. The 651 new units are broken down as follows: Cowell, 185; Stevenson, 136; Porter, 234; and Kresge, 96.</p>
<p>Construction began in 2002 and was completed this summer. In addition to the no-commute convenience of living on campus, the furnished apartments also boast high-speed Internet access and cable access, community rooms, and laundry facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Tour parking:</strong> Parking will be available during the tour at Porter/Kresge Colleges. If you need a parking permit, please call UCSC's Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.</p>

Of all the works displayed, only one is less than six feet long in at least one dimension, and nearly half are 10 feet long or more. Consisting of prints from the Anderson Collection and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the exhibition offers significant examples of artwork that has defied technical and artistic assumptions about the nature of print media.</p><p>The Big and Bold exhibition was arranged in conjunction with an advanced undergraduate seminar taught by Catherine M. Soussloff, an art history professor at UC Santa Cruz. Working closely with the museum, 12 university students from her History  and Visual Culture 190M class researched large-scale prints by prominent American artists from 1970 to the present. They held collaborative discussions, interviewed living artists, and visited the presses that produced the prints-in addition to conducting extensive archival, library, and web-based investigations. Based on this research, the students then produced original wall label descriptions and interpretations for each of the prints displayed to help educate the public about the exhibition. </p><p>"It was a highly innovative project," noted Soussloff, who has taught at UCSC for the past 17 years. "It is really the first time the university has done this kind of a collaboration-it's very unusual for students to work directly with such well-known artists at a museum."</p><p>The idea for the collaboration came from Kathleen Moodie, curator at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History. </p><p>"We've never had students writing labels and wall panels before," said Moodie. "But I was inspired by a project at Stanford University's Cantor Center for the Arts. At Stanford, the students gave information to the curators, who went on to actually write the text themselves. This time, I thought we'd take a chance and have the UCSC students write it instead." </p><p>Soussloff noted that the collaborative process gave her seminar an edge of excitement because the stakes were much higher for the students than simply handing in a research paper. She added that next to each print at the exhibition resides a large photo and a brief biography (often amusing) of the UCSC student who researched that particular work. </p><p>"We had this great comradery in the class," Soussloff observed. "In my teaching experience, it certainly stood out as one of the best seminars I've ever taught."</p><p>Barrie Lockitch, a 21-year-old student in the seminar who did research on the Lichtenstein print, was equally enthusiastic about the experience.</p><p>"The student insight and the freshness of ideas-guided by Professor Soussloff, an expert in the field-should be interesting to people who are trying to gain knowledge of what students are learning about at the campus," said Lockitch. "It reinforces the positive ties between students and the community." </p><p>Big and Bold: American Graphic Art from the Anderson Collection and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco runs through November 28 at the Museum of Art and History in Santa Cruz.

Managed by UC Santa Cruz in partnership with NASA Ames Research Center under a <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=396">10-year, $330 million contract between UC and NASA</a>, the UARC has received an excellent performance rating from NASA during its first year of operation. </p><p>UC researchers, both at UARC facilities and at several UC campuses, are now working together with NASA Ames researchers on a broad range of NASA projects in areas such as air traffic management, human space exploration, and nanotechnology. UC Santa Cruz is planning to build on the success of the UARC by establishing a technology and management complex for research and education in the NASA Research Park. </p><p>"UCSC is working with NASA and Silicon Valley companies to develop plans for a permanent facility, with the UARC as the anchor tenant and its focus aligned to the interests of Silicon Valley companies," said William Berry, managing director of the UARC and deputy director of UCSC's Silicon Valley Initiative. </p><p>The new facility would serve as a direct extension of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, which is already creating new programs based in Silicon Valley. A key focus area for the engineering school, as well as for NASA Ames, is nanotechnology and its fusion with biotechnology and information technologies. </p><p>"The economic revival of Silicon Valley industry and the education of future workforces critically depend on our success in research and education in bio-info-nano technologies and in the management of technologies. The matching of research foci between NASA and the Baskin School of Engineering is not only timely, but also reinforces the strategic planning of our engineering program to be on the frontiers of research and education," said Steve Kang, dean of the engineering school. </p><p>Most of the UARC research tasks are currently being carried out in shared facilities at NASA Ames, but the UARC has also begun placing research tasks at UC campuses. A project to develop technology for human space exploration involves investigators at the Santa Cruz, Davis, Irvine, and Berkeley campuses. The UARC is also about to receive its first funding from NASA for aligned research programs--$400,000 of discretionary money that will be awarded to UC researchers for new projects related to UARC activities. </p><p>"We're very excited about that because it allows us to pursue new research directions. The research will be broadly aligned with the mission of the UARC and focused on building future collaborations with NASA," Berry said.</p><p>UCSC researchers working at Moffett Field are currently carrying out research tasks for the UARC in three areas: aerospace systems, information technology and computer science, and nanotechnology. The UCSC employees hired to work on these projects include both staff researchers and project scientists with academic appointments, said Larry Hogle, research project director for the UARC.</p><p>In aerospace systems, the majority of the work focuses on air traffic management as part of a long-term NASA research effort to develop advanced air traffic management software and support tools. "The goal is to improve air traffic flow so as to optimize capacity both in the air space and on the ground at the airports," Hogle said. </p><p>The UARC's information technology and computer science mission encompasses a range of research tasks, most of which provide support for human space exploration. For example, spoken dialogue systems are a key technology for many NASA projects, promising to enable astronauts and others to interact with complex diagnostic and control systems using spoken-language interfaces. </p><p>In nanotechnology, part of the research effort involves computational approaches, such as large-scale computational simulations and theoretical modeling of the properties and behavior of nanostructured materials (materials made from nanometer-scale building blocks). Computational nanotechnology complements and supports the experimental nanotechnology research carried out by UARC researchers in collaboration with the NASA Ames Center for Nanotechnology. This work focuses on the design and manufacturing of devices such as nanoelectronic sensors that NASA could use in the exploration of the solar system and the possible detection of extraterrestrial life. </p><p>The integration of nanotechnology with biotechnology and information technologies promises to yield innovative solutions to NASA's needs, Berry said. "The bio-info-nano convergence is an area where we expect to see significant growth over the next few years," he said. </p><p>In addition to the UARC's research mission, its Systems Teaching Institute (STI) is helping to build NASA's future workforce. UCSC and San Jose State University are partners in the institute, which provides mentoring and other programs to recruit and support students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Since its formation in early 2004, STI has begun an internship program with ten students currently working as interns on a variety of research projects at NASA Ames. Each student is partnered with a NASA scientist who serves as his or her mentor and oversees the internship. Students range in academic level from high school to third-year Ph.D. candidates and come from a variety of institutions throughout the region.</p><p>The natural alignment between UCSC's strengths in science and engineering and NASA Ames's research mission is yielding benefits for both partners in the UARC, Berry said. A similar alignment with the interests of Silicon Valley industry is leading to growing ties between UCSC and leading Silicon Valley companies. The UARC is playing an important role in building industry relationships for UCSC, in concert with a new academic program in Information Systems and Technology Management (ISTM), Berry said. </p><p>ISTM is an interdisciplinary field at the nexus of engineering and business management, and the ISTM program will eventually be a new department in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. ISTM faculty have offices on campus and at UCSC's Silicon Valley facilities. The graduate program, as well as some upper-division courses for undergraduates, will be based in Silicon Valley, said Ram Akella, professor and director of ISTM. </p><p>"Our laboratories are the high-tech industries. We are like anthropologists, only the tribes we study are here in Silicon Valley," Akella said. "We look at issues such as supply chain management, new product development, and how you can use information technology to improve the way companies do business."</p><p>Akella has worked extensively with the semiconductor industry, U.S. software companies, and many other companies in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. He said the ISTM program at UCSC is unlike any other program in the country. </p><p>"Engineering schools don't teach management, and management schools don't teach engineering. We combine everything, and that's what makes it unique," Akella said. </p><p>Two new faculty are joining the program this year, and Akella said he is using his connections with Silicon Valley industry and NASA Ames to bring in industry professionals to help teach courses and as adjunct faculty. </p><p>"The talent pool is tremendous, and everyone is very excited about UCSC's Silicon Valley Initiative," he said.  </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact William Berry at (650) 604-0511 or wberry@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e0e498072704601a012ffd842d9de"><name>562</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: Former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt will meet with reporters prior to his lecture at UCSC on October 5</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1096354800000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: Former Interior...</display-name><path>/2004/09/562</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/562</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338065948</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338065948</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In response to requests from reporters, former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has agreed to be available to answer reporters' questions in advance of his lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday, October 5.</p><p>Who:</p><p>Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, 1993 to 2001</p><p>	</p><p>What:</p><p>In response to requests from reporters, Bruce Babbitt has agreed to be available to answer reporters' questions in advance of his lecture at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>When:</p><p>3 to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, October 5</p><p>Where: </p><p>UCSC Academic Resources Center (ARCenter), Room 206</p><p>Details:</p><p>Babbitt, who served for eight years as secretary of the interior during the Clinton administration, will give the inaugural Fred Keeley Lecture on Environmental Policy at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday, October 5.

MacArthur Foundation. DeRisi, 35, will receive $500,000 in "no strings attached" support over the next five years.</p><p>DeRisi, who received his B.S. in biochemistry and molecular biology from UCSC in 1992, is developing the means to measure thousands of genes simultaneously in an effort to decode the mysteries of cellular function. He was recently profiled in the Spring 2004 issue of the UC Santa Cruz Review magazine (<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring04/alumni_profile.html">profile</a>).</p><p>The MacArthur Fellows are selected for their originality, creativity, and the potential to do more in the future. DeRisi is the fifth graduate of UCSC to receive the award. The MacArthur Fellows Program places no restrictions on how recipients may use the $500,000, and no reports are required. </p><p>"The new MacArthur Fellows illustrate the foundation's conviction that talented individuals, free to follow their insights and instincts, will make a difference in shaping the future," said Jonathan F. Fanton, president of the MacArthur Foundation.</p><p>A molecular biologist, DeRisi develops and uses new technologies for exploring the complex, interdependent pathways regulating gene expression. He is extending the impact of recent advances in DNA sequencing by examining not just the population of genes within a cell, but also their interactions that lead to complex behaviors. </p><p>DeRisi uses glass slides, carefully prepared with spots of DNA, arranged by robotic devices in a microarray, to make hundreds and even thousands of measurements of individual gene expression from a single experimental sample. His studies on the most common type of malaria parasite have revealed an unusual pattern of synchronized gene activity. This observation suggests that the infectious agent may be particularly sensitive to drugs that disrupt the gene synchronization necessary to move into the next phase of its life cycle. </p><p>DeRisi has also demonstrated the power of microarrays for rapid characterization of unknown viral strains; he and colleagues used this method to identify and characterize a novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in early 2003. By enhancing methods for bulk measurement of gene activity and applying this technology to questions of vital biological and medical interest, DeRisi demonstrates the vast potential for discoveries in molecular genetics to decode the mysteries of cellular function and to advance the diagnosis and treatment of disease.</p><p>After receiving his bachelor's degree from UCSC, DeRisi earned a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1999. He was a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF before joining the faculty there. His research has been published in such academic journals as Science, Nature Medicine, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, and PLoS Biology.</p><p>_____</p><p>DeRisi is the seventh person affiliated with UC Santa Cruz to receive a MacArthur Fellowship. The others are Shelly Errington, professor of anthropology; Ali Akbar Khan, distinguished adjunct professor of music; Ph.D. graduates Alfred Jay Cantor (history of consciousness) and Robert Shaw (physics); and bachelor's graduates Patricia Nelson Limerick (American studies) and Richard White (history).</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e11518072704601a012ff4212d50d"><name>564</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fourth annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture/Film Screening set for October 17 at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1096527600000</start-date><display-name>Fourth annual Sidhartha Maitra...</display-name><path>/2004/09/564</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/564</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338066700</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338066700</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCLA emeritus professor and renowned ethnomusicologist Nazir Jairazbhoy will be the featured speaker at the fourth annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture set for October 17 at 5:30 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>Known as the "father of Indian Ethnomusicology" in the United States, Jairazbhoy has conducted extensive research on India's classical and folk music. He will speak on the topic: "From Music Room to Talk Room." Following the lecture, there will a live Thumri vocal recital featuring acclaimed Indian vocalist Purnima Chaudhuri, with Uttam Chakraborty on tabla, from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m.. </p><p>The lecture and concert will be preceded at 3 p.m. by a screening of the classic 1958 Satyajit Ray film, The Music Room (Jalsaghar). An exhibition of Ray's storyboards, set and costume designs, posters, and graphic art will also be featured at an Opening Reception between 1 and 3 p.m. at the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery at Cowell College. All events are free and open to the public. </p><p>The 2004 Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture will be presented by the university's Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection as part of UCSC's 40th anniversary celebration. The lecture series was established in 2001 by Anuradha Luther Maitra in honor of her husband, who was a scientist, entrepreneur, and admirer of the late Indian film director's work. The Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection (Ray FASC) was founded in 1993 to acquire, preserve, and provide scholarly access to Ray's films, papers, books, and artwork.</p><p>The Maitras have provided endowments to support both Ray FASC and the study of Indian classical music. Anu Maitra planned this year's event to honor the fortuitous intersection of her husband's twin passions. She said, "I came away from a recent screening of Jalsaghar with a crusading reverence for Ray's craftsmanship and gratitude to him for having preserved, for all time, sparkling performances from the masters of Indian music and dance--Bismillah Khan, Begum Akhtar, Waheed Khan, and Roshan Kumari." </p><p>Dilip Basu, associate professor of history and director of Ray FASC at UCSC, noted that plans are being made to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ray's work with a festival of his restored films in Calcutta on December 10-16. Invited guests include Sonia Gandhi; Somnath Chatterjee, speaker of the Indian Parliament and president of The Ray Society; Frank Pearson, president of the Academy of Motion Pictures; M. Fremeaux, artistic director of the Cannes Film Festival; Salman Rushdie; and Tom Luddy, producer of Coppola's Zoetrope Films and director of the Telluride Film Festival.</p><p>Basu said that the festival will then travel to Bangalore and Delhi in January and March, adding that Ray's Pather Panchali and the Apu Trilogy, along with France's favorite Ray film, The Music Room, will be re-screened at Cannes and New York's Museum of Modern Art in May. Later that month, Pather Panchali  and the Apu Trilogy will also be screened at a fundraising banquet in Silicon Valley.</p><p>					</p><p>"At the Silicon Valley banquet, we plan to assemble distinguished academics, university presidents and chancellors, Silicon Valley professionals, and Hollywood directors and actors," said Basu. "We hope President Bill Clinton, a Ray film fan, will attend the banquet as well."</p><p>For more information, call (831) 459-4012 or visit <a href="http://satyajitray.ucsc.edu">satyajitray.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e13078072704601a012ffdc833e34"><name>565</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum, now in its 40th year, holds annual fall plant sale on Saturday, October 9</title><author>Stephen McCabe (831) 427-2998, smccabe@ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1096527600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Arboretum, now in...</display-name><path>/2004/09/565</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/565</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338067130</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338067130</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In the fall of 1964, one year before the first class of students entered the University of California, Santa Cruz, the first trees were planted in the UCSC Arboretum. Some of those plantings have since grown into the graceful trees of the Eucalyptus Grove, where the Arboretum's plant sales are now held. And the Arboretum itself has grown over the past 40 years into the premier botanical garden of the Central Coast, with renowned collections of plants from California and around the world. </p><p>The Arboretum's Fall Plant Sale, featuring colorful plants chosen for the Central Coast region, will be held this year on Saturday, October 9, from 12 to 4 p.m. Many of the plants that will be on sale are from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and are rarely available in the United States. California natives will also be available, including some old favorites and a new introduction--a striking manzanita from Santa Cruz Island. A complete list of the plants that will be offered at the sale will be available on the web after October 1 at <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">arboretum.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p>As in previous years, the Arboretum's plant sale is a joint event with the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). For Arboretum and CNPS members only, the sale starts at 10 a.m. It will take place at the Eucalyptus Grove on High Street at the intersection with Western Drive.</p><p>Some of the more exotic highlights of the sale are dramatic, otherworldly specimen plants like South African Leucadendron selections with deep red foliage and Australian banksias with huge cone-like flower clusters. Though they are members of the protea family, several of the banksias and the Leucadendron salignum hybrids are easier to grow than other members of this family. Some of the banksias have heather-like leaves and others have very long, saw-like leaf edges. Flower colors include shades of red and yellow, yellow-green, and maroon fading to yellow. </p><p>A vibrant, green-leaved manzanita that is being sold for the first time ever is Arctostaphylos insularis "Ward." Arboretum curator Stephen McCabe, who collected a cutting of this plant on Santa Cruz Island in 1991, said he was looking for a plant that would look lush in a dry garden to contrast with other plants with silver and gray foliage. It caught his eye because it was the "most vibrant-looking manzanita in the dry chaparral," he said. McCabe named the plant after his late father, Ward McCabe, an Episcopal priest with a passionate devotion to furthering the causes of political, social, and economic justice. </p><p>Arctostaphylos insularis "Ward" grows to around six to 10 feet tall and has beautiful mahogany bark and broad, shiny, bright-green leaves. From late winter into spring, loose clusters of pendant, white to pale-pink flowers cover the shrub. It requires good drainage and sun in coastal locations and light shade in inland areas.  </p><p>Manzanitas and other California natives--including toyon, madrone, and evergreen currant (Ribes viburnifolium)--create habitat and provide food for birds. To provide late-summer and fall color as well as nectar for hummingbirds, plant California fuchsia (Epilobium canum). In the spring, columbine (Aquilegia formosa) will also attract hummingbirds.</p><p>The UCSC Arboretum is open for visitors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesday through Sunday from 12 to 3 p.m. For more information, call (831) 427-2998.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915316d18072704601a012ffe871f9e9"><name>1575</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fourteen new 'blue light' emergency phones installed</title><summary>Fourteen new "blue light" emergency phones were installed on campus this summer, primarily in four large parking lots.</summary><keywords>emergency, phones</keywords><description>Fourteen new "blue light" emergency phones were installed on campus this summer, primarily in four large parking lots.</description><start-date>1095663600000</start-date><display-name>Fourteen new 'blue light'...</display-name><path>/2004/09/1575</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/1575</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338395797</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338395797</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Fourteen new "blue light" emergency phones were installed on campus this summer, primarily in four large parking lots. The new phones, easily identified by their tall rectangular shape, are part of an ongoing effort to improve the safety and security of students, faculty, and staff--especially those who are on campus during evenings and weekends. The new phones bring the total number of blue light phones on campus to 54.</p><p>Each large parking lot (West Remote, North Remote, Hahn, and East Remote) now has three new blue light phones, located at the entrance, center, and back of each lot. In addition, there are phones at the Cowell bus stop (near Quarry Plaza) and the Oakes bus stop (near the lower College Eight parking lot). The Core West Parking Structure has three older style emergency phones on each parking level, at the east and west ends, as well as at the middle stairwell near Baskin Engineering.) </p><p>An <a href="http://emergency.ucsc.edu">online map</a> of the new locations is now available at the campus emergency web site.</p><p>The phones are activated by pressing the large "emergency" button; the caller will be automatically connected to the campus Dispatch Center. At the same time, a high-intensity strobe light at the top of the phone will activate, providing a beacon for police officers to locate the person in distress. </p><p>For more information about emergency procedures on campus, visit <a href="emergency.ucsc.edu">emergency.ucsc.edu</a> or contact Chris Gaylord at (831) 459-2342.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27dd49a8072704601a012ff62409a88"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626409580</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626409580</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><system-folder id="3c71303d8072701704be48b5ea843947"><name>images</name><is-published>true</is-published><title>images</title><display-name>images</display-name><path>/2004/09/images</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/images</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1452712996861</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1452712996861</last-modified></system-folder><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27dd49a8072704601a012ff62409a88"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/09/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626409580</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626409580</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
