This theory, known as the Standard Model and hailed as one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century, is still only understood and appreciated by a limited number of people who tend to have advanced science degrees. Physicist Bruce Schumm hopes to change that with his new book, Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics. </p><p> </p><p>Schumm, a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said he was determined to make his book accessible to any interested reader without watering down the science. In Deep Down Things, he takes the reader on a fascinating journey into the bizarre, subatomic world of particle physics. </p><p> </p><p>The path at times requires close attention, but Schumm is a witty and eloquent guide, offering patient explanations and helpful analogies, as well as candid acknowledgment of concepts that remain mysterious even to scientists. Ultimately, the reader is rewarded with a view of the fundamental nature of the world as physicists see it and a sense of how strange and counterintuitive, yet scientifically sound, that view is. </p><p> </p><p>Though certainly not the first popular book about particle physics, Deep Down Things seems to be the only one to offer a clear, straightforward explanation of the field's current paradigm without veering off into the realm of speculation or spirituality. Schumm, who has spent his career deeply involved in particle physics research, said there is plenty of material in the science itself to inspire wonder and awe. </p><p> </p><p>"Ever since the development of relativity and quantum mechanics, science has come to have increasingly wondrous and jarring metaphysical implications," Schumm said. "We know that there is a lot more to the universe than meets the eye, and some of what we know scientifically is exceedingly mysterious from a philosophical point of view. But you don't need to go outside of the science to find that sense of wonder and mystery."</p><p> </p><p>One does, however, need to make an effort to understand the science in order to recognize where scientific understanding ends and speculative fantasy or spirituality begins, he said. That line gets blurred, for example, in the recent movie What the Bleep Do We Know?!, which takes quantum physics as its starting point and goes well beyond what scientists believe to be true, according to Schumm. </p><p> </p><p>The mathematical underpinnings of physics have long been perceived as an insurmountable barrier preventing the uninitiated from grasping the science on anything other than a superficial level. But Schumm's approach is primarily descriptive and does not require a strong background in mathematics. He presents a few important equations "to demystify them, and just because they are interesting," he said, but the equations are always described in nonmathematical terms. </p><p> </p><p>Nevertheless, the role of mathematics in particle physics is a story Schumm is eager to tell. Much of the book focuses on the remarkable connection between abstract mathematical theory and the physical sciences, explaining how certain arcane results derived by mathematical theorists turn out to be essential to the description of nature at its most fundamental level. </p><p> </p><p>"The connection between abstract mathematics and the physical nature of the world has always stunned me, and the beauty of that is something I wanted to convey," he said. </p><p> </p><p>To Schumm, this relationship is one of the most beautiful and profound revelations of the modern era. In Deep Down Things, he gives readers with no specialized knowledge an opportunity to appreciate that beauty and profundity for themselves. </p><p> </p><p>"I realized that nobody had written an exposition of the Standard Model for the nonexpert, and it seemed like an obligation of the field to give back to society the results of this research," he said. </p><p> </p><p>The book concludes with a look at the unanswered questions that physicists will be exploring in the years ahead.</p><p> </p><p>Schumm, who joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1995, is affiliated with the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics at UCSC. He is involved in particle physics experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and has also been involved in planning and design work for a next-generation linear collider facility. He received a 2002-03 Excellence in Teaching Award from the UCSC Academic Senate. Schumm earned a B.A. in physics and mathematics from Haverford College and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Schumm at (831) 459-3034 or schumm@scipp.ucsc.edu.</p><p>For review copies, contact Tim Stephens in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4352 or stephens@ucsc.edu; or Mary Sestric, publicist, Johns Hopkins University Press, at </p><p>(410) 516-6939 or msestric@press.jhu.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e53728072704601a012ffde3d5e7d"><name>606</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Regents will meet Tuesday to consider appointment of new chancellor of UCSC</title><author>University of California Office of the President; (510) 987-9200</author><start-date>1102662000000</start-date><display-name>UC Regents will meet...</display-name><path>/2004/12/606</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/12/606</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338083634</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338083634</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This is a Notice of a Special Meeting of the University of California Board of Regents on Tuesday, Dec. 14, 2004, to consider the appointment and compensation for a new chancellor of the Santa Cruz campus.

A "virtual white cane" is one of several prototype tools for the visually impaired developed by Roberto Manduchi, an assistant professor of computer engineering, and his students. </p><p>The traditional white cane is still the  most common mobility device for the blind. It is a simple and effective tool that enables users to extend their sense of touch and "preview" the area ahead of them as they walk. But the long, rigid cane is not well-suited to all situations or all users.</p><p>Manduchi's high-tech alternative is a laser-based range-sensing device about the size of a flashlight. A laser, much like the one in an ordinary laser pointer, is combined with a digital camera and a computer processor that analyzes and integrates spatial information as the user moves the device back and forth over a scene. The user receives feedback about the scene in the form of audio signals, and an additional tactile interface is being developed for future prototypes.</p><p>"In the audio signal, the pitch corresponds to distance, and there are also special sounds to indicate features such as a curb, step, or drop-off," Manduchi said.</p><p>Dan Yuan, a graduate student working with Manduchi on the virtual white cane project, built the initial prototype. The UCSC researchers are collaborating with the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, a nonprofit research institute in San Francisco (<a href="http://www.ski.org">www.ski.org</a>), on the virtual white cane and other projects. </p><p>"The people at Smith-Kettlewell are helping us to understand the real needs of the blind, and they have blind engineers who test the systems we develop," Manduchi said.</p><p>In another project, for example, Manduchi is working with Smith-Kettlewell scientist James Coughlan on a system that uses a compact device with a camera to detect and gather information from small labels or tags placed in key locations. For example, the tags might help a blind person locate a doctor's office in a medical building. The device would only work where tags have been placed in the environment, but the tags--small colored labels with bar codes on them--are very inexpensive and require no maintenance. </p><p>"A blind person staying at a hotel could put a sticker on their door so they could easily find their way back to the room," Manduchi said. "Or I could put tags here in the Engineering 2 Building to help a blind visitor find my office."</p><p>The tags could be detected by a handheld computer with a simple camera, or even a camera phone, he said. Michi Mutsuzaki, a UCSC undergraduate working in Manduchi's lab, used a small handheld computer with a camera to develop a protoype device that can detect the colored targets. </p><p>A third collaboration with Smith-Kettlewell is a project Manduchi refers to as "MapQuest for the blind," in reference to the Internet map site MapQuest.com. </p><p>"The problem is how to enable a blind person to explore a map," Manduchi said. "The current devices are braille maps, but those require a special printer. We want to create a feedback environment to enable a blind person to explore a map on the computer."</p><p> The feedback would be provided by a "force-feedback mouse," which vibrates to produce a variety of physical sensations the user can feel as the pointer moves across features on a computer screen. These devices are readily available, so the project involves creating software that will enable the blind to use a force-feedback mouse to "feel" their way through a map. </p><p>Michele Clarke, an undergraduate at St. Mary's University of Minnesota, began working with Manduchi on this project last summer as a participant in UCSC's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Information Technology (SURF-IT) program, funded by the National Science Foundation. She is continuing to work on the project at St. Mary's during the current academic year. </p><p>Before coming to UC Santa Cruz in 2001, Manduchi worked for several years at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, applying computer vision technology to autonomous robotic systems.</p><p>"It is a natural evolution from helping a robot drive around to helping a blind person navigate their environment," he said. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Manduchi at (831) 459-1479 or manduchi@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e569a8072704601a012ff349cd4fe"><name>609</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees welcomes new members</title><author>Louise Donahue (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1102921200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Foundation...</display-name><path>/2004/12/609</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/12/609</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338084452</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338084452</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Six individuals, including distinguished philanthropists, community volunteers, and leaders in a variety of fields, have joined the UCSC Foundation Board of Trustees.

She replaces M.R.C. Greenwood, who was appointed UC provost and senior vice president of academic affairs last February. Martin M. Chemers, provost and executive vice chancellor of the Santa Cruz campus, has been serving as acting UCSC chancellor during the search for a new permanent chancellor. Chemers will remain acting chancellor until Denton takes office.<br/>
<br/>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz is a campus on the move, and Denice Denton brings the perfect skills and credentials to build on the momentum that has been created by Provost Greenwood and Acting Chancellor Chemers," said Dynes. "She is an accomplished scholar, an energetic and articulate advocate about the role and importance of education in our society, and a skillful and innovative administrator who understands the increasingly important role UC Santa Cruz plays in the Silicon Valley economy and beyond."</p>
<p>Denton, 45, emerged as Dynes' top choice for the position after a national search that produced more than 700 prospects. The president was advised by a committee representing regents; faculty, students, staff, and alumni of UCSC; and the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored by this appointment, and I am very excited to be joining the University of California and the UC Santa Cruz community in particular," Denton said. "The campus's expanding international reputation for academic excellence is a testament to the work of its outstanding students and faculty. I am eager to begin working with them, as well as with the dedicated staff, alumni, neighbors and friends of UC Santa Cruz, to continue the progress that has been made and to take on the exciting challenges that lie ahead."</p>
<p>Denton holds four degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, including a Ph.D. As dean of engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, Denton directs an organization with 10 departments, 17 centers, 225 faculty members and an annual operating budget of $155 million.</p>
<p>"I am impressed by UCSC's tradition of pioneering, interdisciplinary research, and in particular the interesting new fields of research that are emerging from the intersection of disciplines," Denton said. "I look forward to supporting the faculty's innovative spirit and leading-edge work."</p>
<p>She went to UW in 1996 from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where she had spent the previous nine years as a faculty member in electrical and computer engineering. By accepting the deanship at UW, she became the first woman in the nation to lead an engineering college at a major research university.</p>
<p>Greenwood, UC Provost and UC Santa Cruz's most recent chancellor, praised the selection of Denton.</p>
<p>"I accepted the Provost position knowing that Santa Cruz had a strong leadership team, led by Marty Chemers," said Greenwood. "I am tremendously proud of the campus' many incredible accomplishments and I am confident that its strong upward trajectory will be further enhanced with the appointment of Denice Denton as chancellor."</p>
<p>During her tenure at the UW, she has been instrumental in establishing and promoting multiple programs that seek to make engineering accessible to segments of the population that traditionally don't see themselves as having a chance to pursue science-related careers.</p>
<p>In May 2004, Denton was among nine scholars honored by the White House with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, recognizing her role as a national leader in enhancing diversity in science and engineering. For more about her award: <a href="http://www.uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=4279">www.uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=4279</a>.</p>
<p>At Wisconsin, she co-directed the National Institute for Science Education, a National Science Foundation-funded initiative to improve mathematics and science education from kindergarten through higher education. She also directed a program aimed at enhancing the quality of undergraduate instruction in manufacturing engineering and increasing the diversity of the undergraduate engineering population.</p>
<p>In addition, Denton chaired the executive committee of the Faculty Division of Physical Sciences at Wisconsin, which governs educational policy in a division of more than 530 faculty members.</p>
<p>Denton also has served as chair or member of numerous national committees and boards. She has received a number of teaching awards and was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2000 and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 2004.</p>
<p>Denton was born in El Campo, Texas. She lives with her partner of seven years, Gretchen Kalonji, Kyocera Professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Washington. In her spare time, Denton enjoys taking her two dogs to the beach, sea kayaking, and world travel.</p>

The nerves severed by this precision technique regrew within 24 hours, often with complete recovery of function. </p><p>The project was a collaboration between applied physics researchers at Stanford University led by Adela Ben-Yakar and biologists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, led by Yishi Jin and Andrew Chisholm.</p><p>The team's findings give researchers an experimental system in which they will be able to investigate in great detail the genetic and molecular factors that control whether or not damaged nerves can regrow, said Chisholm, an associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC. </p><p>"This technique will enable us to find the genes that are important in allowing an axon to regenerate. In the worm, we can do systematic screening of large numbers of genes, and of drugs and other small molecules as well, to ask how they affect the process of regeneration," Chisholm said. </p><p>The researchers reported their findings in a paper published in the December 16 issue of the journal Nature. The first author of the paper is Mehmet Fatih Yanik, a Stanford graduate student in applied physics, who worked with Ben-Yakar in her femtosecond laser nanosurgery project. Ben-Yakar initiated the project two years ago at Stanford and is continuing it as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. The other coauthors include Jin, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; Hulusi Cinar, a postdoctoral researcher in Jin's lab; and Hediye Nese Cinar, a postdoc in Chisholm's lab. </p><p>The Cinars met Yanik through personal connections and initially discussed possible collaboration about a year ago. Yanik later told them about the femtosecond laser and how other researchers had begun using it in biological systems to surgically destroy extremely tiny structures. </p><p>"When Yanik described to me what this instrument can do, I immediately thought of my work on the nervous system of C. elegans and came up with a nerve regeneration experiment we could do together, and I  designed the experiments," said Hulusi Cinar. </p><p>Yanik performed the nanosurgery procedure at Stanford. The technique uses extremely short pulses of intense laser light to focus energy in a very small volume. When properly focused, the energy delivered by the laser pulses breaks down chemical bonds at the targeted site, vaporizing the tissue within a tiny volume without causing side effects such as heating of surrounding tissue, Yanik said. </p><p>The duration of the laser pulses used in the study was 200 femtoseconds (a femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second), and the pulses were delivered at a rate of one thousand per second. The delicate axons severed by the procedure, with no apparent damage to surrounding tissue, were on average just 0.3 microns, or 300 nanometers, in diameter (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). </p><p>"I am very excited about the merging of this new technology into biological research. I didn't know anything about femtosecond laser technology until the physicists explained it to me," said Jin, who has spent years investigating the development of the worm's nervous system. "Now there is a lot to do--it has opened up the potential to address questions that we have never been able to address before." </p><p>In their experiments, the researchers cut a nerve that runs from one side of the worm's body to the other. The nerve inhibits contraction of muscles on one side of the body while the muscles on the other side are contracting. It functions during the alternating contractions of muscles on either side of the body that enable the worm to wiggle backward with a smooth wavelike motion. Hulusi Cinar and Jin have been studying so-called "shrinker" mutants that lack this ability due to a genetic defect.</p><p>"A normal worm, when you touch its head, will move backward in a smooth motion. In the shrinker mutants, the muscles on both sides contract simultaneously, so they don't move back," Cinar said. "So these neurons were a good target for surgery because we knew that when they are knocked out you get a well-defined behavioral effect, and it's straightforward to see if their function has been recovered through regeneration." </p><p>Nese Cinar designed a movement assay to evaluate the behavioral effects in the worms and evaluated the worms in the experiments in a "blinded" manner, not knowing which ones had received the surgery. </p><p>"Without such functional assays, any anatomically observed regeneration could be explained in various ways, such as bleaching and recovery of the marker protein used to label the neurons," she said.</p><p>The nanosurgery, performed on anesthetized juvenile worms, could be completed in about 10 minutes per worm once the equipment was set up. Although regeneration of peripheral nerves is nothing new, Chisholm said he was still surprised by the rapid recovery of function in the worms. Most of the severed axons regrew within 12 to 24 hours after the laser surgery. Preliminary observations indicated that after an axon is cut, the nerve cell sprouts a new axon from the severed end that regrows to reach the target muscle. In some cases, however, it appears that the two severed ends reattach, Chisholm said.</p><p>"Clearly there is a lot more biology going on here that we need to explore. This just opens up a lot of exciting things to study," he said.</p><p>C. elegans, an almost microscopic nematode or roundworm, has become an extremely important system for biomedical research. Geneticists have identified thousands of genes in the worm that have counterparts in humans. A relatively simple organism with a short generation time, reproducing in just three days, it is easy to study in the laboratory. It has many of the same basic physiological and anatomical features, such as muscles and nerves, found in more complex animals. And it is even transparent, making it easy to see things like nerves inside its body. The researchers who pioneered the use of C. elegans for biomedical research received the 2002 Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine. </p><p>Now this excellent model system for biomedical research is available for studying nerve regeneration. One of the fundamental questions researchers want to answer is why nerve damage in the central nervous system--the brain and spinal cord--is usually permanent.</p><p>"In humans, peripheral nerves will regrow, but in the central nervous system the regrowth of axons is inhibited by the local environment. That's why spinal cord injuries are so serious. We want to find out why a severed axon will regrow in some situations and not in others," Chisholm said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Chisholm at (831) 459-5720 or chisholm@biology.ucsc.edu; Jin at (831) 459-5721 or jin@biology.ucsc.edu; Ben-Yakar at (512) 475-9280 or ben-yakar@mail.utexas.edu; Yanik at fatih@stanford.edu; Hulusi Cinar at hcinar@biology.ucsc.edu; and Nese Cinar at cinar@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e5f938072704601a012ff02df6b8f"><name>615</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>$200,000 gift to UCSC establishes graduate fellowship in marine mammals</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1103094000000</start-date><display-name>$200,000 gift to UCSC...</display-name><path>/2004/12/615</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/12/615</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338086725</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338086725</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A gift of $200,000 from Rebecca and Steve Sooy of Foster City has established an endowed fellowship fund to support graduate students studying marine mammals at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>The Sooys have been volunteer docents at Año Nuevo State Reserve for many years, where they became fascinated by the northern elephant seals that breed there. The Rebecca and Steve Sooy Graduate Fellowship in Marine Mammals celebrates and continues their long commitment to the understanding and conservation of the northern elephant seal by encouraging and supporting marine mammal research. The fellowship will be open to any graduate student studying marine mammals at UC Santa Cruz, with primary consideration given to students investigating the northern elephant seal. </p><p>UCSC is one of the top centers for marine mammal research in the world. The campus has a unique combination of field and laboratory facilities for marine mammal research, including animal holding facilities at Long Marine Laboratory and ready access to natural populations of elephant seals, harbor seals, California sea lions, and Steller sea lions at UC's Año Nuevo Reserve. In addition, UCSC is located on the shores of Monterey Bay, a biologically rich marine environment with one of the highest diversities of marine mammals in the world, including many different species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises.</p><p>UCSC has probably the most active and productive graduate program in marine mammal biology of any university in the world, according to Daniel Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. Graduates of this program have gone on to prominent positions in academia, federal and state government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. </p><p>"The quality of our graduate students is legendary, as our students have consistently won top honors at the Biennial Conference for Marine Mammalogy," Costa said.</p><p>But he added that finding support for graduate students is becoming increasingly difficult and problematic due to increases in tuition and fees and declining state support for higher education. </p><p>"We are finding it increasingly difficult to compete for the best and brightest students due to a lack of graduate student support. The Rebecca and Steve Sooy Graduate Fellowship in Marine Mammals will go a long way toward solving this problem," Costa said. </p><p>The history of marine mammal expertise at UCSC extends back to the campus's earliest years, starting with pioneering researcher Richard Peterson, who was later joined on the UCSC faculty by Burney Le Boeuf and Kenneth Norris. Le Boeuf, now a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology and associate vice chancellor for research, and Peterson studied primarily pinnipeds (seals and sea lions), while Norris was already internationally renowned for his research on cetaceans (dolphins and whales). </p><p>Marine mammal researchers at UCSC now cover an ever-widening range of expertise. They include Costa, who studies the physiological ecology of marine mammals, with a special emphasis on elephant seals; Donald Croll, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who has been studying the relationship of oceanography to the foraging ecology of large whales; James Estes, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who is known internationally for his work on the role of sea otters in kelp forest communities and, more generally, the role of top predators in marine communities; Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who studies marine mammal locomotion and energetics; research biologist Stephen Insley, who studies acoustic ecology; and research biologists Colleen and Dave Kastak, who study the sensory ecology and physiology of marine mammals. </p><p>The Rebecca and Steve Sooy Graduate Fellowship in Marine Mammals will be administered by the Graduate Division, with the selection of fellows made in cooperation with the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e610c8072704601a012ff9a652244"><name>616</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor reappointed to water quality board</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1103007600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz professor...</display-name><path>/2004/12/616</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/12/616</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338087130</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338087130</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been reappointed by Gov.

Admission is free.</p><p>Franzen won the National Book Award for The Corrections, perhaps the most-written-about novel of 2001. He is also the author of two other works of fiction-The Twenty-Seventh City (1988) and Strong Motion (1992), as well as a collection of essays titled How to Be Alone (2002) that includes an account of his brief tenure as an author for Oprah Winfrey's book club. </p><p>Franzen's honors include the American Academy's Berlin Prize in 2000 and a Whiting Writers' Award in 1988. He was also named one of "Twenty Writers for the 21st Century" by The New Yorker and one of the "Best Young American Novelists" by Granta. Franzen will speak about contemporary fiction writing in his talk, entitled "What Makes You Think You're Not the Evil One Himself?" </p><p>The UCSC and Santa Cruz library support groups have been sponsoring a joint author/artist series for the past decade. Previous guest speakers have included Janet Fitch, author of White Oleander, Santa Cruz mystery writer Laurie R. King, and William Rubel, local food expert and publisher of the children's magazine Stone Soup. </p><p>"We find the speakers and produce posters, and they provide the community room at the main branch downtown and refreshments," explained Liz Sandoval, staff liaison for Friends of the UCSC Library. "This collaboration allows us to bring our program into the community in a convenient downtown location." </p><p>"Our Friends programming budget has always necessarily supported programs just for children and young adults," added Pat Sandidge, managing director of Friends of the Santa Cruz Public Libraries. "We are very grateful for the collaboration with the UCSC Friends because it has allowed us to expand program support to include very successful, entertaining, and stimulating adult programming." </p><p>The two groups usually present two free lectures at the downtown library during the winter months. Book artists Peter and Donna Thomas will speak about fine printing and the literary book as a work of art on Thursday, February 17, at 7 p.m. Their lecture is billed as "The Artist Book: Four Dimensional Art."</p><p>"We are thrilled to have such an internationally recognized, award-winning author as Jonathan Franzen participate," Sandoval noted. "He has personal connections in Santa Cruz and has generously agreed to take time to speak for our Friends groups this year."</p><p>For more information contact Liz Sandoval of Friends of the UCSC Library at (831) 459-5870, lsand@ucsc.edu.

The program integrates presentations on research, policy, practice, and technology. The symposium includes distinguished keynote addresses, featured speakers, pre-conference workshops, and 64 concurrent sessions. In addition to educational and networking opportunities, the symposium bookstore offers a selection of publications authored and suggested by presenters and New Teacher Center (NTC) staff.</p><p>More than 700 mentor teachers, professional developers, induction program coordinators, administrators, teacher educators, researchers, and policy makers from across the country will attend the pre-conference and two-day symposium. These educators recognize the importance of supporting their newest colleagues. </p><p>"Our annual symposium provides a forum for educational leaders to come together to create a new vision for the teaching profession, and to consider how induction systems and mentoring practices can move our schools and classroom practices towards equity and excellence," said NTC Director Ellen Moir. "Our work in teacher induction has the power to create ever-expanding ripples that can change the tide."</p><p>The NTC is a national resource center dedicated to teacher development and the support of programs and practices that promote excellence and diversity in our teaching force. The center is committed to creating professional environments for all teachers that encourage high pedagogical standards and opportunities for collaborative learning. The NTC is currently working in 31 states to design and implement systematic teacher induction programs focused on teacher quality, classroom instruction, and student achievement. In addition, NTC's work with researchers and policy makers is identifying ways to make teacher learning a centerpiece of school reform. </p><p>	</p><p>For complete information on the center and the symposium, please visit <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org">www.newteachercenter.org</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e65d88072704601a012ff5c1eb09e"><name>619</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>An unusual RNA structure in the SARS virus offers a promising target for antiviral drugs</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1104217200000</start-date><display-name>An unusual RNA structure...</display-name><path>/2004/12/619</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/12/619</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338088344</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338088344</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Research on the genome of the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has revealed an unusual molecular structure that looks like a promising target for antiviral drugs. A team of scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has determined the three-dimensional shape of this structure, an intricately twisted and folded segment of RNA. Their findings suggest that it may help the virus hijack the protein-building machinery of infected cells.</p><p>The SARS virus is a type of RNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is RNA rather than the more familiar DNA found in the chromosomes of everything from bacteria to humans. All RNA viruses have relatively high mutation rates, making their genomes highly variable. In HIV, for example, this high rate of mutation contributes to the rapid appearance of drug-resistant strains of the virus. In SARS and related viruses, however, one segment of the RNA genome--known as the s2m RNA--remains virtually unchanged.</p><p>"Because viral evolution has not been able to tamper with this sequence, it is clear that it must be of vital importance to the viruses that have it, but no one knows exactly what its function is," said William Scott, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>Scott's lab used the technique of x-ray crystallography to solve the structure of this RNA element with nearly atomic resolution, revealing where every one of the many thousands of atoms that make up the structure is situated. The results showed several unique and interesting features of the s2m RNA, including a distinctive fold that appears to be capable of binding to certain proteins involved in regulating protein synthesis in cells.</p><p>"The structure gives us strong hints about the function, because it forms a fold that has been implicated in binding a certain class of proteins," Scott said. "The structure itself also provides a starting point for designing antiviral drugs that might bind to this RNA and prevent it from doing whatever it is that is vital to the life cycle of the virus."</p><p>The UCSC researchers are publishing their findings in the journal PLoS Biology (www.plosbiology.org, Volume 3, Issue 1). The first author of the paper is Michael Robertson, a postdoctoral researcher in Scott's lab. Robertson and Scott purified large amounts of s2m RNA, crystallized it, bombarded the crystals with x-rays, and determined the structure from the resulting pattern of x-ray scattering.</p><p>The other coauthors, in addition to Scott, are Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) professor; Haller Igel, a research associate in the Ares lab; David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a HHMI investigator; and Robert Baertsch, a graduate student working with Haussler. </p><p>All of the authors are affiliated with UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA. The strong interdisciplinary connections within the RNA center were a key to making the project possible, Scott said. The investigation brought together bioinformatics experts Baertsch and Haussler, who performed the computational sequence analysis of the genomes of SARS and related viruses; molecular biologists Igel and Ares, who cloned and chemically characterized the s2m RNA; and RNA crystallography experts Robertson and Scott. </p><p>"It's true that exciting discoveries are often made at the interfaces between disciplines, but it's rare that you see it happening in such a vivid way. This is a great example of interdisciplinary science at work," said Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at UCSC and director of the RNA center.</p><p>Different types of RNA perform a variety of critical tasks in all living cells. Messenger RNA is the intermediary that carries genetic information from the DNA in the chromosomes to the cellular protein factories, called ribosomes, where the genetic information is translated into proteins. The ribosomes themselves are made primarily of ribosomal RNA. </p><p>The SARS s2m RNA is in an untranslated section at one end of each of the messenger RNAs that direct the production of viral proteins in infected cells. </p><p>"It hangs on the tail end of the messenger RNA like a little molecular knob," Noller said. </p><p>Noller, an expert on the ribosome, noticed that a sharp, 90-degree bend in the s2m RNA structure is similar to a part of the ribosome. "It may only be a superficial resemblance, but you don't often see this kind of right-angle bend in RNA," Noller said. </p><p>This part of the ribosome and the proteins that bind to it are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, leading Scott and his coauthors to hypothesize that the s2m RNA, by mimicking the ribosomal binding site, may serve to hijack the host cell's protein-synthesis machinery for use by the virus. This hypothesis will have to be tested by further studies, which are already under way in Ares's lab.</p><p>"The precise function is something they're going to figure out, no doubt about it, and it's bound to be something of major importance," Noller said. "When you see a whole class of viruses that have this absolutely conserved structural element, it tells you there's something really interesting going on here."</p><p>Sequence analysis by Haussler and Baertsch found that viruses in two families--coronaviruses (which include the SARS virus) and astroviruses--share the s2m element. About 75 percent of this sequence is absolutely invariant between viral species. Furthermore, an analysis of 38 different SARS variants found absolutely no variation within the s2m sequence. </p><p>Other scientists had previously noticed this highly conserved element in astroviruses and a few other viruses, and had given it the s2m name. But no one had any idea what the s2m RNA does that would explain why it is so highly conserved, Haussler said. </p><p>According to Scott, the UCSC team's investigation represents a novel approach in the field known as structural genomics. A more common approach in structural genomics is to determine the three-dimensional shape of a novel protein and compare it to the shapes of proteins with known functions to find clues to the function of the unknown protein. </p><p>"We have taken the methodology of conventional structural genomics and extended it to investigate the structure of the RNA genome itself," Scott said.</p><p>Ultimately, this research could lead to the development of antiviral drugs that would bind to the s2m RNA and prevent it from carrying out its function. Such drugs might be effective against a range of coronaviruses and astroviruses. While the SARS virus is the most deadly of these, other coronaviruses are common causes of respiratory infections in humans and other animals. Although none of the other human coronaviruses have the s2m RNA, several important animal pathogens do and would be susceptible to a drug that targets s2m.</p><p>Astroviruses, meanwhile, are a leading cause of gastrointestinal infections, second only to rotaviruses as a cause of childhood diarrhea. In developing countries, diarrhea is a major cause of death in children. A drug that blocks s2m could help alleviate this suffering, as well as provide another tool in the fight against SARS. </p><p>_____</p><p>Notes to reporters: Scott is currently on sabbatical at Cambridge University in England; you may contact him by e-mail at wgscott@chemistry.ucsc.edu.
