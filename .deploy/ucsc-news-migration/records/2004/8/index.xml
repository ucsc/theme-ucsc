Before that, Native Americans known as Costanoans settled the area.</p><p>Capturing and preserving this colorful history is the goal of a $100,000 campus heritage grant for 2004 awarded by the Getty to UC Santa Cruz. The grant will allow the campus to inventory its historic resources and nominate the area around the campus entry to the State and National Registers of Historic Places. Known as the Cowell Ranch historic district, the section includes the old ranch house, cook house, granary, and what remains of the cooperage and limekilns. </p><p>"We're enormously grateful to the Getty for giving us the opportunity to understand and document the rich cultural history of the lands that UC Santa Cruz has occupied for over 40 years, and we're especially honored to be among the distinguished campuses that the trust has assisted during the three years of its Campus Heritage Initiative," said campus architect Frank Zwart.  Both the university and our surrounding Santa Cruz community will be much richer thanks to the Getty's generous investment."</p><p> The grant is one of 25 Campus Heritage awards nationwide, and caps a longtime campus effort to gain historical recognition. Getty's Campus Heritage Initiative, begun in 2002, have awarded more than $7 million to more than 50 colleges and universities in a nationwide effort to preserve historic buildings, sites, and landscapes. The Getty is one of the largest philanthropic supporters of visual arts in the country and a leader in conservation and research in its field.</p><p>"We're very excited," said John Barnes, director of campus planning at UC Santa Cruz. "The Getty's support is going to help us a lot in terms of understanding what resources we have on campus, and in gaining more visibility for some of the structures we have at the entrance to campus. We actually are sitting on a very culturally significant site here." </p><p>Barnes will direct the historical recognition effort, but faculty members and students-as interns and through independent-study classes-are also expected to play a major role in the research. Barnes plans to work with art history/visual culture professor Virginia Jansen, who teaches courses on the history of UC Santa Cruz campus planning and the history of American campus planning, as well as assistant professor Sheila Crane of History of Art and Visual Culture, who specializes in modern architectural history.</p><p> "The University of California at Santa Cruz is renowned for its beautiful campus," says Deborah Marrow, director of the Getty Grant Program. "The Getty is delighted to support the university's outstanding effort to study and preserve its important historic sites as it plans for the future development of the campus."</p><p>The grant will fund:</p><p>. Completion of an evaluation of cultural resources in and around the district</p><p>. Writing of a plan to manage the cultural resources in the district</p><p>. Nomination of the district to the state and federal historic registers</p><p>. Compilation of a campuswide inventory of cultural resources, including Native American sites.</p><p>The California State Office of Historic Preservation will serve as the reviewing agency for the Cowell Ranch Historic District Evaluation, the Cowell Ranch Historic District National Register Nomination, and the UCSC Cultural Resources Inventory report. Barnes estimated the work would take nine months to a year to complete.</p><p>	"I'm hoping it will add another layer to the story of the campus as a whole, which I think has not been fully understood to date," said Barnes. "It's part of what makes the Santa Cruz region unique."</p><p>It was in the mid-1800s that lime production was a thriving industry in Santa Cruz County, and limestone-processing kilns-clearing the nearby forest for fuel-were constructed on what is now the campus. By the late 1800s, the Davis and Cowell Lime Company encompassed 12,000 acres and was the largest operation of its kind on the West Coast, making Henry Cowell the richest man in the county.  </p><p>Cowell died in 1903, and a few years later the kiln was closed as demand for lime-used in building materials-decreased. The property was leased for grazing, and a "gentleman's ranch" on the property continued into the 1950s. </p><p>Negotiations began in 1961 with the S. H. Cowell Foundation to purchase more than 2,000 acres of the property for a new University of California campus; classes began in 1965.</p><p>Today, several buildings from the ranch's limekiln heyday have found new life in academia. The old ranch house-its formal entry gate on High Street restored in 2002-is now the Women's Center. The Granary is a childcare center, the Cook House is home to the Admissions Office, and thr University Relations Division has replaced the horses in the Carriage House.</p><p>While some of these sites are in good repair, others are deteriorating. "Unfortunately, the more difficult buildings to adaptively reuse, including the Cooperage, limekilns, Stone House, and Hay Barn, have become victims of time and neglect," Barnes wrote in the grant proposal. "Listing of the district and completion of the management plan would allow the campus to raise additional funds to preserve these important historic structures within the framework of an overall plan."</p><p>Researching the area's history will also be helpful as work proceeds on the 2005-2020 Long Range Development Plan for the campus, Barnes said, noting that the campus is required by state law to consider the impact on cultural resources before building. "There are important remnants of historical and prehistorical activity in many areas of the campus."</p><p>The J. Paul Getty Trust is an international cultural and philanthropic institution devoted to the visual arts that features the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Getty Research Institute, the Getty Conservation Institute, and the Getty Grant Program. The J. Paul Getty Trust and Getty programs are based at the Getty Center in Los Angeles.</p><p>The Getty Grant Program is part of the J. Paul Getty Trust, an international cultural and philanthropic institution devoted to the visual arts located at the Getty Center in Los Angeles. The Getty Grant Program provides crucial support to institutions and individuals throughout the world in fields that are aligned most closely with the Getty's strategic priorities. It therefore funds a diverse range of projects that promote learning and scholarship about the history of the visual arts and the conservation of cultural heritage, and it consistently searches for collaborative efforts that set high standards and make significant contributions.

Melanie DuPuis, an associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and editor of the new book <I>Smoke and Mirrors: The Politics and Culture of Air Pollution</I> (New York: New York University Press, 2004).</p><p>	"Today we have smog alerts when the public is advised to stay indoors, and incidents of pesticide drift when residents are evacuated from their neighborhoods," said DuPuis. "Like the residents of early industrial cities, we deal with air-quality problems as part of our everyday lives." </p><p>	A collection of essays by leading environmental scientists, historians, and social scientists, <I>Smoke and Mirrors</I> tells the story of air pollution from 19th-century Manchester to Los Angeles and Mexico City today. The historical chapters foreshadow today's cross-national debates about acid rain, global warming, and ozone depletion, said DuPuis.</p><p>	As a term, "air pollution" has defied simple characterizations: Is it accidental or everyday, normal or abnormal, a sign of social progress or urban decay, inevitable or controllable? These unresolved questions signal that air quality demands an approach that goes beyond scientific and economic measurement, incorporating history, sociology, and political science, with a strong focus on issues of social justice.</p><p>	"Air pollution is like a mirror of society--it reflects our culture, our politics, our priorities," said DuPuis. "A clean environment, whether you're dealing with air, water, or other resources, is always the product of political compromise."</p><p>Looking at air pollution historically, readers see who won, who lost, and what has worked, said DuPuis, citing the early "win-win" solution when industrialists decided to introduce more efficient coal-fired boilers into their factories. The results--less pollution and lower operating costs--were good for business and the environment. </p><p>	</p><p>Today, the trade-offs tend to be more difficult, as the chapter by United Nations staff member Roger Rauffer on coal-burning family cookstoves in China illustrates. These cookstoves are a major source of air pollution in that country, according to Rauffer. "Most families burn the dirtiest, high-sulphur coal because it's the cheapest. They have no alternative," explained DuPuis. "If we superimpose the U.S. model of air pollution on China and ban cookstoves, we would cause substantial hardship." In their pursuit of cleaner air, the Chinese need to forge compromises that take into account the needs of their own people, she said.</p><p>	</p><p>A chapter by Jill Harrison, a doctoral candidate in environmental studies at UCSC, explores issues of social justice that have arisen between farmers who see pesticide drift as the occasional accident and farmworkers and residents who see themselves as regularly exposed to these hazards on the job and in their neighborhoods. </p><p>In her own chapter, DuPuis discusses the politics of market-based incentives to reduce air pollution. "Market-based solutions aren't apolitical. Like all environmental policies, they require that decisions be made, and they should be made democratically, whether on the local level or on the scale of the Kyoto protocol," said DuPuis. "That certainly isn't how they're being handled now, with the United States and private business dominating environmental decision making."</p><p>	</p><p>One of the biggest obstacles to progress is our collective dependence on the automobile, said DuPuis. Automobiles, along with industry and agriculture, are among the leading causes of air pollution. Although motorists as a group are quick to call for strict regulation of industry, they refuse to curb their own driving to reduce emissions. </p><p>"Programs that would require drivers to change their behavior have so far been politically untenable," said DuPuis. "That's why I'm such a big fan of the hybrid car. When I carpool my daughter to Sunday school across town, I'm emitting less than half the emissions of a regular car." Carpooling amplifies the environmental benefits but isn't always practical, noted DuPuis. "The way we consume resources has to change, but as the stories in this book tell us, technologies that are easier for people tend to come first," she said.</p><p>____________</p><p>Editor's Note: E.

The center brings together a diverse group of scientists from six partner institutions around Monterey Bay to study the processes that drive California's highly productive coastal ecosystems. </p><p>The new grant provides ongoing funding for CIMT's "Wind to Whales" research program, which is using new technological approaches to monitor and understand the complex web of physical and biological interactions in the Monterey Bay ecosystem. Wind-driven upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water along California's Central Coast stimulates massive blooms of phytoplankton that support a rich web of marine life, including productive fisheries, seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals. </p><p>A key part of the center's mission is to pull together a highly diverse array of data collected by a range of technologies and present the data in an integrated fashion, making it readily accessible to scientists, resource managers, and the public. These efforts are helping to establish the core technologies for a national integrated ocean observing system, a top priority for NOAA and other federal agencies. </p><p>"CIMT serves as a regional pilot project for what they would like to do nationwide," said Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and chair of CIMT's Board of Directors.  </p><p>In addition to UCSC, CIMT's partner institutions include the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and the National Marine Fisheries Service Laboratory in Santa Cruz. CIMT was established in 2002 with a $2 million grant from NOAA and received an additional $2 million grant last year.</p><p>Researchers involved in the center include physical, biological, and geochemical oceanographers; ecologists; resource managers; remote sensing experts; and instrumentation and networking engineers. </p><p>CIMT scientists conduct monthly surveys of Monterey Bay on the research vessel <I>John Martin</I> out of Moss Landing, gathering an abundance of data on oceanographic conditions and life in the bay, from phytoplankton to whales. For more continuous measurements of oceanographic conditions, instruments are deployed on moorings in the bay. MBARI, in association with CIMT, has developed an advanced mooring system that can monitor oceanographic processes in near real-time, and the center is expanding the number of these moorings in Monterey Bay.</p><p>In addition to the surveys and moorings, high-frequency radar from shore-based stations is used to monitor surface currents, while satellite observations are used to measure sea-surface temperatures and estimate phytoplankton abundance.</p><p>All these measurements are being used to investigate linkages between coastal upwelling, nutrient delivery, phytoplankton growth, and the distribution, abundance, and productivity of organisms such as squid, fish, seabirds, sea turtles, and whales. Ultimately, the researchers would like to be able to predict how the system will respond to short- and long-term changes in oceanographic conditions, such as El Niño events and climate change.</p><p>"This NOAA grant will increase our understanding of the influence the oceans have on our living marine resources and thereby gain new tools for the effective management and stewardship of them,"  said retired Navy Vice Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914deaf18072704601a012ffa47626ad"><name>536</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC physicist receives award to develop technology for neuroscience</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1092898800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC physicist receives award...</display-name><path>/2004/08/536</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/08/536</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338056897</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338056897</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Alan Litke, an adjunct professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received an award from the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience to support an interdisciplinary research project with neurobiologist E. J. Chichilnisky of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. The McKnight Technological Innovations in Neuroscience Award will provide $200,000 over two years to support their research.</p><p>Litke and Chichilnisky are developing technology to study how the neural network of the retina at the back of the eye processes and encodes information about the visual world and communicates it to the brain. Litke has been doing research in this area for more than a decade with support from the National Science Foundation and has been collaborating with Chichilnisky since 1997. He is also involved in experimental particle physics research at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, and is affiliated with the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC.</p><p>"This is truly interdisciplinary research, where our expertise in experimental high-energy physics can bring new possibilities to neuroscience," Litke said. </p><p>Litke and his collaborators (including other researchers at SCIPP and CERN) are adapting techniques and expertise from physics and microelectronic engineering to fabricate arrays of closely spaced microscopic electrodes and custom-designed integrated circuits. The system is based on the silicon microstrip detector technology and expertise that SCIPP researchers have pioneered and developed to study short-lived particles in high-energy physics experiments. In this project, these tools will be applied to the study of living neural networks, with current efforts focusing on the retina, a thin tissue lining the back of the eye. </p><p>Litke likens the retina to a sophisticated pixel detector that converts an input visual image into a set of highly processed electrical signals that travel up the optic nerve to the brain. He and Chichilnisky are developing a "Retinal Readout System" that will allow the simultaneous recording of signals from hundreds of retinal output neurons (the ganglion cells) while a dynamic visual image is focused on the input neurons (the photoreceptors). This system will allow them to study the neural code at the interface between the retina and the brain.</p><p>The researchers also plan to explore the applications of their research to the design of a retinal prosthetic device for restoring visual function in people with retinas damaged by disease. This aspect of their project will involve interactions with Wentai Liu, a professor of electrical engineering at UCSC and campus director of the Center for Biomimetic MicroElectronic Systems (BMES). Liu heads the engineering tasks for a major retinal prosthesis project involving several institutions. The project has produced a prototype device that has been tested in a small number of patients with promising results. </p><p>In addition, Litke and Chichilnisky expect that their investigations of the retina will enable them to apply similar technology to the study of other neural systems. </p><p>Litke's collaborators on the project include a chip design group led by CERN researcher Wladek Dabrowski of Krakow, Poland. SCIPP researchers who have made important contributions to the project include research physicist Alex Grillo, physics graduate student Matthew Grivich, engineer Sergei Kachiguine, postgraduate researcher Dumitru Petrusca, and postdoctoral physicist Alexander Sher.</p><p>The McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience is an independent organization funded solely by the McKnight Foundation of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The McKnight Foundation has supported neuroscience research since 1977 and in 1986 set up the Endowment Fund, led by eminent scientists in the field, to oversee the program.

Tegner Memorial Research Grants in Marine Environmental History and Historical Marine Ecology. Seth Newsome, a Ph.D. candidate in Earth sciences, and Daniel Monson, a Ph.D. candidate in ecology and evolutionary biology, will use their $5,500 grant to investigate historical changes in the diets of killer whales during the past century. </p><p>The Tegner grants are awarded specifically to help scientists document the state of marine populations and ecosystems prior to large-scale human impacts such as industrial fishing, whaling, and pollution. The 11 grants made this year were chosen from among 86 proposals from scientists in 16 countries. The grants were announced last month by the Marine Conservation Biology Institute of Redmond, Washington.</p><p>Newsome and Monson are teaming up to investigate a controversial hypothesis regarding the ongoing collapse of marine mammal populations in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Over the past few decades, populations of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) and sea otters in this region have declined dramatically, but the ultimate cause of the declines remains unclear. The "killer whale predation hypothesis" holds that the depletion of whale populations by industrial whaling forced killer whales to change their diets, relying less on baleen whales as a food source and eating more pinnipeds and sea otters instead.</p><p>The hypothesis is supported by indirect and circumstantial evidence, but Newsome and Monson hope to find stronger evidence for a shift in killer whale diets by analyzing the isotope composition of killer whale teeth. Isotope analysis of an animal's tissues can yield clues to its past diet because of natural variability in the abundance of rare isotopes of elements such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. The teeth of killer whales are built up in layers deposited over an animal's lifetime, and the isotope composition of each growth layer should reflect the animal's diet at the time it was deposited. </p><p>Newsome and Monson have worked with colleagues at the National Marine Mammal Lab to obtain about 90 killer whale tooth specimens from museum collections. They have grouped the specimens to represent three relevant time periods: 1900 to 1950, 1950 to 1970, and 1970 to 2003. They plan to section teeth and analyze individual growth rings using a mass spectrometer in the Stable Isotope Laboratory at UCSC. </p><p>Newsome has also been investigating the role that changes in productivity may be playing in the decline of the Bering Sea ecosystem. In addition, he has been working with Paul Koch, professor of Earth sciences, and Diane Gifford-Gonzalez, professor of anthropology, to study historical changes in populations of northern fur seals along the California coast over the past 5,000 years, using isotope analysis of remains left at middens by native people. </p><p>Monson earned his M.S. in marine sciences at UCSC in 1995, studying sea otter populations with James Estes, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. He has been a research wildlife biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Alaska Science Center since 1996 and has returned to UCSC to pursue his Ph.D., with professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Terrie Williams as his adviser. He has extensive experience as a field biologist studying a variety of marine mammals in Alaska and California. </p><p>The Tegner grants honor the memory of Mia J. Tegner, a marine biologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography who lost her life in 2001 while carrying out research off southern California. She studied the ecology of kelp forest communities and abalone populations and was particularly interested in understanding how marine populations and ecosystems have changed as a result of human activities. This pioneering research earned her appointments as a Pew Fellow in Marine Conservation and as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The Mia J. Tegner Memorial Research Grants were started by the Marine Conservation Biology Institute with funding from the Oak Foundation, the Christensen Fund, and the Weinstein Family Foundation.</p><p>The Marine Conservation Biology Institute is a nonprofit science organization dedicated to advancing the science of marine conservation biology and promoting cooperation essential to protecting, restoring, and sustainably using the living sea.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dee188072704601a012ff895dc9e7"><name>538</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers discover first Neptune-sized planets outside our solar system</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1093935600000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers discover first Neptune-sized...</display-name><path>/2004/08/538</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/08/538</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338057703</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338057703</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A team of astronomers has announced the discovery of some of the smallest planets yet detected beyond our solar system. The two newly discovered planets represent a new class of extrasolar planets, and their discovery is a significant advance in the quest for such objects.</p>
<p>"These are important milestones on our way toward being able to detect planets the size of Earth," said Steven Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and codiscoverer of one of the new planets.</p>
<p>Each of the newly discovered planets is roughly comparable to the planet Neptune in our own solar system, said Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, a codiscoverer of both planets. Although the new planets are about 20 times the size of Earth, they are much smaller than the roughly 120 other extrasolar planets (also called exoplanets) that have been discovered to date. Most of those objects are considerably larger than the largest planets in our solar system, Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>Vogt and Marcy (who was Vogt's first graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, earning his Ph.D. in 1982) are members of the California and Carnegie Planet Search Team, which has discovered the majority of the known extrasolar planets. These discoveries rely on a strategy pioneered more than a decade ago by Marcy and team member Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The researchers monitor a long list of candidate stars looking for a telltale "wobble" caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. The wobble shows up as subtle "Doppler shifts" in the starlight and can only be detected with sensitive spectrographs that separate the light gathered by telescopes into its component colors or frequencies.</p>
<p>The first of the new Neptune-mass planets was discovered by Butler, Vogt, Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University, and Marcy at the Keck I Telescope in Hawaii, using the HIRES spectrograph designed by Vogt. It is only the second exoplanet found around a type of cool, reddish, low-mass star known as an M dwarf. M dwarf stars are very faint, and only the largest telescopes, such as the Keck, have the light-gathering capacity needed to detect Doppler shifts in their dim light.</p>
<p>The astronomers have been using the Keck Telescope to monitor 950 nearby stars, of which 150 are M dwarfs. The star harboring the new Neptune-mass planet is called Gliese 436. It lies about 33 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Leo. The planet, with a mass at least 21 times that of Earth, orbits the star once every 2.64 days at a distance of about 4.5 million kilometers, only about 3 percent of Earth's distance from the Sun.</p>
<p>"This discovery is particularly exciting because we've been looking for planets around M dwarf stars for a long time. It's a common type of star, so there are a lot of them out there," Vogt said.</p>
<p>The second of the new Neptunes was found in orbit around 55 Cancri, a yellow, sun-like star that lies about 41 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Cancer.</p>
<p>In 2002, the same team had already announced their discovery of three planets around 55 Cancri, based largely on observations made by Fischer at UC's Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton. (Vogt also designed the spectrograph used by the planet hunters at Lick Observatory.) Over time, however, they found that their subsequent Doppler measurements were beginning to vary from the predicted values in a way that suggested a fourth planet.</p>
<p>The team then sent all their accumulated observations to University of Texas astronomer Barbara McArthur, who has been organizing a major campaign to study the 55 Cancri system. Combining that dataset with another 100 Doppler measurements taken with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas, McArthur and her colleagues then confirmed the star does indeed have a fourth planet. It has 18 Earth masses, an orbital period of 2.81 days, and an orbital radius of just 3.8 percent that of Earth.</p>
<p>The composition of the two new Neptune-mass planets is unknown. They could be gas giants, similar to Jupiter and Saturn, or more like Neptune itself, which has a core of rock and ice. It could even be a barren ball of rock and iron without an envelope of gas.</p>
<p>"With these smaller planets, we are now down to the level where they could almost be rocky planets," Vogt said.</p>
<p>A recent major detector upgrade to the HIRES spectrograph will lead to even more discoveries of such planets, he added.</p>
<p>"We just finished the first tests, which show much greater precision than we had before. The higher precision of the instrument will allow us to detect even lower-mass planets than these, carrying us down into the realm of terrestrial or rocky planets," Vogt said.</p>
<p>The researchers will publish their results in December as two separate peer-reviewed papers in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. The authors of the first paper, in addition to Butler, Vogt, Marcy, and Fischer, are Jason Wright of Berkeley, Gregory Henry of Tennessee State University, Greg Laughlin of UC Santa Cruz, and Jack Lissauer of NASA Ames Research Center. The authors of the second paper, in addition to McArthur, are Michael Endl, Fritz Benedict and William Cochran, University of Texas, Austin; Fischer, Marcy, and Butler; Dominique Naef, Michel Mayor, Didier Queloz, and Stephane Udry, Observatoire de Geneve, Switzerland; and Thomas Harrison, New Mexico State University.</p>
<p>The new discoveries were publicly announced at a NASA Science Update on August 31. European astronomers earlier this month announced preliminary evidence for the detection of one other Neptune-sized planet.</p>
