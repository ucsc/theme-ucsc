<p>The funding is an enormous boost for the <a href="http://www.alumni.ucsc.edu/pesss/index.htm">Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society</a>, an alumni-driven, volunteer-based program established in 1999 that provides financial, academic, and emotional support to students before and during their years at UCSC.</p>
<p>"In the five short years since it was established, the Smith Society has reached out to nearly 100 young people who are 'on their own,' helping them navigate the bureaucracy of the university and become successful students," said Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor for Student Affairs at UCSC. "This collaboration with the Stuart Foundation will allow us to build a model program that can be replicated at other universities and colleges." With the grant, the society will become an established university program operating under the Student Affairs Division's Services for Transer &amp; Re-Entry Students (STARS) office.</p>
<p>The Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society (PESSS) was established by Bill Dickinson, one of UCSC's first graduates and a veteran of the foster care system, to honor the founding provost of Cowell College and his wife. Dickinson's goal was to make higher education a realistic option for foster youth, most of whom grow up without anyone making their education a top priority. His mission resonated with fellow UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff, who banded together to nurture the educational aspirations of youth who live largely on their own, particularly foster youth.</p>
<p>"What drives me is the imaginative, loving, daring quality of community I had as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz," said Dickinson. "That's what taught me to discover my own greatness and dare to go after my dreams. The Smith Society is, I think, a remarkable embodiment of that original spirit."</p>
<p>Adult members of the society share a commitment to providing students, called Collegiate Fellows, with "access to excellence," said Dickinson, noting that, for example, a UCSC film major spent a recent academic quarter working on documentary filmmaker Michael Moore's newest production, Fahrenheit 911, thanks to the assistance of faculty member Paul Ortiz, and an astrophysics major is enjoying the mentorship of David Dorfan, a senior UCSC physicist who, said Dickinson, embodies the best of the UCSC spirit.</p>
<p>"More than financial support, we provide community, and we ask Collegiate Fellows to help us reach out to younger kids and pull them into the community," said Dickinson. "I have always loved Cowell College's motto--'the pursuit of truth in the company of friends.' That's what we're about."</p>
<p>The Stuart Foundation grant will support the expansion of the society's work through the hiring of a program coordinator and a part-time project assistant. With the grant, PESSS will serve approximately 40 current UCSC students, 40 community college or high school students who are in the process of applying to UCSC, and will expand its outreach efforts to an additional 200 to 300 precollege youth, largely in high school.</p>
<p>"What foster kids don't have is anyone who says, 'I'll believe in you. I'll encourage you to have a dream. I'll be sure you understand the college admission process. I'll hang in with you. I'll nag you. I'll remind you of deadlines,'" explained Dickinson. "'And after you get into college, I'll still be there for you.' Foster kids, for the most part, don't have anybody paying attention to their education, so that's what we're doing."</p>

<p>Awarded a MacArthur "genius" award for his work, Cortes will be the keynote speaker at the fifth annual UC Santa Cruz Center for Justice, Tolerance and Community spring lecture on Tuesday, April 13, at 7 p.m. in Holy Cross Hall in Santa Cruz. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>During his talk, entitled "Building Community Across Regions: Organizing, Networks &amp; Power in a Changing America," Cortes will discuss individual participation in American politics and the importance of agitation, confrontation, and compromise in the democratic process.</p>

<p>Cortes is the southwest regional director of the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), a network of community organizations that fights for social justice by waging campaigns for living wages, equitable public investments, effective public school reform, and other causes.</p>
<p>Rooted in faith-based and other community institutions, IAF organizations work together regionally and at the statewide level to revitalize local democracies. The goal is to help "ordinary people" develop the competence, confidence, and leadership to be, as Thomas Jefferson said, "participators in the affairs of government."</p>

<p>The Southwest IAF Network includes groups from California to Texas and Iowa and is estimated to have a combined leadership of more than 25,000 people and to represent more than 250,000 families.</p>

<p>A native of San Antonio, Texas, Cortes is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M University, where he majored in English and economics and graduated at the age of 19. Now based in Los Angeles, Cortes is invigorating the IAF organization in that area.</p>
<p>In addition to being named a MacArthur Fellow in 1984, Cortes received the H. J. Heinz Award for public policy in 1999. He was a fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government's Institute of Politics at Harvard University in 1993, and he was the Martin Luther King Jr. Visiting Professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999.</p>
<p>His visit to UCSC is being cosponsored by the Center for Justice, Tolerance and Community and numerous campus organizations and academic departments, including the Cowell College Chapman-Smith Lectureship and Communities Organized for Relational Power in Action.</p>

The group has been overseeing research in this area since May 2002, when it received an initial $1 million grant from the CEC. The new funding will expand the research program to address avian and bat fatalities associated with wind-generated power systems. </p><p>Thousands of hawks, eagles, owls, other birds, and bats die each year from interactions with utility structures, including wind turbines, electrical conductors, and distribution poles. </p><p>"Wind turbine mortality is a difficult problem to observe, quantify, or solve. We are looking for some really innovative solutions to this potentially significant cause of raptor death in California," said Brian Walton, coordinator of the SCPBRG, based at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>Wind power is generally considered to be environmentally friendly--it does not produce harmful emissions, it is compatible with many other land uses and is relatively inexpensive, and it reduces U.S. dependence on foreign fuel sources. Some wind farms, however, are responsible for a large number of bird fatalities, and recent surveys have shown higher numbers of bat fatalities at newer developments. </p><p>One recent study reported that at least 1,000 bird fatalities may occur every year at Altamont wind farm near Livermore, California. About 50 percent of these losses are raptors, which are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald Eagle and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the California Fish and Game Code. The rate of bat fatalities due to interactions with wind turbines is unknown, but some biologists have expressed concerns about the effects of wind farms on bat populations. </p><p>The issue has become more pressing for utility companies in recent years as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has adopted a tougher stance toward the industry over the deaths of protected birds. After years of looking the other way, the agency is now threatening to prosecute and fine companies for the deaths of protected birds. In 1999, a Colorado utility cooperative became the first power company to be prosecuted in federal court for bird electrocutions; the company was fined and forced to retrofit its wiring. </p><p>In California, the state Energy Commission has taken the lead in addressing these problems. </p><p>"UC Santa Cruz has been assisting our efforts to develop effective solutions, and we felt it was important to expand the program to address the problems associated with wind power," said Commissioner Art Rosenfeld, chair of the CEC's research and development committee. </p><p>The original program focused on finding effective ways of reducing bird deaths caused by electrocutions and collisions with traditional power structures. Under the contract amendment, the SCPBRG will expand the commission's program to include research aimed at reducing bird and bat mortality on wind farms. The program now includes research and development activities in four main areas:</p><p>* Risk assessment research to develop and implement methods and tools to locate and assess energy-related structures that present high risks for electrocutions and collisions, and to determine the extent of negative avian and bat interactions in California. </p><p>* Risk reduction research to develop and implement standards, guidelines, tools, and procedures to reduce the extent of negative avian and bat interactions with energy-related systems. </p><p>* Compliance monitoring to develop and implement procedures, guidelines, and standards for auditing the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. </p><p>* Technology transfer to develop media needed by agencies, researchers, and industry to access and share information intended to promote and improve bird-safe practices in regard to transmission system upgrade, maintenance, and design. </p><p>The SCPBRG was established in 1975 to restore the endangered peregrine falcon population in California. The group now applies its expertise to a wide range of bird species and is working toward creative solutions for a variety of wildlife management challenges in the western United States.

Bardos appeared in a double bill with Back to the Origin by renowned Korean composer Chan-Hae Lee, whose work was performed last spring at UCSC's Pacific Rim Festival. </p><p>Both operas were produced by the Seoul Contemporary Opera Company and staged on March 23-24, before an audience of approximately 1,000 people at Hoam Art Hall in downtown Seoul. Paiement, professor of music at UCSC, served as guest conductor and Staufenbiel, a UCSC music lecturer, functioned as guest stage director. Bay Area mezzo-soprano Lisa van der Ploeg played the central role in Bardos, and Olympia, Washington, choreographer Doranne Crable directed the production's Butoh dancers. </p><p>"It was an adventure, an amazing experience," said Jones, who has taught music theory and composition at UCSC since 1990. "We kept recalling the movie Lost in Translation--there were so many interesting misunderstandings. We came to the country knowing no Korean, and though we did learn a few words, most of our communication was in English and German. Our hosts were extremely gracious in facilitating the communication that made the production possible."</p><p>Although the performances were booked last November, advance rehearsal for Jones's opera was literally impossible because most of the performers resided in Korea. In addition to the solo mezzo-soprano, the cast included a 14-member women's choir, three percussionists, an organist, pianist, actress, and three dancers. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Paiement and Staufenbiel acted as conductor and stage director for the other production as well. As a result, the UCSC contingent embarked upon a non-stop rehearsal schedule from the moment of its arrival in Asia.</p><p>"We virtually did not get off the university campus where we were staying in Seoul for the first eight days," Jones recalled. "Along with the casts of both operas, we just stayed and worked. Nicole and Brian broke the production up into parts and put it back together again, while I advised and assisted in any way I could. It was an extremely narrow time frame in which to prepare two staged operas--both casts worked hard to pull it together."  </p><p>Jones said he was inspired to write his opera by a vivid dream he had after his mother died. The title Bardos refers to the stages that the soul passes through after death according to the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The opera was sung in English and Latin, with two monologues for an actress that were delivered in Korean, translated from the original English. This created a bit of a problem as Jones and Staufenbiel attempted to coach the actress in rehearsals.</p><p>"She didn't speak English," Jones recalled. "So the singer would translate our English instructions into German, which the Korean pianist would in turn translate into Korean for the actress. Of course, our comments were based on guesses about the pacing of the text and how it would read in Korean culture as compared to American culture," he added. "We just hoped our instructions-such as to slow down, or to emphasize certain emotional states--were understood and carried the meaning we intended for the Korean audience."</p><p>Jones noted that the final performances were quite well-received, but said the real highlight of the trip was the process of bringing together diverse cultural and professional styles in a collaborative effort. Staufenbiel, director of UCSC's opera program, agreed that despite the frenetic schedule, he would do it all over again.</p><p>	       </p><p>"Korea was an extraordinary experience, a mixture of ancient society and modern Western culture-palaces and shrines, neon lights, and cell phones," Staufenbiel said. "And the people were wonderful to work with-talented, dedicated, and kind."</p><p>				                                                                       #####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d88138072704601a012ffcae7a954"><name>473</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum will hold annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 17</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>UCSC Arboretum, Australian plants</keywords><start-date>1081321200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Arboretum will hold...</display-name><path>/2004/04/473</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/04/473</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338031584</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338031584</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum will hold its annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 17, from 10 a.m. to noon for members only and from 12 to 4 p.m. for the general public. The sale, held in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society, will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.</p><p>This annual plant sale is unlike any other, featuring both highly exotic plants and plants native to the local area. There are plants that have been imported from Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, as well as unusual forms of California native plants that have been collected by Arboretum staff. For its part, the California Native Plant Society sells only California natives, including some propagated from local plant populations in Santa Cruz County. Several kinds of native bulbs will be available this year.</p><p>Some of the best new Australian plants were imported and tested by the Arboretum in cooperation with Australian and U.S. growers under a program called Koala Blooms. <I>Verticordia plumosa</I> 'Pink Lace' is one of the Australian Koala Blooms plants that will be available at this year's sale. A dwarf, rounded, evergreen shrub with attractive bluish foliage, it has lavender-pink, delicately fringed flowers in tight clusters. </p><p>This year many of the batches of plants are small, so some species may sell out either in the members-only sale or early in the public sale, said Stephen McCabe, research and education coordinator for the Arboretum.

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, recently looked at the long-term effects of reduced Arctic sea ice on the global climate, and their most striking finding was a significant reduction in rain and snowfall in the American West. </p><p>The study highlights the vulnerability of western states, which depend on winter precipitation for their water supplies, to changes in the regional climate. The results also show the surprising ways in which a small change in one component of the global climate system can affect particular regions, said Lisa Sloan, professor of Earth sciences at UCSC. </p><p>"We were surprised at the result ourselves, but it shows how interconnected the climate system is. Here we are reducing Arctic sea ice, and the biggest climatic response is felt in an entirely different part of the world," she said.</p><p>Sloan and graduate student Jacob Sewall used powerful computers running a global climate model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research to simulate the effects of reduced Arctic sea ice. Their findings were published online by the journal <I>Geophysical Research Letters</I> on March 24 and will appear in a subsequent print issue of the journal.</p><p>Sewall and Sloan based their study on projections of recent trends in Arctic sea ice cover published by a NASA researcher in 2002. Taking the projected ice cover in the year 2050 as a starting point, the researchers ran the model to see how the global climate would behave. </p><p>What they found was a change in atmospheric circulation patterns that caused a small northward shift in the paths of winter storms over western North America. This shift in winter storm tracks resulted in significantly reduced winter precipitation from southern British Columbia to the Gulf of California. In some areas, average annual precipitation dropped by as much as 30 percent. The reductions were greatest along the West Coast, with lesser changes further inland. But even as far inland as the Rocky Mountains, winter precipitation fell by 17 percent. </p><p>The sea ice acts like a lid over the ocean surface during the winter, blocking the transfer of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere, Sewall explained. Where the sea ice is reduced, heat transfer from the ocean warms the atmosphere, resulting in a rising column of relatively warm air. The shift in storm tracks over North America was linked to the formation of these columns of warmer air over areas of reduced sea ice in the Greenland Sea and a few other locations, Sewall said. </p><p>"The projected reduction in sea ice cover during the winter is small compared to the reduction in sea ice during the summer, but it ends up having a big effect on North America," he said.</p><p>Sewall noted that the study only looked at the direct climate response to a reduction in Arctic sea ice and did not take into account additional climate effects that may result from increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are a major factor driving global warming, a trend that is expected to continue well into the future. </p><p>"In a scenario with increased greenhouse gases, we would expect to see other effects on the climate that would interact with the effects of reduced sea ice," Sewall said.</p><p>Higher temperatures due to global warming, for example, would increase the rate of evaporation and exacerbate the effects of decreased precipitation on the water supply. But there could also be effects on the climate system that might counteract the influence of reduced Arctic sea ice on winter precipitation in the West, Sewall said. </p><p>Arctic sea ice has been declining gradually over the past century, but the pace of the decline has picked up during the past two decades. The cause of the decline remains unclear, and it is not certain that the trend will continue. </p><p>Nevertheless, the new study serves as a warning that climate change can have small effects in one location that propagate through the system to become big effects somewhere else, Sloan said.</p><p>"As the climate changes, the effects will vary a lot from one region to another, and it may be hard to predict where the effects will be felt most. What we saw in this study is not something one would have predicted in advance," she said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Sloan at (831) 459-3693 or lcsloan@emerald.ucsc.edu, and Sewall at (831) 459-3504 or jsewall@emerald.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d8dca8072704601a012ff6b01dd5b"><name>477</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC student earns prestigious Goldwater Scholarship</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1081926000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC student earns prestigious...</display-name><path>/2004/04/477</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/04/477</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338033049</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338033049</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Tracey Kwong, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been named a 2004 Goldwater Scholar by the Barry M.

<p>WHAT IS THE Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)?</p>
<p>The 2005-2020 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) will plan for number of students enrolled, number of faculty and programs, transportation systems, land use, housing &amp; student life, community relations, infrastructure &amp; technology, and impacts to the social, built and natural environments. Once every fifteen years our campus redefines its vision, academic priorities, and physical development strategy through a Long Range Development Plan (LRDP). This is YOUR CHANCE TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF OUR CAMPUS. The LRDP will firmly impact everything (physical, academic &amp; social) about UCSC and our Community.</p>
<p>* The Strategic Futures Committee has recommended an initial working number of 21,000 students for 2020:</p>

"One way is to ban outsourcing, but that is costly and detrimental in the longrun because it keeps the economy from changing and maintaining competitiveness."</p><p> The deeper issue, which will be the focus of the workshop, is the long-term threat to U.S. competitiveness posed by growing centers of innovation in places like India and China, said Singh.</p><p>	"It's natural for 'back office' jobs to move overseas, just as factory jobs did before them, but the growth of research and development in emerging global centers like India and China has far greater implications for U.S. competitiveness than the movement of these jobs," said Singh. "What if U.S. companies, by pursuing shortrun cost advantages, are creating future competitors in knowledge and innovation?" </p><p>	For decades, the United States has relied on immigrants from Europe and Asia to bolster its leadership in innovation. "About half of all Ph.D.s earned in science in this country go to foreign-born students," said Singh. "These people who innovate are the engines of the U.S. economy, so the real question is whether the globalization of knowledge work poses a challenge to U.S. competitiveness."</p><p>"The United States has been the global leader in patenting, but what if it becomes China? What if it becomes India?" asks Singh. "We've seen earlier waves of innovation emerge in Europe and Japan, but it was different when there were only two or three global centers for innovation. What if there are a dozen?"</p><p>	Ultimately, global economic growth is good, but it requires adaptation, just as the U.S. automobile industry had to adapt to competition from Japanese manufacturers, said Singh, noting that policy makers need to weigh the implications of increasing support to research and development, education, and other areas. </p><p>"The Bush-Kerry debate is more about the shortrun adjustment costs of outsourcing, but we need to go to the deeper issues that are going to matter 10 years from now," said Singh. "If the U.S. maintains its edge in innovation and knowledge creation, we have nothing to worry about."</p><p>The workshop is being hosted by the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics, the Center for Global, International and Regional Studies, and the Baskin School of Engineering.	</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: To register to attend the workshop "Global Sourcing and Regions of Innovation," please send e-mail to sccie@ucsc.edu by April 21.

A prolific author, classical scholar, and UCSC alumnus who is often featured on National Public Radio and the PBS NewsHour, Hanson will speak on the topic: "Warfare and Democracy in the Ancient and Contemporary Middle East." This event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Hanson is the author of nearly 200 essays, editorials, and reviews for such publications as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, New York Post, National Review, American Heritage, Weekly Standard, Commentary, Daily Telegraph, and Washington Times. </p><p>He has written or edited 13 books, including Warfare and Agriculture in Classical Greece (1983), the Western Way of War (1989), and Mexifornia: A State of Becoming (2003). Hanson's recent books, particularly Autumn of War (Anchor 2002), have attracted the attention of Vice President Dick Cheney, who read Hanson's work after September 11 and had him to dinner. Hanson's latest book, Ripples of Battle, was published by Doubleday last year.</p><p>Currently a professor of classics at California State University, Fresno, Hanson is also a senior research fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. His work offers a distinct perspective on a variety of topics--ranging from the demise of the family farm, to the impact of Mexican immigration on California, to the role of the United States in global statesmanship and defense.</p><p>Hanson received his B.A. from UCSC in 1975 and earned his Ph.D. in classics from Stanford in 1980. He was a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford (1992-93), a visiting professor of classics at Stanford (1991-92), a recipient of the Eric Breindel Award for Opinion Journalism (2002), and winner of the UCSC Alumni Association's Alumni Achievement Award in 2001. He also served as the visiting Shifrin Chair of Military History at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland (2002-03).</p><p>Hanson's lecture is presented by the UCSC Jewish Studies Research Colloquium and sponsored by the Koret Foundation in honor of its 25th anniversary. Murray Baumgarten, director of Jewish Studies at UCSC, noted that Hanson will bring to the campus "a historical perspective on the Middle East, the birthplace of Jewish culture more than 3,500 years ago."</p><p>"Hanson will also comment on the democratic governmental form that was invented in Athens, but is now--except in modern Israel--nowhere functioning in the Middle East region,"  Baumgarten added.    </p><p>For more information, contact Eleanor Hilberman or Cheryl Van De Veer at (831) 459-1225.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d93658072704601a012ff6c7ef7a4"><name>481</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sweet limes, apple trees, and salad bowls debut at UCSC Plant Sale May 1-2</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1082098800000</start-date><display-name>Sweet limes, apple trees,...</display-name><path>/2004/04/481</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/04/481</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338034486</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338034486</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Psst!

In her new book, <em>The Hunter's Breath,</em> Williams interweaves two amazing stories from those expeditions: One is the story of the seals and their remarkable adaptations to life on and beneath the Antarctic sea ice, while the other is a human story of adventure and discovery in one of the most punishing environments on Earth.</p>
<p>The scientific question that Williams and seven fellow scientists set out to answer was a simple one: How do Weddell seals survive in the Antarctic? A professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Williams was particularly interested in how the seals hunt for food beneath the ice. Finding the answers was a thrilling adventure for the scientists, and Williams wanted to share the experience with others.</p>

"It was such an exciting project and the discoveries were coming so quickly, it just seemed like one of those grand adventures that people would appreciate," Williams said.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The project's popular appeal was brought home to Williams when she launched a web site for the 2001 expedition, posting weekly reports from the field. Initially aimed at primary- and secondary-school students, the site quickly attracted adult fans as well, and before long Williams was receiving enthusiastic e-mails from people all around the world.</p>
<p>"I suddenly realized that a broad group of people were interested in Antarctica and seals and the process of scientific discovery," she said.</p>
<p>The book focuses on the 2001 expedition, when the events of September 11, just before the group's departure, added new complications and emotions to a journey that is difficult and stressful even in the best of circumstances.</p>
<p>Williams wrote much of the book during the Antarctic storms that periodically shut down the team's activities and confined them to their small, isolated outpost on the ice. The fact that she was the only woman in the group is not much of an issue in the book. Williams and her fellow scientists, with their distinctive talents and personalities, formed an effective and cohesive team. They all knew how much they depended on each other for their survival.</p>
<p>There is a striking contrast between the struggles of the scientists to live and work in extreme conditions and the calm demeanor of the seals as they loaf about on the ice or dive gracefully through freezing water to depths that would crush a human diver. Yet life is not easy in Antarctica, even for an animal so well adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
<p>The researchers used an array of high-tech equipment to gain access to the hidden life of the seals beneath the ice. A compact instrument package, including a small video camera mounted harmlessly on the backs of the seals, revealed scenes never before witnessed by humans and provided the first physiological measurements from actively hunting seals. Watching a seal disappear through an ice hole with $50,000 of equipment on its back was nerve-racking, but the results were riveting.</p>
<p>"When we put that first videotape in the VCR, it was the most amazing thing," Williams said. "Suddenly we were on the bottom of McMurdo Sound, 500 meters below the ice, hunting with this seal. It's like the rovers on Mars--the camera takes you to where people have never been."</p>
<p>The videos showed Weddell seals gorging themselves on small Antarctic silverfish, attacking giant Antarctic cod, and fighting with other seals over access to breathing holes in the ice. Weddell seals are among the extreme athletes of the animal world, descending from their breathing holes to search out, stalk, chase, catch, kill, and eat their prey before returning to the surface to breathe again.</p>
<p>Physiological measurements of diving seals enabled Williams to calculate how much energy the seals had to expend to catch their meals. She also gained insights into how the seals manage to budget their oxygen supplies during dives that typically range from 20 to 40 minutes and sometimes last more than an hour.</p>
<p>Learning what it takes for a top predator to survive in the ocean is critically important for conservation efforts, Williams said.</p>
<p>"The problem now is we really don't know what big predators need to survive--not just Weddell seals, but dolphins, killer whales, sea lions--it's appalling what we don't know about big predators, and we're going to lose them if we don't learn enough about their biology to say what should be done to save them," she said.</p>
<p>In her book, however, Williams put less emphasis on the conservation aspects of her work and more on the pure excitement of the science.</p>
<p>"I wrote it for adults who may have forgotten what it's like to discover something new, and for kids who might think being a scientist is not appealing because the schoolwork is hard--to let them know that it's a grand adventure," she said. "Once you get past the math and the textbooks, it's exciting and you can let your imagination run free as you explore the world and try to figure things out."</p>
<p>Williams said her inspiration for reaching beyond the usual academic audience for her work--first with the expedition web site and ultimately with this book--came from Stephanie Mills, founder of the Ida Benson Lynn Chair in Ocean Health at UCSC, which Williams held from 2000 to 2003. Support from the endowed chair allowed her to devote the time and energy needed to bring the book to fruition.</p>

He was 80. Beevers died at his home in Carmel, California, after a brief illness.</p><p>Born in Durham, England, in 1924, Beevers earned a B.Sc. in botany and a Ph.D. in plant physiology from Durham University. After a postdoctoral appointment at Oxford University, he joined the faculty of Purdue University in 1950. Beevers spent 19 years at Purdue, becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1958. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1969 as a professor of biology. </p><p>Beevers made major contributions to the understanding of plant metabolism and plant cell biology. He and his coworkers worked out important pathways of plant metabolism and showed the locations of key enzymes for the conversion of fats to carbohydrates in fatty seed tissues. His discovery of the glyoxysome, a small structure or organelle within some plant cells, led others to discover similar organelles called leaf peroxisomes, and stimulated further understanding of the role of peroxisomes in animals.</p><p>"Harry Beevers was one of the giants in the field of plant metabolism, one of only a handful of biochemists who could claim to have discovered a new cellular organelle," said Lincoln Taiz, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a friend of Beevers. </p><p>"He was also a charismatic leader in the field of plant biology whose opinions always carried great weight in any debate. To me, he was a mentor and role model, someone I admired tremendously," Taiz said.</p><p>Much of Beevers's research focused on the metabolism of the germinating castor bean, which efficiently converts the oil in its seed to sugar. No mammalian cell is capable of this conversion. In castor beans, enzymes in the glyoxysomes convert oil into sugar to provide energy for the growing seedling during germination, after which the organelles disappear. The glyoxysome turned out to be the first of a new class of similar plant organelles called microbodies.</p><p>Beevers also investigated other kinds of plant organelles, other aspects of plant metabolism, and the transport of materials within and between  plant cells. He wrote more than 200 research papers and one book, <i>Respiratory Metabolism in Plants</i> (Harper, 1961). </p><p>In addition to his research, Beevers was widely appreciated as a mentor to young biologists and a brilliant lecturer who could electrify an audience with his eloquence and wit. Many of his students and postdoctoral fellows went on to become leaders in the field. He enjoyed teaching, and his courses at UCSC received rave reviews from students. </p><p>UCSC honored Beevers as the Faculty Research Lecturer in 1976. In 1991, a special symposium of the American Society of Plant Biologists was held in his honor at UC Riverside. In 1999, Purdue University recognized Beevers in its "Book of Great Teachers," a permanent wall display in the Purdue Memorial Union.</p><p>A member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Beevers received numerous honors and awards, including honorary doctorates from Purdue, the University of Nagoya in Japan, and the University of Newcastle on Tyne in England. In 1995, Oxford University named a building in his honor, the Harry Beevers Laboratory in the Plant Sciences Department. </p><p>In the early 1960s, Beevers served as president of the American Society of Plant Physiologists. He won the organization's Stephen Hales Prize in 1970 and its Charles Reid Barnes Life Membership Award in 1999. </p><p>Beevers is survived by his wife of 54 years, Jean Beevers of Carmel; son Michael Beevers of Fresno; sisters Win Allinson of Ripon, England, Edna Emerson of Weardale, England, Elsie Chapman of Portsmouth, England, and Vera West of Canterbury, England; brothers Alec Beevers of Stourbridge, England, and Leonard Beevers of Norman, Oklahoma; one granddaughter, Angela; eight nieces and six nephews. </p><p>No services have been scheduled as yet. Contributions in memory of Harry Beevers may be made to the UCSC Arboretum, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d999c8072704601a012ff7f9670ce"><name>485</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz fall 2004 freshman admissions: Campus becomes more competitive as 'admit' rate declines dramatically</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495); jrburns@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1082444400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz fall...</display-name><path>/2004/04/485</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/04/485</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338036058</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338036058</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California today (April 20, 2004) released <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/factsheets/fall2004adm.html">information about freshman admissions for fall 2004</a>. The data indicates that UC Santa Cruz received a record number (23,122) of freshman applications for 2004. UCSC's 7.4 percent one-year increase in applications contrasts with a 4.1 percent decline in freshman applications to all UC campuses.</p>

"Our reputation has caught up with our quality--UC Santa Cruz offers a great undergraduate education," said Martin M. Chemers, acting UCSC chancellor. "Thanks to the hard work of faculty and staff, prospective students and their families are increasingly aware of UCSC's academic achievements. This heightened appreciation for the positive impact of our research, combined with our reputation for commitment to quality undergraduate education, makes UC Santa Cruz a highly desirable destination for California's best students."<br/>
<br/>
<p>UCSC's freshman enrollment target for fall 2004 is 3,030 students--a number that is in keeping with a 10 percent UC-wide reduction in freshman enrollment mandated by the governor due to California's budget situation.</p>

<p>Here is UCSC-specific information about the fall 2004 admissions process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of freshman applications received by UCSC for fall 2004:<br/>
<br/>
<p>23,122 (a 7.4 percent increase from fall 2003; UC-wide freshman applications declined 4.1 percent)</p>

</li>
<li>Percentage of freshman applicants to UCSC for fall 2004 who were offered admission:<br/>
<br/>
<p>67.2 percent (UCSC experienced the largest one-year reduction in the UC system; this past fall's UCSC freshman "admit" rate was 81.1 percent)</p>

</li>
<li>Percentage of freshman applicants to all UC campuses for fall 2004 who were offered admission:<br/>
<br/>
<p>73.2 percent (fall 2003 UC-wide admit rate was 75.7 percent)</p>

</li>
<li>Number of freshman applicants denied admission to UCSC for fall 2004:<br/>
<br/>
<p>7,452 (nearly double the number from fall 2003; UCSC estimates that half of the 7,452 students denied freshman admission to the campus for fall 2004 are UC-eligible)</p>

</li>
<li>Average GPA of students offered freshman admission to UCSC for fall 2004, as of April 20:<br/>
<br/>
<p>3.81</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>"The increased interest in UC Santa Cruz, coming at a time when applications UC-wide are down, has created a highly selective admissions process for our campus," said Kevin Browne, UCSC's executive director of admissions and university registrar.</p>

Funded by a $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Developing Effective Engineering Pathways (DEEP) program gives community college students the guidance and preparation they need to transfer into engineering programs at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, and supports transfer students at UCSC with services and programs to ensure that they successfully complete a four-year degree. </p><p>Steve Kang, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, said the DEEP program is an exciting example of how community colleges and universities can work together to improve educational opportunities in science and engineering. </p><p>"We are working with two major community colleges to motivate and guide students who are interested in engineering so that they can make a seamless transition into our engineering programs," Kang said. </p><p>The DEEP program aims to get more students interested in engineering careers and help them succeed in the necessary course work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (called "STEM" courses in education policy circles). The program is particularly focused on meeting the needs of students from groups that have been underrepresented in science and engineering careers, said Carrol Moran, director of UCSC's Educational Partnership Center, which oversees the DEEP program.</p><p>"NSF has a strong interest in getting more underrepresented minorities and women into engineering programs," Moran said. </p><p>The partners in the DEEP program, which also include the NASA Ames Research Center, are already engaged with one another through the Collaborative for Higher Education. The collaborative was formed in 2000 by UCSC, Foothill-De Anza Community College District, and San Jose State University to coordinate the delivery of education and training in the STEM areas at the partner institutions. </p><p>"This grant will enable Foothill and De Anza to expand our work in providing educational opportunity for all, particularly students who are underrepresented in math and science," said Martha J. Kanter, chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District. </p><p>"There are many students with the talent and the drive to succeed in engineering careers who need the support this grant will provide. In addition, this is an exciting opportunity for Foothill-De Anza to further solidify our work as a collaborative with UCSC and San Jose State, with students as the beneficiaries," Kanter said.</p><p>Nancy Bussani, executive director of the Collaborative for Higher Education, emphasized that the new program builds on an established partnership.</p><p>"The three systems are already working together to improve the pipeline for higher education in math and science," Bussani said. </p><p>The DEEP program includes collaborative course work, tutorial services, academic counseling, summer programs, and research opportunities. A "Cyber Mentors" program will offer online advising, mentoring, and tutoring provided by undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and engineers working in industry. The five-year grant also provides opportunities for student internships in industry. At UCSC, program participants will become part of a residential learning community of undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty, all working together to ensure that engineering transfer students successfully make the transition into the university.</p><p>This multifaceted approach is tailored to meet the specific needs of students at different stages along the educational pathway toward earning a four-year engineering degree. The program also ties in with an existing state-funded program for high school students run by the Collaborative for Higher Education, said Edward Landesman, education director for the collaborative and a UCSC professor emeritus of mathematics. </p><p>"This new grant is a wonderful opportunity to extend the educational pipeline from the high schools to the community colleges and over to UCSC, and it's a terrific collaboration between these institutions," Landesman said. </p><p>"We will work with students on their math and science skills, show them how the concepts they're learning are applied in industry and at NASA Ames, and connect them with students in engineering programs at UCSC," he said. "The idea is to motivate them, make sure they have the appropriate preparation, and after they get to UCSC we'll continue to provide help with the academics, keep them motivated, and make sure they succeed."</p><p>The engineering programs at UCSC focus on the core areas of information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. By training students in these areas, the DEEP program will help meet the future workforce needs of the region and the nation, Kang said. </p><p>The program's goals are in line with the recommendations of a report released last year by the NSF's governing board, the National Science Board. The report, entitled The Science and Engineering Workforce - Realizing America's Potential, called for increased participation of American minorities and women in science and engineering education and research. The report emphasized the need to maintain an ample and well-educated workforce and reduce reliance on trained workers from other countries, noting that science and technology are engines of U.S. economic growth and national security. </p><p>The NSF report is only the latest to document the long-term need for the United States to produce more scientists and engineers. </p><p>"New fields and innovations are always emerging--like nanotechnology, where UCSC has real strengths--and there will be a void to fill for a new generation of scientists and engineers," Landesman said.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d9ed88072704601a012ff35377e81"><name>488</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>National Public Radio's European correspondent Sylvia Poggioli to give free public lecture in Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1082962800000</start-date><display-name>National Public Radio's European...</display-name><path>/2004/04/488</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/04/488</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338037406</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338037406</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As senior European correspondent for National Public Radio's Foreign Desk, Sylvia Poggioli has covered news from hot spots around the globe for more than two decades. Whether reporting from Rome, the Balkans, or the Middle East, Poggioli provides expert analysis on NPR's award-winning programs Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition.</p><p>On Wednesday, May 12, Poggioli will present a free public lecture titled "TransAtlantic Tensions: The Growing Divide" at 7:30 p.m. at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz (1205 Soquel Avenue). </p><p>She will appear as part of the University of California Regents' Lecturers Program, which brings distinguished professionals from non-academic fields to the campus in an effort to broaden the educational experience of students. Poggioli will participate in seminars, colloquia and informal consultations with students and faculty during a weeklong residency at UCSC.</p><p>Since she began working for NPR in 1982 as a freelance reporter from Rome, Poggioli has reported on events ranging from the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the civil war in Yugoslavia, to the Gulf War in the Middle East. She has received numerous awards for her work, including the George Foster Peabody Award for reporting on the conflict in Bosnia (1993), and the Dupont Columbia Award for NPR's coverage of the Gulf War (1992).</p><p>In 1994, Poggioli was elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for her "distinctive, cultivated and authoritative reports on 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia."  She also received the Emma Award that year from the Congressional Women's Caucus/Radcliffe College for reporting on rape victims in Bosnia, and the Silver Angel Excellence in Media Award the following year for her coverage of religious relations in Sarajevo.</p><p>The daughter of Italian antifascists who fled Italy in the Mussolini era, Poggioli grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in romance languages and literature. She began her journalism career in Rome with the English language service of the Ansa news agency, where she served as an editor from 1971 to 1986. Prior to that, Poggioli was active in women's film and theater groups and worked at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.</p><p>In 1990, Poggioli spent an academic year as a research fellow at Harvard University's Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government. In early 1991, she supplemented NPR's Gulf War coverage, reporting from London on European reactions to events surrounding the war. </p><p>Poggioli was part of the NPR team that won the 2000 Overseas Press Club award for coverage of NATO's 1999 air war against Yugoslavia. In 2000, she received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Brandeis University, and in 2002, the Welles Hangen Award for Superior Achievement in Journalism from Brown University. </p><p>Poggioli's lecture is sponsored by UCSC's Office of the Chancellor; the Committee on Regents' Professors and Lecturers; the Department of Literature; the Division of Humanities; the Institute for Advanced Feminist Research; the Institute for Humanities Research; the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community; the Center for Cultural Studies; the Department of History; and radio stations KZSC, KUSP, and KAZU. </p><p>For more information, contact Pam Lawson at: paml@ucsc.edu. </p><p></p><p></p><p>	</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914da0548072704601a012ff47e153fb"><name>489</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC student forum on LRDP planned for May 11; student representatives also plan meeting on Friday, April 30</title><author>Jim Burns (jrburns@ucsc.edu)</author><start-date>1083049200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC student forum on...</display-name><path>/2004/04/489</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/04/489</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338037779</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338037779</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A student forum on the effort under way to update the campus's Long Range Development Plan has been organized for Tuesday, May 11.

Robinson, professor of American studies at UC Santa Cruz, and one of nine professors slated to present scholarly papers at the two-day event. </p><p>"According to conventional wisdom, Mark Twain went into decline in the last decades of his life-he went bankrupt, his health suffered," Robinson explained. "We've tended to look at his major earlier works such as Huckleberry Finn in 1885, or A Connecticut Yankee in 1889, rather than anything afterward. This conference is designed to bring this period of his life more into the academic foreground." </p><p>Robinson noted that during the last two decades of his life, Twain wrote his best social commentary and was a high-profile member of the anti-imperialist movement in the United States.</p><p>"There's a lot of interest now in globalization, and one of the important periods of our history was during those conflicts with Spain in Cuba and the Philippines when we entered the imperialist business in a big way," Robinson observed. "Mark Twain was strongly opposed to imperialism. Early on, he saw it as a logical extension of race relations at home."</p><p>All of the papers presented at the conference will be published in a forthcoming issue of The Arizona Quarterly, a professional journal edited by Edgar A. Dryden, professor of literature at the University of Arizona, who will serve as moderator of the event. Other guest presenters will include Peter Messent, professor of American literature at the University of Nottingham, England; Shelley Fisher Fishkin, professor of English and director of American studies at Stanford; and Susan Gillman, professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>For more information, call (831) 427-0414.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914da5dc8072704601a012ff3806d21d"><name>492</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Haussler honored by computer science group as an innovator who changed the scientific world</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1083222000000</start-date><display-name>Haussler honored by computer...</display-name><path>/2004/04/492</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/04/492</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338039177</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338039177</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has named David Haussler, professor of computer science at UC Santa Cruz and director of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE), a corecipient of the 2003 Allen Newell Award. Haussler was recognized along with UCLA computer scientist Judea Pearl for separate groundbreaking contributions that have changed the scientific world beyond computer science and engineering. </p><p>Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, was cited as possibly the most influential contributor to the field of computational biology. Pearl, director of UCLA's Cognitive Systems Laboratory, made seminal contributions to the field of artificial intelligence. As the recipients of the 2003 Allen Newell Award, they demonstrate the remarkable influence that computer science and artificial intelligence can have on other sciences, on practical tools, and on human thought. The Allen Newell Award, which is cosponsored by ACM and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), comes with a cash prize of $10,000.</p><p>By focusing on scientific interactions between computer scientists and molecular biologists, Haussler has played a leading role in developing the new field of computational biology. His work laid the foundation for the modern probabilistic approach to detecting and analyzing the biological components of the human genome. His collaborations led to algorithms to assemble the first public working draft of the human genome and posting it on the World Wide Web. He also aided in developing interactive web-based browsers that analyzed and annotated genome sequences of human beings and other organisms. These web-based tools are used extensively in biomedical research.</p><p>Haussler is a fellow of both the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the American Association of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). He earned a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado and an M.S. in applied mathematics at California Polytechnic State University. A graduate of Connecticut College with a B.A. in mathematics, Haussler is a past chairman of the Steering Committee for the Computational Learning Theory Conferences (COLT) and associate editor of the Journal of Computational Biology.</p><p>Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA, realized the overwhelming prevalence of uncertain information in real-world systems and developed a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for artificial intelligence based on probability theory. He forged links between computer science and statistics, developing models that are used to describe everything from the effects of diseases to the likely behavior of terrorists. Pearl's ideas have revolutionized the understanding of causality in statistics, psychology, medicine, and the social sciences. His book Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is among the single most influential works in shaping the theory and practice of knowledge-based systems.</p><p>Pearl graduated from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, where he earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. He received an M.S. in physics from Rutgers University and B.S. in electrical engineering from the Technion, in Haifa, Israel. A member of the National Academy of Engineering, Pearl is a fellow of AAAI and of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). He is president of the Board of Directors of the Daniel Pearl Foundation (<a href="http://www.danielpearl.org">www.danielpearl.org</a>), and has asked that his share of the Allen Newell Award be donated to the foundation. </p><p>ACM will present the Allen Newell Award at the annual ACM Awards Banquet on June 5 at the Plaza Hotel in New York. The award was named for Allen Newell, a pioneer in artificial intelligence. It is presented to an individual selected for career contributions that have breadth within computer science, or that bridge computer science and other disciplines.

The survey will be sent to undergraduates at all eight undergraduate campuses. In total, up to 160,000 undergraduates in the UC system will be invited to complete the online survey.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">The UCUES survey is being administered by the new Social Science Survey Center at UC Santa Barbara. UCSC undergraduate students can access the survey by going to <a href="https://research.survey.ucsb.edu/ucsc/">https://research.survey.ucsb.edu/ucsc/</a> and following the log-on instructions.</font></b></td></tr></table>This unprecedented census approach to soliciting student feedback on the undergraduate experience will provide an invaluable source of information on the academic and civic engagement of students at UC. Campus officials and a team of academic and administrative researchers associated with UCUES urge students to complete the survey.</p><p>The survey includes a wide range of questions, including their use of technology, contact with faculty, the range of their civic engagement, satisfaction with their educational experience, and open questions on their observations.</p><p>UCUES is part of a larger project that seeks to improve the academic and civic experience of University of California undergraduates. This large collaborative project is led by Richard Flacks, professor of sociology at UC Santa Barbara; Gregg Thomson, director of student research at UC Berkeley; and John Douglass, a CSHE senior research fellow at UC Berkeley. Kyra Caspary, a graduate student at UC Berkeley, is also a member of the UCUES research team, and the directors of institutional research at each UC campus have shaped the content of UCUES and are a key part of the survey's administration. "It is truly a UC-wide and collaborative effort," notes John Douglass.</p><p>UCUES is aimed at developing a wealth of new data on how students make use of the opportunities and resources of the University.</p><p>More broadly, stated Douglass, "the University of California, with its eight and soon to be nine undergraduate campuses, is a significant laboratory for investigating the changing nature of undergraduate education in a major American research university. UC faces large-scale increases in enrollment in the midst of declining state funding support, dramatic demographic shifts in the socioeconomic and ethnic composition of its student population, and the prospect of significant changes in how courses are delivered." </p><p>UCUES is intended to be an annual or biannual survey, he notes, "creating a database invaluable for tracking these changes from year to year, for identifying strengths and weaknesses in UC's undergraduate education, and for more fully understanding the changing nature of how students are taught and how they view their experiences."  </p><p>"There are many undergraduate experiences at UC," explains Douglass, "dictated by such factors as a students' socioeconomic background, their choice of major, their objectives in attending a UC campus, and their opportunity to interact with faculty. This is the first time a major university has invited all students to share their experiences in a systematic way with the objective of translating research into actual improvements in their education."</p><p>There have been two previous UCUES surveys. The first survey was launched in the spring of 2002 and the second in the spring of 2003. However, these surveys were targeted at a sample group of students to represent all UC undergraduates. </p><p>At most campuses of the UC system, including UCSC, the spring 2004 UCUES is a "census" survey going out to all enrolled UC undergraduates. UC is the largest public research university in the nation and arguably the most prestigious. </p><p>Already, data and analyses from previous surveys have been used in UC Berkeley's recent accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and for assessing the quality of undergraduate education provided by academic departments. UCUES data is also generating new ideas on how to assess and potentially shape the university's new post-Proposition 209 admissions processes.</p><p>According to Richard Flacks, UCUES is innovative in several ways. "It is a major experiment in the use of on-line surveying to connect with entire student bodies and learn about how they view their lives as students. It provides the institution with important benchmark data for examining how students of diverse backgrounds are affected by their experience and by social changes. We hope to be able to track large numbers of those who respond to this survey in the future to examine the outcomes of their time in college. And we hope to create an exceptionally rich set of data resources for policy making and further research."</p><p>At a minimum, UCUES offers an innovative scan of the university's undergraduate student body with some surprising new information. "Respondents to our two previous surveys," explains Gregg Thomson, "have provided us with a more complete understanding of the remarkable demographic diversity of University of California undergraduates than previously available." </p><p>In a soon-to-be-published report summarizing the findings from the previous two surveys, the research team reports that some 55 percent of UCUES respondents have at least one parent who is foreign-born. "On the Berkeley, Irvine, Los Angeles, and Riverside campuses," states Thomson, "this figure exceeds 60 percent. UCUES also offers more complete parental income data than previously available and provides us with the estimate that 23 percent of UC undergraduates have parental incomes under $35,000."</p><p>UCUES is jointly funded by the University of California Office of the President and the by the Vice Chancellors for Student Affairs at each of the University's eight undergraduate campuses.</p><p>_____</p><p>Contacts:</p><p>.
