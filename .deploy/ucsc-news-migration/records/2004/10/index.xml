"We need to turn this around or Latinos won't be able to participate responsibly or compete equally in a democratic society," said Aguirre. </p><p>	The new Center for the Mathematics Education of Latinos/as (CEMELA) will address the mathematics needs of Latino students in kindergarten through eighth grade. The center will examine math learning and teaching in school, family, and community settings. The goal is to discover new ways to teach Latino students mathematics by building on the cultural and linguistic diversity they bring to the classroom. Research insights and new methods will ultimately benefit all students, noted Moschkovich.</p><p>	UCSC will receive $1.5 million over five years to support faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, and to work with new teachers through the UCSC New Teacher Center. The center will draw on the expertise of other UCSC education faculty, as well. By recruiting and training researchers with expertise in mathematics learning and teaching, language, and culture, CEMELA will develop the next generation of scholars who will, in turn, prepare the next generation of classroom teachers. The other CEMELA participants are the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of New Mexico.</p><p>	The new multidisciplinary center will support multiple research avenues. Moschkovich's own work focuses on how students learn mathematics in and out of school. Her research has documented the resources students use to communicate mathematical concepts, including two languages and their everyday experiences. "We have research that shows that kids learning English can participate in high-level mathematical discussions," she said.</p><p>	Aguirre, whose research focuses on teachers, school culture, and the teaching process, said her work explores how teachers' beliefs about mathematics, students, learning, and equity affect student achievement, and how schools as organizations affect what teachers do in the classroom. </p><p>"I look at the workplace culture to see how the norms and values of a department or school interact with individual teachers' values and how those factors influence the math teaching that goes on in the classroom," she explained.</p><p>CEMELA will build on this research and will support research collaborations among the four sites. The grant will also support teacher education by developing and disseminating innovative materials for use in courses and seminars at the four sites. Researchers will also work with the New Teacher Center to support professional development opportunities for new teachers in the Pajaro Valley Unified School District and North Monterey County Unified School District.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to Journalists: Judit Moschkovich may be reached at (831) 459-2004 or via e-mail at jmoschko@ucsc.edu; Julia Aguirre may be reached at (831) 459-5467 or jaguirre@ucsc.edu; CEMELA Director Cynthia Anhalt may be reached at canhalt@email.arizona.edu.</p><p>Contact: Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e16158072704601a012ffb1e63404"><name>567</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz hosts international economics conference October 15-16&#13;

But what do those words really mean? Apparently, different things, depending on your political affiliation.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">First book published by New Pacific Press in collaboration with UC Santa Cruz</font></b></td></tr></table>Shock and Awe: War on Words, explores the political meaning of words through essays, photographs, poems, and drawings by nearly 80 scholars, artists, and poets from UC Santa Cruz and around the world. Created by the campus's Institute for Advanced Feminist Research (IAFR), it is the first book to be published by New Pacific Press, a new venture recently begun by David Watson, owner of The Literary Guillotine bookstore in downtown Santa Cruz. </p><p>"The book is an effort to reclaim language that's been debased in the politics of the 'war on terror,'" explained IAFR director Helene Moglen, who holds a UC Presidential Chair in Literature at UC Santa Cruz. "The political rhetoric of the present moment makes many of us feel that we're strangers in our own language. And there are key words-words that feel to us particularly weighted-which when they are misused, make us feel disempowered as speakers and as writers."</p><p>For example, in her piece about the use of the term "security," New York University professor Mary Louise Pratt points out: "Talking about security is one of the most effective ways to cause fear. It's effective because you're not talking about fear, you're assuming it's there, or should be."  In a similar vein, author Kath Westin describes the word "on" as "a preposition designed to keep people in thrall to the things they love to think they hate. See War on Terror. See War on Poverty. See War on Drugs." </p><p>Co-editor and UCSC anthropology professor Anna Tsing gets to the heart of the matter in her essay on "Glory," when she quotes Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass:  "'When I use a word,'" Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less.'"</p><p>The idea for the book grew out of the activities of an IAFR working group titled Feminisms and Global War. Moglen noted that there was a tremendous response from people invited to contribute to the project.</p><p>"It struck a very resonant chord," said Moglen. "Words and values that are important to us can feel like they are being strangled or turned inside out. And the language becomes so debased we become tongue-tied. We all know that feeling of going to another country and feeling marginalized-having that feeling of strangeness verbally. So, it's very moving for people to have the opportunity to take language back, instead of feeling like outsiders who don't have a right to that language."</p><p>Watson said that the 200-page, soft-cover, small-format book is now being shipped to bookstores throughout the United States and Canada, and may also be ordered online at abebooks.com. Both he and Moglen noted that the volume is targeted to a general audience and is not an academic book. "We made a strong effort to make this book accessible to everyone," said Moglen. </p><p>Shock and Awe contains contributions by more than 20 UCSC professors and grad students and is co-edited by anthropology professor Anna Tsing, associate history of art professor Jennifer Gonzalez, and graduate students Bregje van Eekelen and Bettina Stotzer.

The event is scheduled from 6 to 9 p.m., in the Sierra Room of the University Inn, 611 Ocean Street, Santa Cruz.</p>

Intended to describe how the campus might plan for potential physical development through the year 2020, the draft considers how it would accommodate a potential campus fall, winter, and spring average campus enrollment of 21,000 students. That figure for potential enrollment by the end of the 15-year planning period was proposed late last spring by the Strategic Futures Committee, a faculty-led group recommending that number after several months of analysis of statewide demographic trends, desired development of existing academic programs, and potential creation of new academic majors or professional schools. <br/>
<br/>
<p>At the workshop, planning consultants from Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners of New York and campus planners will provide an overview of the first draft of the Long-Range Development Plan for 2005-20. They will also lead a public discussion of the draft, which was distributed on October 6 to the campus and community members serving on the LRDP Committee.</p>
<p>The draft document can be viewed online at UCSC's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/planning_2020/">Planning through 2020</a> web site.</p>
<p>"This draft represents our first attempt to address the campus's programmatic and enrollment goals that were outlined by the Strategic Futures Committee," said Tom Vani, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services and chair of the committee. "While the official definition of this project only considers the physical planning implications of enrollment growth on campus, the committee also is attentive to the concerns of our immediate neighbors and the wider community," he emphasized. "Including community leaders--along with faculty, students, and staff as members of the LRDP committee--underscores that commitment, and the upcoming workshop is another important opportunity for community members to continue providing their perspective as we move toward finalization of a plan," Vani said.</p>
<p>The LRDP draft includes the following highlights:</p>
<p>. States a set of principles that balance the university's academic, research, and service mission with a commitment to sustainable development and careful stewardship of a unique physical environment.</p>
<p>. Preserves open space to the maximum extent possible, including preservation of meadows south of the developed campus center as undisturbed grassland.</p>
<p>. Identifies a combined total of 53 percent of campus lands as protected landscape, natural reserve, habitat reserve, and site research and support for the UCSC Arboretum and the Farm &amp; Garden operated by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>-- 912 acres out of approximately 2,000 total acres for Campus Natural Reserve and protected landscape</p>
<p>-- 25.5 acres for habitat reserve</p>
<p>-- 152 acres for site research and support</p>
<p>. Identifies the Cowell Ranch Historic District site</p>
<p>. Assumes a housing land-use area to accommodate 50 percent of undergraduates, 25 percent of graduate students, 25 percent of faculty, and 3 percent of staff. (More than 80 percent of staff hired at UC Santa Cruz are already Santa Cruz County or nearby residents.) These figures are based on current consumer analyses, but enough land is being identified to house as many as 70 percent of undergraduates, should future demand require it.</p>
<p>. Espouses a goal to minimize use of single-occupant vehicles traveling to and within the campus, and projects only slightly more parking than provided in the 1989 LRDP, even with projection of a larger campus population.</p>
<p>It is expected that the draft Long-Range Development Plan will be completed in December 2004. At that time, the yearlong process of an environmental impact study will take place under the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). It is anticipated that the UC Regents will consider the final draft Long-Range Development Plan and its accompanying environmental impact report early in 2006.</p>
<p>Within the University of California system, each campus prepares a Long-Range Development Plan, which is similar to a city's General Plan, to support its academic goals; the plans also take into account projected statewide enrollment demand on the ten-campus higher-education system and other factors.</p>
<p>Upon their completion, the long-range plans define a building program and a land-use map that serve as a comprehensive planning framework for capital construction, infrastructure, and land-use programs. LRDPs are not mandates for growth, nor are they implementation plans, Vani emphasized, and adoption of an LRDP does not constitute a commitment to specific projects, construction schedules, or funding priorities.</p>
<p>The LRDP process that began last fall will produce UCSC's fifth Long-Range Development Plan, following plans that were adopted in 1963 (two years before the campus opened), 1971, 1978, and 1989.</p>
<p>A factor in the decision by UCSC officials to use the year 2020 as the planning horizon is the opportunity to align with the City of Santa Cruz's time frame in preparing a comparable planning document, its General Plan. The city's General Plan process will commence at the end of the year.</p>

The theory predicts how the movement of individuals between different populations of a species influences evolutionary change in those populations, particularly with respect to coevolutionary interactions between species. </p><p>This is an important issue in understanding the long-term effects of the increasing fragmentation of natural habitats due to human activities. Many ecologists believe that fragmentation of the natural landscape, by separating communities of organisms that had been connected, has the potential to alter the evolutionary processes that enable organisms to adapt to changing local conditions. This study provides hard evidence to support that view.</p><p>The study, published in the October 14 issue of the journal Nature, looked at the coevolution of a common type of bacteria, Escherichia coli, and a virus that infects it, called bacteriophage T7. The researchers were able to track adaptations that arose in both bacteria and virus populations and show that the pattern of adaptations depended on both the environment in which the organisms were growing and the spread of genes between different populations. </p><p>Ecologists use the term "gene flow" to describe the spread of genetic variants that accompanies the movements of individuals. This study provides the first direct empirical evidence that gene flow across a heterogeneous landscape can alter the dynamics of coevolution. </p><p>"By working with microbes that go through about ten generations per day in the laboratory, we were able to track evolutionary changes through time and answer questions that previously had only been addressed theoretically," said Samantha Forde, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and first author of the paper. </p><p>Forde's coauthors are John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, and microbial ecologist Brendan Bohannan of Stanford University. Forde conducted the study as a postdoctoral researcher in Bohannan's lab at Stanford. </p><p>According to Thompson, the history of evolution and the diversification of life on Earth is fundamentally a history of the evolution of species interactions, or coevolution. Thompson is a leading proponent of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution, which emphasizes that every species is a collection of genetically distinct populations that are linked across landscapes, resulting in complex geographic mosaics of species interactions that can evolve differently in different locations.</p><p>"We have a pretty solid theoretical framework for explaining coevolutionary interactions between species and how coevolution organizes biodiversity through networks of interactions across landscapes," Thompson said. "These experiments are one step in actually translating that theory into predictive analyses of natural populations."</p><p>The experiments used a simplified system in the laboratory to test the predictions of the theory. The basic coevolutionary dynamics of E. coli bacteria and bacteriophage T7 are well known. When T7 is introduced to a population of E. coli, the bacteria soon evolve resistance to the virus. The virus, in turn, evolves to attack the resistant bacteria, and then the bacteria are able to evolve a second level of resistance to the more potent form of the virus. </p><p>According to Bohannan, microbial experimental systems have become increasingly popular in ecology, due in part to the degree of control they offer and their relative simplicity. "Coevolutionary change happens rapidly in these communities and can be easily detected. Furthermore, the genes underlying these coevolutionary changes are known and accessible to study," Bohannan said.</p><p>Forde set up microbial communities of bacteria and viruses with different nutrient levels in a series of chemostats--glass culture tubes that provide nutrients and oxygen and siphon off wastes. In one set of chemostats the communities remained isolated from one another. In another set, Forde periodically made a series of transfers between communities, sucking up a pipette full of bacteria and viruses from one chemostat and adding it to the next one, and so on down the line. She also periodically analyzed the populations of bacteria and viruses in each community. </p><p>"I created in the laboratory a fragmented landscape with communities of microbes growing in different local environments, and then I looked at what happens over time when the fragments are isolated and when there is gene flow between fragments," Forde said. </p><p>In the isolated communities, resistant bacteria--and viruses able to overcome that resistance--evolved more rapidly in the chemostats with high nutrient levels than in those with low nutrients. That's because the microbes multiplied more rapidly in the high-nutrient environment, resulting in more opportunities for favorable mutations to arise. </p><p>The dynamics of coevolution were altered, however, by the dispersal of organisms between communities. In general, dispersal from high-nutrient to lower-nutrient communities sped up the rate of adaptation in the lower-nutrient communities by bringing in novel genetic mutations. Forde also found that gene flow increased the variation in coevolutionary dynamics through time.</p><p>"We had a pretty simple system, but the results were relatively complex. We found that adaptation can vary in both space and time across a heterogeneous landscape. It's mind-boggling to think about how these kinds of coevolutionary interactions could vary in nature when so many other factors are involved," Forde said. </p><p>Thompson has spent decades studying the mind-boggling variability of coevolutionary interactions in nature, with much of his work focusing on interactions between plants and the insects that pollinate flowers and feed on plant parts. Both the ecology and the genetics involved in these natural systems are highly complicated, however, and even long-term studies can only address a limited number of questions, he said.</p><p>"This laboratory system gives us a halfway ground between the mathematical models and natural populations. It allows us to test whether our assumptions are realistic, and that puts us in a better position to design experiments in natural populations," Thompson said. </p><p>Forde has also done extensive research on natural populations, studying invertebrate communities on rocky shorelines as a graduate student at UCSC. But she isn't done with the microbes in the chemostats yet. She has stored samples from the chemostat experiments in a freezer, awaiting genetic analysis. She plans to look at the genes involved in the coevolutionary interactions, identify specific mutations, and trace the genetic dynamics of the interactions through time.</p><p>"It's like having a fossil record of the viruses and bacteria. I can study their genes and see how dispersal influenced their evolutionary histories," Forde said.</p><p>In addition to providing general insight into the process of coevolution, understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of microorganisms is crucial to a number of fields, including human medicine, Bohannan said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Forde at (831) 239-9061 or forde@biology.ucsc.edu; Thompson at (831) 459-4741 or thompson@biology.ucsc.edu; and Bohannan at (650) 723-3344 or bohannan@stanford.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e21ab8072704601a012ff5819428b"><name>575</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC researchers join in new partnership to speed development of an 'artificial retina' to restore sight</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1097737200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC researchers join in...</display-name><path>/2004/10/575</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/10/575</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338070888</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338070888</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>CHICAGO, IL--In an effort to speed the design and development of an artificial retina that could potentially help millions of people blinded by retinal diseases, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham announced today that five Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories, a private company, and three universities--including UC Santa Cruz--have signed agreements to form a research partnership. </p><p>The goal of the agreements signed today is to advance the science, technology, and clinical success of the field of artificial sight using the facilities and resources of DOE's national laboratories. </p><p>Wentai Liu, professor of electrical engineering, leads UCSC's participation in this project. He traveled to Chicago this week to take part in the signing ceremony. Liu, who came to UCSC in 2003, has been working for more than a decade on the artificial retina in collaboration with researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) and other institutions. Liu is also campus director of the Center for Biomimetic MicroElectronic Systems (BMES), a national Engineering Research Center based at USC. The artificial retina is one of the test-bed projects for BMES. </p><p> </p><p>At today's announcement in Chicago, the first patient to receive a prototype implant in 2002 described what it was like being able to "see" large letters and to differentiate between a cup, a plate and a knife after being blind for over 50 years. To date, six volunteers have received implants of a microelectronic device that rests on the surface of the retina to perform the function of normal photoreceptive cells. The artificial retina technology was featured at DOE's "What's Next Expo," an event designed to showcase the newest, most innovative, cutting-edge scientific and technological advances to interest young people in pursuing careers in math and science.</p><p>"The Department of Energy has led the way to many scientific breakthroughs, especially when several scientific disciplines combined to make a whole greater than the sum of the parts," Secretary Abraham said. "This project is one such example where biology, physics, and engineering have joined forces to deliver a capability that will enable blind people to see. This agreement between the DOE laboratories and the private sector will facilitate transfer of many aspects of DOE technology to a clinical device that has the potential of restoring sight to millions of blind individuals."</p><p>The agreements allow Second Sight Medical Products Inc. based in Sylmar, Calif., to obtain a limited exclusive license for inventions developed during the artificial retina project. Under the research agreements, the institutions will jointly share intellectual property rights and royalties from their research. This will speed progress by freeing the researchers to share details of their work with their collaborators. </p><p>The artificial retina could help those blinded by age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa, diseases in which neural wiring from the eye to brain is intact, but the eyes lack photoreceptor activity. The artificial retina is a device that captures visual signals and sends them to the brain in the form of electrical impulses. The device is a miniature disc that contains an electrode array that can be implanted in the back of the eye to replace a damaged retina. Visual signals are captured by a small video camera in the eyeglasses of the blind person and processed through a microcomputer worn on a belt. The signals are transmitted to the electrode array in the eye. The array stimulates optical nerves, which then carry a signal to the brain. The first prototype implants contain 16 electrodes. The next prototype, with 50 to 100 electrodes, is in preclinical trials. The project's "next generation" device would have 1,000 electrodes, and researchers hope it would allow the user to see images.</p><p>The DOE-supported project is a collaboration of national laboratories, universities, and the private sector. Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Southern California Doheny Eye Institute are leading the multilaboratory effort. Liu's work at UC Santa Cruz includes wireless communication technology to provide the link between the camera and the implant. </p><p>Other partners in the collaboration are Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, North Carolina State University, and Second Sight.</p><p>The project's goal is to construct the device, capable of restoring vision, with materials that will last for the lifetime of a blind person. Although images will initially be captured by a camera housed in an eyeglass frame, researchers hope eventually to develop a completely implanted system for this purpose. </p><p>The Energy Department's Office of Science plans to fund the artificial retina project at $20 million over the next three years.

"These women are stellar examples of the kind of individual who not only is successful in her chosen profession, but for whom the personal is professional, and the professional is political. They are well deserving of accolades, and we are proud to honor them."</p><p> A leader of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement in 1964, Aptheker is a scholar of history with a national reputation for her talents as an instructor. She started out in 1980 as the sole lecturer in the UC Santa Cruz Women's Studies Department, became the department's first ladder-rank faculty member in 1987, and was honored with the Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001. </p><p>Past award recipient Janet Holmgren, president of Mills College, was the keynote speaker at the ceremony, hosted by an honorary committee of 39 people--including numerous members of the State Senate and State Assembly, and U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer.</p><p>2004 awards also went to Yvette Flores-Ortiz, professor of Chicana/o Studies at UC Davis; Debra Meyerson, associate professor of Education and organizational behavior at Stanford University; and Gyongy Laky, professor of environmental design at UC Davis.  </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e245b8072704601a012fffc4cbdd0"><name>577</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to host only West Coast tribute to late actor, writer, and comedic monologuist Spalding Gray on Oct. 23</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1097650800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC to host only...</display-name><path>/2004/10/577</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/10/577</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338071591</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338071591</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The late actor, writer, and comedic monologuist Spalding Gray was scheduled to appear at UC Santa Cruz last March as part of the university's 2003-04 Arts &amp; Lectures performing arts season. But the show was canceled after Gray was reported missing in January.</p>
<p>Gray's body was subsequently found in New York City's East River on March 7. He had apparently committed suicide by jumping from the Staten Island Ferry as a result of a consuming depression brought on by a disabling car accident he experienced two years earlier while celebrating his 60th birthday in Ireland. The head-on collision had fractured Gray's skull and hip, resulting in a metal plate implanted in his head, and a torn sciatic nerve that impaired his ability to walk.</p>

On Saturday, October 23, UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures and the Santa Cruz Film Festival will present a tribute to the man who wrote and starred in 20 original monologues (three of which were made into feature films), acted in 38 movies (including Beaches, The Killing Fields, Kate &amp; Leopold), and several Broadway productions (the Tony Award-winning revival of Our Town and the 2000 revival of Gore Vidal's The Best Man). <br/>
<br/>
<p>The evening will include a series of film clips put together by the Santa Cruz Film Festival, appearances by a number of his friends and theater colleagues from the San Francisco Bay Area, staged excerpts from Gray's monologues, as well as personal stories, photos, and audio clips provided by his wife, Kathie Russo.</p>
<p>"He was an American original," Russo noted in a telephone interview from her home in Sag Harbor, New York. "He was able to take mundane, daily observations and turn them into something extraordinary. There are so many one-person shows now, and performers who used Spalding as their model of how to do that kind of work."</p>
<p>One of Russo's many contributions to the event is a compilation CD that was compiled by Gray's friend for 30 years, New York City filmmaker Ken Kobland. Consisting of excerpts from different media interviews, as well as Gray speaking candidly about various subjects, the CD was previously played at an East Coast tribute held last May and attended by 500 people in Sag Harbor. A public memorial was also held in Gray's honor last April at Lincoln Center, where the participants included singer Judy Collins, performance artist Laurie Anderson, actress Lee Grant, solo performer Eric Bogosian, actor Eric Stoltz, and composer Philip Glass.</p>
<p>Gray became well acquainted with the Santa Cruz area in the summer of 1978 when he participated in a performance group workshop on the UCSC campus. That experience was immortalized in a monologue titled "Nobody Wanted to Sit Behind A Desk" that the Christian Science Monitor described as "'How I Spent My Summer Vacation'--elevated to the realm of art." During the next two decades, Gray would return to Santa Cruz often to perform his new monologues and hang out with friends.</p>
<p>"When we moved to Sag Harbor, he would always say, 'oh, it's so beautiful here, but we could be in Santa Cruz," Russo said. "He really loved it there. And if I came to Santa Cruz, I would spread some of his ashes there, and someday I will."</p>
<p>On the day Gray disappeared, there was a phone message from UC Santa Cruz theater arts professor Jim Bierman on his answering machine. Bierman had called to say hello and make plans to spend some time with Gray after his upcoming performance at the campus.</p>
<p>"I think the work Spalding did was outrageously pioneering," Bierman observed. "It's amazing to me because I'm frequently referring my students to the work he did in his earlier days." The professor went on to recall how he and Gray would often relax in the early 1990s by constructing trails along Laguna Canyon and the Coast Dairies property off the Pacific coast of central California.</p>
<p>"We used to cut trails that we used for hiking-many are still in use and one is now open to the public," said Bierman. "Spalding loved to wield a machete and we gave him plenty of room. He referred to it as a therapeutic process and he called it 'Dr. Machete.' It eventually became part of a monologue he was developing where he talked about therapy."</p>
<p>"Spalding's visits to Santa Cruz were always a great wonder because he simply had the talent for attracting the adventures he described in his work," Bierman added. "Eventually though, I became a little more careful what I told him, knowing it might show up later as dramatic material."</p>
<p>The October 23 Tribute to Spalding Gray will begin at 8 p.m. and take place at the Rio Theater, located at 1205 Soquel Avenue in Santa Cruz. Michelle Witt, director of UC Santa Cruz Arts &amp; Lectures, noted that a donation of $10 is suggested, and that all proceeds from the event will go to an educational fund for Gray's three children.</p>
<p>"Arts &amp; Lectures had a special relationship with Spalding Gray over the years; he has performed here many times," said Witt. "This will be a beautiful way to acknowledge him and what an important role he played in American theater."</p>

The new technology has a wide range of potential applications, including chemical and biological sensors with single-molecule sensitivity. </p><p>"It is an enabling technology that opens up a wide range of fields to the use of optics on integrated semiconductors to do experiments or build devices," said Holger Schmidt, an assistant  professor of electrical engineering at UC Santa Cruz.  </p><p>Schmidt and graduate student Dongliang Yin designed the liquid-core waveguides so they could be made using the standard silicon fabrication technology used on an industrial scale to make computer chips. The fabrication process yields a hollow-core waveguide that works whether the core is filled with liquid or gas. They described the novel waveguides and the results of optical testing of the devices in the October 18 issue of the journal Applied Physics Letters. </p><p>Guiding light waves through liquids and gases is a challenge because of their relatively low refractive indexes. In an optical fiber, light travels through a core with a high index of refraction surrounded by cladding with a lower index of refraction. The difference in refractive indexes results in "total internal reflection" of light waves, allowing transmission of optical signals over long distances. </p><p>To build a waveguide with a liquid or gas core, Schmidt relied on the principle of antiresonant reflecting optical waveguides (ARROW). ARROW waveguides with solid cores have been used for semiconductor lasers and other applications. The technique uses multiple layers of materials of precise thicknesses as cladding to reflect light back into the core. Schmidt's group has achieved low-loss propagation of light over useful distances in hollow-core ARROW waveguides containing air or liquids. </p><p>"Liquids and gases are the natural environment for molecules in biology and chemistry. If you can guide light through water and air, all of the fields that rely on nonsolid materials can take advantage of integrated optics technology," Schmidt said.</p><p>Schmidt is working toward chemical sensing of single molecules using liquid-core waveguides. He also sees potential applications for gas-core waveguides in the areas of atomic physics and quantum optics. </p><p>As cladding materials for the hollow-core waveguides, the researchers chose silicon nitride and silicon dioxide because of their compatibility with microfabrication techniques and the potential for integration with silicon-based electronics. The cladding layers are deposited over a sacrificial layer that is later etched away to create the hollow core, which has a rectangular shape. With a thickness of 3.5 microns and a width of 9 microns, it is the smallest hollow light guide ever made. The fabrication was done at a facility at Brigham Young University by John Barber and Aaron Hawkins of BYU, both coauthors on the paper. </p><p>"We can make many waveguides in parallel on a chip, so you can imagine probing 20 to 30 channels at one time, with each channel containing a different sample," Schmidt said. "And because it is all silicon technology, we can integrate it with electrical contacts and even put a silicon photodetector right on the chip."</p><p>Schmidt's team has also made two-dimensional arrays of waveguides that connect with each other at 90 degree angles, another useful feature made possible by silicon microfabrication techniques.</p><p>The researchers have been able to detect molecular fluorescence from a liquid sample in the core of the waveguide, using light from a helium-neon laser to stimulate a fluorescent dye. The experiment detected fluorescence from 800 molecules of dye in a sample volume of 200 picoliters (a picoliter is one trillionth of a liter). Further refinements should enable detection of single molecules, Schmidt said. </p><p>Fiberoptic connections can channel light into the waveguides, which could also be coupled with microfluidics systems--so-called "labs on a chip"--to control the flow of samples into and out of the waveguide cores. </p><p>Schmidt is also working with David Deamer, professor and chair of biomolecular engineering at UCSC, to combine liquid-core waveguides with a nanopore device developed in Deamer's lab. Deamer's nanopore device can feed linear molecules such as single-stranded DNA through a 2.5-nanometer channel one at a time.</p><p>"The idea is to use the nanopore to feed single molecules one by one into a very small volume in the core of the waveguide and capture the photons released by each molecule. There is really  nothing like this--it's a totally novel approach to single-molecule detection," said Deamer, who is also a coauthor on the new paper.</p><p>Schmidt's research on the liquid-core waveguides is supported by the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Schmidt at (831) 459-1482 or hschmidt@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e270e8072704601a012ff7986521a"><name>579</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gala Scholarships Benefit Dinner to honor former UCSC Chancellor M.R.C.

Greenwood, former UC Santa Cruz chancellor and now UC provost and senior vice president, academic affairs.</p><p>The campus raised a record <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=553">$32.2 million in private support</a> in the 2003-04 fiscal year and has ambitious plans to raise additional funds for student support.</p><p>A cocktail reception and silent auction will begin at 6 p.m. at the University Center, followed by dinner at the Colleges Nine and Ten Dining Room downstairs. The cost of the dinner is $150 per person, and RSVPs are due by October 22, at (831) 459-5075, or e-mailed to kpalma@ucsc.edu. Valet parking is available. </p><p>Although only in its second year, the Scholarships Benefit Dinner has become the premier fundraising event for UC Santa Cruz. More than $500,000 was raised for undergraduate and graduate student support at the 2003 dinner, which honored UC President Emeritus Richard C. Atkinson with the first UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal.</p><p>Cohosts of the event are Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers, UC Santa Cruz Foundation President Kenneth Feingold (Cowell College, '71), and UCSC Alumni Council President Kenneth Doctor (Merrill College,'71).</p><p>"It has been extremely gratifying to see our alumni and trustees reach out to offer a helping hand to students struggling with the financial challenges of higher education in a time of limited state funding," said University Relations Vice Chancellor Ronald P. Suduiko. "The fact that they are taking major leadership roles underscores their commitment." </p><p>Other volunteers serving on the planning committee are Foundation trustees Harriet Deck, Susan Hammer, Anne Levin, and Patricia Rebele (Porter College, '88).</p><p>More students than ever need financial assistance. In 2003-04, UC Santa Cruz provided financial support for nearly 8,000 of its undergraduates-up from 5,700 seven years ago.</p><p>The current estimated cost of a four-year undergraduate degree at UC Santa Cruz, including fees, books, insurance, and living expenses, is about  $85,000. Low-income families have been especially hard-hit by increased costs. In 2000, fees and tuition at public four-year institutions consumed 25 percent of family income for low-income families.</p><p>Honoring former Chancellor Greenwood-who once received scholarship help herself-is particularly meaningful, said Suduiko.</p><p>"No one knows better than M.R.C. Greenwood how scholarships can transform students' lives, allowing them to take full advantage of the opportunities UC Santa Cruz offers," he said. </p><p>As chancellor of UC Santa Cruz from 1996 to spring 2004, M.R.C.

Admission is free and open to the public.</p><p>"The concert is to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the Jews in North America--big exhibits are being planned across the country in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco," said Murray Baumgarten, professor of English and comparative literature and director of the campus's Jewish Studies Program. "We are also celebrating the fifth year of the Jewish studies minor at UCSC."</p><p>Baumgarten noted that over the past 350 years, Jews have spearheaded new musical genres, embracing Broadway theater, swing, big band, jazz, and classical music. "Many of the most famous composers of American songs were Jewish, such as Irving Berlin and the Gershwin brothers," said Baumgarten.</p><p>A number of avant-garde American artists were also Jewish immigrants to the United States who left Europe as a result of the Nazi regime. Kurt Weill was one of those immigrants and is best known for works such as The Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny, as well as American musicals such as Lady in the Dark and One Touch of Venus. </p><p>"During the last 350 years, Jews have made important contributions to American culture and society," Baumgarten noted. "This concert is a chance to celebrate how immigrants and refugees have contributed to Jewish life.and to American life."</p><p>A panel discussion will take place prior to the concert, beginning at 7 p.m. Titled "Kurt Weill and the American Songbook," it will feature Baumgarten and Francesco Spagnolo, a guest lecturer in music and Jewish studies at UCSC this winter and spring. Spagnolo holds a doctorate in music from the University of Milan and recently completed his Ph.D. in Jewish music at Hebrew University in Jersusalem.</p><p>For more information, contact: Professor Murray Baumgarten, director of the Jewish Studies Program, (831) 459-2566; Professor Nicole Paiement, UCSC Music Department, (831) 459-2164; or the Jewish Studies Program Office, (831) 459-1225.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e29b58072704601a012ff020f9d6f"><name>581</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UCSC professors elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1098946800000</start-date><display-name>Two UCSC professors elected...</display-name><path>/2004/10/581</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/10/581</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338072962</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338072962</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two professors at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are among the 2004 Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) announced by the association this week. They are Anthony Fink, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology. Election as a fellow is an honor bestowed upon members of AAAS by their peers.</p><p>The association is recognizing 308 members as fellows this year for their efforts to advance science or its applications that are deemed scientifically or socially distinguished. New fellows will be presented with an official certificate and a gold and blue rosette pin on Saturday, February 19, at the Fellows Forum during the 2005 AAAS Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Fink was elected as part of the Section on Chemistry for his distinguished contributions to the understanding of the molecular basis of enzyme mechanisms, protein-folding, molecular chaperones, and diseases involving protein aggregation and deposition. Fink's research has implications for understanding and treating diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. One of his major research projects, for example, is an investigation of the protein alpha-synuclein, which aggregates and forms deposits called Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease. He is studying the mechanism of aggregation and the role of various factors, both in the body and in the environment, that influence aggregation of this protein. He is also working to develop drugs that can be used to combat Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Fink earned his B.Sc. and Ph.D. in chemistry from Queen's University in Ontario, Canada. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1969.</p><p>As part of the Section on Atmospheric and Hydrospheric Sciences, Flegal was elected for his distinguished contributions to the fields of environmental biogeochemistry, environmental toxicology, and human health using stable lead isotopic composition analyses, and for interpreting and communicating that research to the public to address human health concerns with lead toxicity. Flegal studies how human activities affect the cycling of trace elements in the environment, investigating a broad range of topics involving metal contaminants such as lead, mercury, and chromium in aquatic and human environments. His work often has significant public health implications and relates directly to state and federal policy issues. </p><p>Flegal served as the founding chair of UCSC's Department of Environmental Toxicology, which was established in 2000. He received the 1999-2000 Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. Flegal earned his Ph.D. in oceanography from Oregon State University. He came to UCSC in 1985 as a research geochemist and joined the faculty as a professor of Earth sciences in 1992.</p><p>This year's AAAS Fellows will be announced in the journal Science on October 29. The tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874. </p><p>The AAAS, which publishes the journal Science, is the world's largest general scientific society. It was founded in 1848 and serves some 262 affiliated societies and academies of science. Science has the largest paid circulation of any peer-reviewed general science journal in the world, with an estimated total readership of one million. The nonprofit AAAS is open to all and fulfills its mission to "advance science and serve society" through initiatives in science policy, international programs, science education, and more. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Fink at (831) 459-2744 or fink@chemistry.ucsc.edu and Flegal at (831) 459-2093 or flegal@etox.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e2b0e8072704601a012ffbe3a062a"><name>582</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tech industry pioneer Lee S.

Bethe Prize to Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The Bethe Prize was established to recognize outstanding work in the areas of astrophysics, nuclear physics, and related fields. </p><p>Woosley, an expert in theoretical high-energy astrophysics, studies the most violent explosions in the universe--supernovae (the massive explosions of dying stars) and gamma ray bursts (mysterious blasts of intense radiation). He has developed some of the most sophisticated computer simulations of supernova explosions and gamma-ray bursts, and his "collapsar" model of gamma-ray bursts is the leading theory explaining how they occur.</p><p>The Bethe Prize recognizes Woosley "for his significant and wide-ranging contributions in the areas of stellar evolution, element synthesis, the theory of core collapse and type Ia supernovae, and the interpretation of gamma-ray bursts--most notably, the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts." The prize, consisting of $7,500 and a certificate, will be presented at the American Physical Society meeting in Tampa, Florida, in April 2005. </p><p>Woosley's work on the evolution of massive stars, which sets the stage for supernova explosions, helps explain how elements like oxygen and iron are formed. A supernova occurs when the core of a star collapses under the gravitational force of its own mass. The resulting explosion can be as bright as an entire galaxy, releasing immense amounts of energy. The explosion also spews into space all of the chemical elements forged by nuclear fusion reactions during the life of the star and some that are formed during the explosion itself. These materials may then contribute to the formation of new stars and planets. </p><p>According to Woosley's collapsar model, gamma-ray bursts arise from the collapse of stars that are too massive to successfully explode as supernovae.</p><p>Woosley is director of the Center for Supernova Research, funded by the Department  of Energy and headquartered at UCSC. He is a co-investigator on the HETE-2 satellite, launched in 2002 to study gamma-ray bursts, and is involved in planning NASA's other missions for gamma-ray astronomy. </p><p>Hans A. Bethe won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1967 for his description of the nuclear processes that power the sun. The previous winner of the Bethe Prize is a UCSC alumnus, Wick Haxton of the University of Washington, who earned his B.A. in physics and mathematics at UCSC in 1971. For Woosley, the Bethe Prize is the second honor connected with this great physicist. In 2002, he was the Hans A. Bethe Distinguished Lecturer at Cornell University, where Bethe was a faculty member. </p><p>Woosley earned his B.A. in physics and Ph.D. in astrophysics from Rice University.

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are involved in both projects.</p>
<p>In the October 21 issue of the journal Nature, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium published its scientific description of the finished human genome sequence, reducing the estimated number of human protein-coding genes from 35,000 to only 20,000 to 25,000, a surprisingly low number for our species. In the paper, researchers describe the final product of the Human Genome Project, the 13-year effort to read the information encoded in the human chromosomes that reached its culmination in 2003.</p>
<p>The Nature publication provides rigorous scientific evidence that the genome sequence produced by the Human Genome Project has both the high coverage and the accuracy needed to perform sensitive analyses, such as those focusing on the number of genes, segmental duplications involved in disease, and the "birth" and "death" of genes over the course of evolution.</p>
<p>"Obtaining the sequence recording our complete genetic heritage has been a huge step for humanity. There is no doubt that this will ultimately transform medicine," said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, who led UCSC's participation in the Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>The other major paper, published in the October 20 issue of the journal Science, outlines the plans of a research consortium organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to produce a comprehensive catalog of all parts of the human genome crucial to biological function. The ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium has the ambitious goal of building a "parts list" of all sequence-based functional elements in the human DNA sequence.</p>
<p>"To really use the human genome sequence for medicine, we need to understand how it works--that is, what all the As, Cs, Gs, and Ts are actually doing in the cells in our bodies. This is much harder than reading the DNA sequence," Haussler said. "Through the ENCODE consortium, the same kind of team approach used in the Human Genome Project is being applied to address this much more difficult challenge."</p>
<p>The list of functional elements compiled by the ENCODE project will include: protein-coding genes; non-protein-coding genes; regulatory elements involved in the control of gene transcription; and DNA sequences that mediate chromosomal structure and dynamics. The ENCODE researchers also anticipate they may uncover additional functional elements that have yet to be recognized.</p>
<p>"Creating this monumental reference work will help us mine and fully utilize the human genome sequence. Such knowledge will lead to a far deeper understanding of human biology and stimulate the development of new strategies for improving human health," said NHGRI Director Francis S. Collins.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz researchers have been involved in the analysis of the human genome since late 1999. James Kent, then a graduate student in molecular, cell, and developmental biology working with Haussler, assembled the first working draft of the human genome in 2000 and created the UCSC Genome Browser, a widely used web-based tool for genomic research. Kent, now a research scientist in UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE), which Haussler directs, is a coauthor on the Science and Nature papers, along with Haussler and other CBSE scientists and graduate students.</p>
<p>The UCSC researchers helped assemble the finished human genome sequence and made it publicly available to researchers worldwide through the UCSC Genome Browser. They also performed a key analysis of the coverage and accuracy of the finished sequence. The browser displays the finished genome in alignment with dozens of annotation tracks contributed by researchers at UCSC and collaborators worldwide.</p>
<p>One of the central goals of the effort to analyze the human genome is the identification of all genes, which are generally defined as stretches of DNA that code for particular proteins. According to the new findings, researchers have confirmed the existence of 19,599 protein-coding genes in the human genome and identified another 2,188 DNA segments that are predicted to be protein-coding genes.</p>
<p>"The analysis found that some of the earlier gene models were erroneous due to defects in the unfinished, draft sequence of the human genome," said Jane Rogers, head of sequencing at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, England. "The task of identifying genes remains challenging, but has been greatly assisted by the finished human genome sequence."</p>
<p>The Nature paper also provides the scientific community with a peer-reviewed description of the finishing process, and an assessment of the quality of the finished human genome sequence, which was deposited into public databases in April 2003. The assessment confirms that the finished sequence now covers more than 99 percent of the euchromatic (or gene-containing) portion of the human genome and was sequenced to an accuracy of 99.999 percent, which translates to an error rate of only 1 base per 100,000 base pairs--10 times more accurate than the original goal.</p>

<p>The contiguity of the sequence is also massively improved. The average DNA letter now sits on a stretch of 38.5 million base pairs of uninterrupted, high-quality sequence--about 475 times longer than the 81,500 base-pair stretch that was available in the working draft. Access to uninterrupted stretches of sequenced DNA can greatly assist researchers hunting for genes and the neighboring DNA sequences that may regulate their activity, dramatically cutting the effort and expense required to find regions of the human genome that may contain small and often rare variants involved in disease.</p>
<p>In addition to reducing the count of human genes, scientists reported that the improved quality of the finished human genome sequence, compared with earlier drafts, provides a much clearer picture of certain phenomena such as duplication of DNA segments and the "birth" and "death" of genes.</p>
<p>Segmental duplications are large, almost identical copies of DNA, which are present in at least two locations in the human genome. A number of human diseases are known to be associated with mutations in segmentally duplicated regions. Segmental duplications also provide a window into understanding how our genome evolved and is still changing.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the finished human genome sequence produced by the Human Genome Project has also given scientists some initial insights into the birth and death of genes in the human genome. Scientists have identified more than 1,000 new genes that arose in the human genome after our divergence with rodents some 75 million years ago. Most of these arose through recent gene duplications and are involved with immune, olfactory, and reproductive functions.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers used the finished human genome to identify and characterize 33 nearly intact genes that have recently acquired one or more mutations, causing them to stop functioning, or "die."</p>
<p>More than 2,800 researchers who took part in the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium share authorship on the Nature paper, which expands upon the group's initial analysis published in February 2001. In addition to Haussler and Kent, coauthors on the Nature paper who are affiliated with UCSC include Robert Baertsch, Hiram Clawson, Mark Diekhans, Terrence Furey, Angela Hinrichs, Fan Hsu, Yontao Lu, Kate Rosenbloom, Krishna Roskin, Adam Siepel, Charles Sugnet, Daryl Thomas, Heather Trumbower, and Ryan Weber.</p>
