The results suggest that drug policies may have less impact on marijuana use than is currently thought.</p><p>The findings appear in the May issue of the <i>American Journal of Public Health.</i> Craig Reinarman, professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, coauthored the article, "The Limited Relevance of Drug Policy: Cannabis in Amsterdam and in San Francisco," with  Peter D. A. Cohen, director of the Centre for Drug Research (CEDRO) at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and Hendrien L. Kaal, now an instructor at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands.</p><p>The study compared the cannabis (marijuana and hashish) habits of users in Amsterdam and San Francisco to test the premise that punishment for cannabis use deters use and thereby benefits public health.</p><p>"We compared representative samples of experienced marijuana users to see whether the lawful availability of marijuana did, in fact, lead to the problems critics of the Dutch system have claimed," said Reinarman. "We found no evidence that it does. In fact, we found consistently strong similarities in patterns of marijuana use, despite vastly different national drug policies."</p><p>Highlights of the study include:</p><p>. The mean age at onset of use was 16.95 years in Amsterdam and 16.43 years in San Francisco</p><p>. The mean age at which respondents began using marijuana more than once per month was 19.11 years in Amsterdam and 18.81 years in San Francisco.</p><p>. In both cities, users began their periods of maximum use about 2 years after they began regular use: 21.46 years in Amsterdam and 21.98 years in San Francisco.</p><p>. About 75 percent in both cities had used cannabis less than once per week or not at all in the year before the interview.</p><p>. Majorities of experienced users in both cities never used marijuana daily or in large amounts even during their periods of peak use, and use declined after those peak periods.</p><p>The Netherlands effectively decriminalized marijuana use in 1976, and it is available for purchase in small quantities by adults in licensed coffee shops; in the United States, marijuana use carries stiff criminal penalties, and more than 720,000 people were arrested for marijuana offenses in 2001.</p><p>The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Dutch Ministry of Health.</p><p>In identical questionnaires administered in Amsterdam and San Francisco (cities chosen for their similarities as politically liberal northern port cities with universities and populations of roughly 700,000 people), nearly 500 respondents who had used marijuana at least 25 times were asked detailed questions about their marijuana use. The questionnaire explored such issues as age at first use, regular and maximum use, frequency and quantity of use over time, intensity and duration of intoxication, career use patterns, and use of other illicit drugs. </p><p> "In the United States, marijuana policy is based on the assertion that strict penalties are the best way to inhibit use," said Reinarman. </p><p>The study's findings cast doubt on that scenario, he said. Despite widespread lawful availability of cannabis in Amsterdam, there were no differences between the two cities in age at onset of use, age at first regular use, or age at the start of maximum use. </p><p>The study found no evidence that lawfully regulated cannabis provides a "gateway" to other illicit drug use. In fact, marijuana users in San Francisco were far more likely to have used other illicit drugs--cocaine, crack, amphetamines, ecstasy, and opiates--than users in Amsterdam, said Reinarman. </p><p>"The results of this study shift the burden of proof now to those who would arrest hundreds of thousands of Americans each year on the grounds that it deters use," said Reinarman. </p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Craig Reinarman may be reached at (831) 459-2617 or craigo@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914daab08072704601a012ffc09f188a"><name>495</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: UC Santa Cruz and community colleges will launch new program for engineering students with a reception at NASA Ames on May 5</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1083567600000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: UC Santa...</display-name><path>/2004/05/495</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/495</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338040446</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338040446</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Collaborative for Higher Education, the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the Foothill-De Anza Community College District will hold a reception to celebrate the launch of their <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=487">new program</a> to help students prepare for careers in engineering.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Reporters are invited to attend this event</font></b></td></tr></table>Funded by a $2 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the Developing Effective Engineering Pathways (DEEP) program gives community college students the guidance and preparation they need to transfer into engineering programs at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, and supports transfer students at UCSC with services and programs to ensure that they successfully complete a four-year degree.</p><p><b>When:</b> Wednesday, May 5, from 5 to 7 p.m.</p><p><b>Where:</b> The Mars Center, NASA Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA</p><p><b>Who:</b> Speakers will include</p><p>.

Dynes, is a first in the University of California system. UC Santa Cruz will begin enrolling students for fall 2005.</p><p>	Unlike other graduate programs in communications and visual arts, the UCSC program will integrate rigorous social scientific analysis of people's lives and cultures with the development of tools that will enable students to reach nonacademic audiences. </p><p>"Social documentation, in all its forms, can be a powerful tool for social change," said Mary Beth Pudup, chair of the UCSC Community Studies Department, which will offer the new master's program. "We want to prepare students to produce the highest-quality documentaries by emphasizing rigorous social and historical analysis. This program is a way to bridge the gap between the ivory tower and social activism by recognizing the power of documentary media to integrate the two."</p><p>Specifically, students on the path to a master of arts degree in social documentation will engage in critical thinking about social problems and prepare documentaries suitable for presentation to broad audiences. In addition to documentary films and videos, students will produce oral histories; audio productions; photographic essays; historic presentations; Internet; CDV and CD-ROM programs and digital archives; and written ethnographies.</p><p>	</p><p>In an April 1 letter to UC President Dynes recommending approval of the new program, former UCSC Chancellor M.R.C.

Modeled after a tradition of theater festivals that began at Lake Chautauqua, New York, more than a century ago, the annual campus event has now helped teach students how to produce, direct, write, and star in dramatic productions for two and a half decades. </p><p>The UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Department will celebrate a significant milestone this year when it presents the 25th annual Chautauqua Festival, beginning on Thursday, May 13, and running for two weeks at the campus Theater Arts Center. All performances are free and open to the public.</p><p>"To me, it's the truest training ground for the future of theater that we can provide," noted Gregory Fritsch, a lecturer in theater arts who has overseen numerous presentations of Chautauqua since his first foray as festival director back in 1989. "It presents a practical and successful model of mentoring fellow artists and provides a comprehensive training arena for all aspects of theater--design, directing, playwriting, acting." </p><p>Perhaps the greatest asset of Chautauqua is that it provides a showcase for new dramatic writing. The festival offers students a remarkable chance to have their own original plays developed and produced under the direction of other students. </p><p>"It provides our students with opportunities that exist in very few undergraduate programs in the country, and serves as an incentive for students hungry to get their work out in front of an audience," observed award-winning playwright and UCSC theater arts professor James Bierman. </p><p>Bierman noted that four students who have had work produced in the Chautauqua Festival have gone on to win the prestigious Nicholl Fellowship of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, "making UCSC the most successful producer of dramatic writers of any university program in the country in the academy's eyes," he added.</p><p>The original Chautauqua Festival worked from eight scripts that were created by students in Bierman's 1979 theater arts playwriting workshop. </p><p>"The first evening began with a real tour-de-force production of a two-minute piece that featured an actor in a hazardous materials suit who cut down a potted geranium with a chainsaw," Bierman recalled. "That was the shortest piece on the program. The longest was a one-hour-and-twenty-minute drama by a gifted student named Philip Heim, who went on to direct in New York City."  </p><p>  </p><p>During the 1980s, the festival evolved and expanded in various experimental directions, adding short dance pieces and student films, and increasing the number of dramatic productions. One year, the festival closed with a 13-hour marathon that began on Sunday at noon and ended at two in the morning. "It was amazing how many students endured the whole thing in one sitting," said Bierman. </p><p>Today, nearly 150 students devote themselves each year to running the festival, spending vast quantities of time covering all aspects of theater production. Bierman said that in recent years, the festival has become more disciplined than it was in the past, noting that the quality of the productions has increased measurably despite limited financial resources. </p><p>This year's festival will feature 12 original scripts, ranging from a stage adaptation of George Orwell's 1984, to a production combining African folklore and modern puppetry. The schedule includes:</p><p><b>Program A - Second Stage</b></p><p>Let's Say 'OK'- A Zombie Play</p><p>Written by Chris Webster</p><p>Directed by Troy Delaney</p><p>What happens when a future Shogun, a cross-dressing girl, and a horrifying zombie join the Roman army?

The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Marcy leads the world's most prolific team of planet hunters, having discovered more than 70 of the roughly 100 currently known extrasolar planets (planets outside our solar system). His team includes UCSC astronomer Steven Vogt, who was Marcy's adviser when he earned his Ph.D. at UCSC in 1982. </p><p>The dozens of new worlds discovered around nearby stars in the past eight years display a diversity of characteristics and environments far beyond scientists' expectations. The planets' unexpected  properties, together with the latest discoveries in biology here on Earth, cast a new light on the prospects for both primitive and intelligent life in the universe, Marcy says.</p><p>Marcy's research has focused on the detection of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. The discoveries by Marcy and his team have allowed astronomers to study the masses, radii, and orbits of a diverse array of extrasolar planets. Among these planets are the first multiple-planet solar system besides our own, the first Saturn-like planets, and the first transiting planet (passing in front of its star, producing a slight dimming effect detectable from Earth). </p><p>In addition to his position on the UC Berkeley faculty, Marcy is an adjunct professor of physics and astronomy at San Francisco State University. His ongoing research focuses on the mass distribution of planets and the eccentricity of their orbits. Marcy is the director of Berkeley's new Center for Integrative Planetary Science, a research unit formed to study the formation, geophysics, chemistry, and evolution of planets. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the recipient of numerous awards, including Discover magazine's Space Scientist of the Year in 2003, the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, the Carl Sagan Award, the Beatrice Tinsley Prize, and the Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p>Marcy's talk is the fourth Halliday Lecture, a public lecture series sponsored by the UCSC Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. The Halliday Lecture Series is made possible through the generous support of John Halliday to promote public awareness and appreciation for astronomy and astrophysics.</p><p>For more information about the lecture, contact the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at (831) 459-3581.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914db1e88072704601a012ff23353a92"><name>499</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Surprising 'ultra-conserved' regions discovered in human genome</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-3077, stephens@ucsc.edu; Branwyn Wagman (831) 459-3077, bwagman@soe.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1083826800000</start-date><display-name>Surprising 'ultra-conserved' regions discovered...</display-name><path>/2004/05/499</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/499</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338042142</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1643405872600</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers comparing the human genome with the genomes of other species have discovered a surprising number of matching DNA sequences in a variety of vertebrate species, including the mouse, rat, dog, and chicken. The fact that these sequences have remained unchanged over long periods of evolutionary history indicates that they are biologically important, but for now their functions are largely a mystery.</p>
<p>Published May 6 by Science Express (the online edition of the journal Science), these findings are the joint work of Gill Bejerano, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz; David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; UCSC research scientist W. James Kent; and a team of researchers from the University of Queensland in Australia.</p>
<p>By scanning the human, rat, and mouse genomes for matching regions of 200 or more DNA bases (As, Cs, Gs, and Ts), the researchers found 481 regions that were completely unchanged. All of the unchanged regions, referred to as "ultra-conserved elements," were also found in the dog and chicken genomes, and two-thirds of them were found in the fish genome. But they could not be traced beyond the fish to nonvertebrate species whose genomes have been sequenced, such as the sea squirt, fly, and worm.</p>
<p>"As far as we can tell, most of these ultra-conserved elements showed up during the evolution of vertebrates, perhaps during the period when land animals emerged, or a bit earlier. But their early evolutionary history is still mysterious," Haussler said.</p>
<p>Although they have been conserved meticulously through hundreds of millions of years of evolution, only a small fraction of these elements code for proteins. Protein coding, whereby DNA code directs the production of a specific protein, is how most genes carry out their functions. But fewer than a quarter of the ultra-conserved elements overlap coding regions of the human genome, and in most of those cases they overlap only a short span of the coding region and extend beyond it to noncoding areas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most of the 481 ultra-conserved elements appear to be associated in some way with genes, if not overlapping them then residing near genes or in the noncoding portions of genes. Furthermore, they tend to be associated with parts of the genome that are involved in regulating the expression of genes in various ways.</p>
<p>"These parts of the genome are far more conserved than we would have imagined. We think these segments evolved in the past, then froze into place and were inherited unchanged from then on," Bejerano said.</p>
<p>More than half of the ultra-conserved elements that overlap coding regions are associated with genes that take more than one form, depending on how they are transcribed to RNA. Through a process known as alternative splicing, different parts of a gene may be spliced out under different circumstances, so that a single gene can produce several different proteins. Bejerano thinks the association of ultra-conserved elements with alternatively spliced genes is significant.</p>
<p>"It's a cautious hypothesis that these elements may cause some type of interaction to determine what part of the gene will be spliced out," he said.</p>
<p>The ultra-conserved elements that do not overlap with any coding region tend to be found in regions of the genome that are associated with gene regulation, the transcription of DNA to RNA, or the binding of regulatory proteins to the DNA.</p>
<p>"There was some speculation among biologists as to whether we would find new kinds of things when we sequenced the complete genomes of animals, including our own genome, or if it would just be more of the same kinds of things that were already known. Well, it's not just more of the same," Haussler said.</p>
<p>The discovery of ultra-conserved elements in the human genome came from investigating the 5 percent of the genome known to be highly conserved between the human, mouse, and rat. Most of this highly conserved DNA--3.5 percent of the genome--is in noncoding regions and has no known purpose. Bejerano and his colleagues sought to find functional elements within that 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>"We began by looking for meaningful families within these conserved, noncoding elements," he said.</p>
<p>Some of them fell into clusters of at least two elements with a common genomic ancestor. These were most likely duplications within one genome that were retained and modified over time. In one such family, the different elements within the human genome were 80 to 90 percent similar, while each human element was 96 percent similar to the corresponding elements in the mouse and rat genomes.</p>
<p>Because 96 percent agreement between the similar elements in two species was surprisingly high, the researchers wondered if they could find other areas of such agreement. They did, and eventually looked for 100 percent agreement, which uncovered the 481 ultra-conserved segments that were the focus of this research.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the human, mouse, and rat genomes for earlier evidence of these ultra-conserved elements, the researchers found that 97 percent of them can be aligned with similar regions in the chicken with 95 percent agreement, even though only 4 percent of the human genome can be aligned with the chicken genome at all. Human and chicken lines are thought to have diverged about 300 million years ago. In the fugu fish, which diverged from the human line more than 400 million years ago, two-thirds of the ultra-conserved regions could be aligned with 77 percent similarity.</p>
<p>Because they were not able to trace the ultra-conserved segments to even more distant species, the authors speculate that these particular parts of the genome represent innovations in the genomes of chordate species that evolved rapidly at first, then became effectively frozen in birds and mammals.</p>
<p>"These ultra-conserved elements are long, they evolved rather rapidly, and they are now evolutionarily frozen. We don't know of a biomolecular mechanism that would explain them," Haussler said.</p>
<p>When the researchers compared individuals within the human population, they also found little variation in these ultra-conserved elements. To determine this, the team combed the conserved elements for genome variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are changes in individual genomes that are often used in genetic testing to distinguish one human from another. They found 20-fold fewer SNPs in the conserved regions than would have occurred if SNPs were randomly sprinkled throughout the genome.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the rate of change that has occurred in these regions when compared with other species also appears to be 20-fold less than expected, supporting the idea that the conserved elements evolve 20 times slower than does the genome as a whole.</p>
<p>The only other part of the genome having a level of conservation approaching that of these ultra-conserved elements is the DNA that codes for ribosomes and their actions in the cells. Ribosomes are complex molecular machines made of RNA and proteins. They translate the genetic code to carry out protein synthesis in all cells. According to Bejerano, ribosomal sequences are highly conserved because they are essential to all forms of life.</p>
<p>"Ribosomes are crucial. If anything goes wrong with them, the organism will not survive," he said.</p>
<p>The DNA sequences that code for ribosomal RNA contain long stretches of bases that are perfectly conserved throughout evolution. Unlike the ultra-conserved elements uncovered in this study, though, ribosomal RNA is ancient and is common to all species.</p>
<p>"The ultra-conserved elements are not nearly as old as the previously known conserved elements in the ribosomal RNA, which is truly ancient and fundamental to all branches of life," Haussler noted.</p>
<p>In addition to Bejerano, Haussler, and Kent, the coauthors on the new paper include University of Queensland researchers Michael Pheasant, Igor Makunin, Stuart Stephen, and John Mattick.</p>
<p>The work at UC Santa Cruz on ultra-conserved elements in the human genome was supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Cancer Institute, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>

After he passed away on February 2, 2003, Harrison's will designated the campus as the site for all of his remaining artistic materials, including his extensive collection of musical instruments.</p><p>"The Grateful Dead all knew and recognized the contributions of Lou Harrison, and they performed on programs with him and Michael Tilson Thomas at the San Francisco Symphony," noted Fredric Lieberman, professor of music at UC Santa Cruz and co-author with UCSC professor Leta Miller of <i>Lou Harrison: Composing a World,</i> a biography published by Oxford University Press in 1998 (paperback reissue, University of Illinois Press, 2004). A CD of Harrison's music included in that publication was made possible by the generosity of Phil Lesh and David Gans, who edited and mastered the disc.</p><p>Internationally recognized for his highly inventive and original work, Harrison was the last living link in a tradition of American experimental music that includes Charles Ives, Henry Cowell, Virgil Thomson, and John Cage. He is most well known for his fusion of Asian and Western musical styles and development of new percussion instruments. Harrison left behind a legacy of more than 300 compositions, and his music was frequently featured over the past decade in San Francisco Symphony programs, as well as on the San Francisco record label New Albion.</p><p>Lieberman approached both foundations for assistance after learning that Harrison's estate might be forced to sell archival materials to meet remaining taxes and legal costs. He hoped to enable the UC Santa Cruz library to purchase the most essential and endangered archival material from the estate in an effort to maintain the fullest possible integrity of the archive. </p><p>The UC Santa Cruz archive currently includes more than 600 reel-to-reel tapes that date as far back as 1949, containing personal copies of performances of Harrison's music that are almost all unreleased. It also contains some unique one-off acetate disks of recordings by the Harrison and Cage percussion ensemble in the early 1940s, which need immediate attention and preservation.</p><p>"When I learned of the perilous state of the Harrison archive and the potential danger that it might have to be sold, I immediately asked both foundations for assistance," Lieberman said. "The Rex Foundation has recently begun funding projects involving digital preservation, and this is one project they responded to."</p><p> "In recent years, the Dead have explored technology in their own recordings and looked at the problems of archiving the music in their own vault," Lieberman noted. "Mickey Hart was also recently appointed to the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, where he leads a committee on the digitization and preservation of the center's huge collections." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914db87e8072704601a012ff61d48b1f"><name>502</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Governor's 'May revision' restores some funding to UC, adds Cal Grant money to cover fee increases</title><author>Brad Hayward: (510) 987-9091, &lt;a href=</author><start-date>1084431600000</start-date><display-name>Governor's 'May revision' restores...</display-name><path>/2004/05/502</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/502</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338043966</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338043966</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued the May Revision to his original state budget proposal for 2004-05 today (May 13), protecting the University of California from additional state budget cuts and restoring $20 million in previously cut funding to the university.</p>

The May Revision also includes funding for the California Student Aid Commission to provide Cal Grants that cover the proposed 14 percent undergraduate student fee increase at UC. The governor's original state budget proposal did not increase Cal Grants to cover fee increases.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Under the governor's original budget, issued in January, UC's state-funded operating budget would fall from $2.9 billion to $2.67 billion, or 8 percent. The May Revision makes the following technical adjustments to the original January proposal:</p>

<p>. Restores $8 million based on a recalculation of the number of enrolled students.</p>
<p>. Restores $8.2 million based on an assumption that the governor's proposal for an "excess-unit fee" will be phased in over time, producing less immediate savings. The governor's January proposal was that undergraduates taking more than 110 percent of the credit hours required for graduation be charged at a higher fee rate.</p>
<p>. Restores $4 million in UC internal funds (nonresident tuition revenue) used for K-12 outreach programs. This money was counted as state funds in the January budget and actually is part of the $12 million in internal funds that UC is putting up to sustain outreach in 2004-05. Negotiations over state funding for outreach are expected to be part of budget discussions between the Legislature and governor in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The governor's decision not to make additional cuts at UC beyond those proposed in January follows a "compact" announced Tuesday (5/11) by Gov. Schwarzenegger, UC President Robert C. Dynes, and California State University Chancellor Charles B. Reed. The compact will provide, over the years 2005-06 to 2010-11, budget stability and moderate growth for UC and CSU. Details on the compact are at <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/compact/welcome.html">www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/compact/welcome.html</a>.</p>

<p>Because the state of California is still grappling with a major budget gap for 2004-05, however, most of the governor's January proposals for budget cuts at UC remain in place. They include cuts to enrollments, administration, research, and other programs. The January cuts are described in full at <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2004/jan09a.htm">www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2004/jan09a.htm</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the governor's budget continues to provide no state funding for cost-of-living increases for UC faculty and staff in 2004-05, though the new compact does offer funding for increases beginning in the 2005-06 year.</p>

<p>The May Revision also continues to propose student fee increases for 2004-05, though they have been modified from the governor's January proposal to reflect the compact announced Tuesday. The governor's current proposals on student fees include:</p>

<p>. Graduate fees: An increase of 20 percent ($1,050) in 2004-05. This is half the 40 percent increase proposed in the January budget.</p>
<p>. Undergraduate fees: An increase of 14 percent ($700) in 2004-05, up from 10 percent in the January budget to allow the 40 percent graduate fee increase to be reduced. (Under the compact, undergraduate fees would rise an average 10 percent over the next three years, meaning that fee increases in both 2005-06 and 2006-07 would be 8 percent.)</p>
<p>. Nonresident tuition: An increase of 20 percent ($2,746 for undergraduates and $2,449 for academic graduate students), unchanged from the governor's January budget proposal. Out-of-state students pay regular fees in addition to nonresident tuition.</p>

<p>The UC Board of Regents is expected to vote on 2004-05 fee levels and a 2004-05 budget plan at its May 19-20 meeting.</p>

<p>Professional school fees were not specifically set in the January budget, the compact, or the May Revision. However, the governor's January proposal, which remains in place, is to reduce state support for most UC professional schools (excluding nursing) by an average of 25 percent and to replace the lost revenue through student fees.

The soulful music spoke to their struggles following the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p><p>	The blues has a unique power to ease suffering and give hope to the downtrodden, says political scientist--and lifelong blues fan--Michael Urban, author of the new book <i>Russia Gets the Blues: Music, Culture, and Community in Unsettled Times</i> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2004). </p><p>	"The distinctive sound of the blues conveys both raw feelings and subtle emotional shadings," says Urban, a professor of politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Russians 'get' the blues. It resonates with their experience."</p><p>	Since the fall of communism in 1991, Russians have had to cope with enormous social upheaval and displacement. Like blacks in the United States, they've had to rely on their own hope and individual determination amidst circumstances that offer little reason for optimism, says Urban. </p><p>	"Like the blues aesthetic itself, Russians have summoned the will to surmount their troubles and endure," said Urban. "There is an optimism at the heart of the blues that reaches deep into the Russian spirit. It's a kind of food for their souls."</p><p>	Based on interviews with scores of Russian blues musicians, fans, and promoters in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia Gets the Blues captures the appeal of American-style blues, as described by this enthusiast:</p><p>I like the idea of waking up with a terrible hangover, finding all my money and my woman gone, and thinking: "This isn't so bad." Blues is like that; experiencing terrible things but at the same time surviving them, and knowing that you are able to survive them. It makes you feel good about yourself.</p><p>						--Sergei Mitrokhin, politician</p><p>Urban, an expert on the Russian political system and an amateur blues guitarist, collaborated on the book with Moscow music promoter and radio disc jockey Andrei Evdokimov. The blues craze took hold when it did because its sound--rooted in the African American experience nearly a century earlier, resonated with Russians--despite their inability to understand the English lyrics, said Urban. The blues craze grew until the Russian financial crash of 1998.</p><p>"I'm certainly not the first to say that the blues is powerfully emotive music, with hollering, screaming, and moaning," said Urban. "When you think about the history of the blues in this country and in Russia, politics are very present in the music. The blues is a powerful political force."</p><p>Music's political power is perhaps most evident in the message of racial tolerance embedded in the Russian blues community. "Russia is a very racist place, despite the fact that the Soviet regime lectured against racism for 70 years," said Urban. Blues players, by contrast, combat racism through their reverence for the music and the suffering of the people who started it, said Urban. "Because they associate with blacks, they're saying, 'We don't recognize racism.' It's a new role model for people, and that's part of social change."</p><p>The blues also offered a welcome alternative to the bland Western-style pop music that was filling the airwaves--and filling many Russians with disdain, said Urban. Distinguishing themselves from the discredited Soviet past, these new converts embraced the blues and vowed to protect it from the crass commercialization of capitalism. </p><p>	</p><p>A few Russian musicians have begun writing their own blues songs, but the "blues boom" collapsed in August 1998, when the Russian ruble lost two-thirds of its value in three weeks. Many of Moscow's nightclubs were forced to close, and the shortage of venues for live performances undermined the fan base. But two of the capital's biggest radio stations continue to broadcast blues shows every week, and Urban says hard-core fans and players are keeping the music alive.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Michael Urban can be reached at (831) 459-3153 or via e-mail at urban47@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dbb188072704601a012ff9bfe0658"><name>504</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Enrollment procedures changing for continuing students</title><author>Bonita Sebastian: bonitas@cruzmail.ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1084863600000</start-date><display-name>Enrollment procedures changing for...</display-name><path>/2004/05/504</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/504</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338044648</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338044648</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Information Office</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Continuing students will enroll in fall 2004 classes using the new UCSC Academic Information System (AIS).

Scott Hubbard, who was the first NASA Mars program director and served as the sole NASA representative on the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, will speak at UC Santa Cruz on June 3.</p><p>Hubbard will speak on "Space Exploration: The Moon and Mars--A Vision of the Future," for the spring UCSC Foundation Forum, at 3:30 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. The lecture is free and open to the public.</p><p>A faculty panel discussion will follow, featuring:</p><p>. David Deamer, professor and acting chair of biomolecular engineering, whose research includes astrobiology and the origins of life;</p><p>. Gabriel Elkaim, assistant professor of computer engineering, who conducts research in robotics;</p><p>. Ali Shakouri, associate professor of electrical engineering, whose research includes energy conversion applications.</p><p>In 2000, Hubbard was called to NASA headquarters, where he served as the first Mars program director. Hubbard's success in redefining all robotic Mars missions in response to the Mars failures in 1999 earned him the title "Mars czar" in some circles. The Mars Odyssey mission, launched during Hubbard's tenure, is now successfully collecting data on Mars.</p><p>Hubbard has been a contributor to, and developer of, space research missions since 1974. He is acknowledged as the originator of the Mars Pathfinder mission and was the project manager for the Ames portion of that mission, which successfully landed on Mars July 4, 1997. He was NASA's manager for the Lunar Prospector Mission that launched on January 6, 1998, and discovered evidence of water ice at both the north and south poles of the Moon. Hubbard has been widely acknowledged for introducing private-sector concepts, such as integrated product teams, into NASA's operational activities. In addition, he has developed experimental hardware for numerous investigations, including balloon experiments, Apollo-Soyuz, and other space science missions.</p><p>NASA Ames Research Center is located at Moffett Field in the heart of Silicon Valley. It specializes in research geared toward creating new knowledge and new technologies that span the spectrum of National Aeronautics and Space Administration interests.</p><p>NASA Ames and UCSC are collaborating in the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) established in 2003 under a 10-year, $330 million contract between UC and NASA. Scientists at NASA Ames and UCSC will work together on research that is critical to achieving success in NASA missions. The institutions will also collaborate on developing technologies to improve the quality of life on Earth and on cutting-edge education programs.</p><p>The Foundation Forum lecture series brings together UCSC Foundation trustees, faculty, and students annually to hear engaging speakers and participate in discussions on current subjects that affect their common interests and goals. Shuttle service to the forum is available from the Barn Theater parking lot beginning at 3 p.m.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dc1df8072704601a012ffb796ac66"><name>509</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CANCELLED: Supervising producer of Fahrenheit 911 and Bowling for Columbine speaks at UC Santa Cruz June 3</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1085468400000</start-date><display-name>CANCELLED: Supervising producer of...</display-name><path>/2004/05/509</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/509</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338046383</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338046383</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Documentary filmmaker Tia Lessin, supervising producer of Michael Moore's new documentary Fahrenheit 911, will give a free public lecture on Thursday, June 3, at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

An accomplished filmmaker in her own right, Lessin has been part of Moore's team for almost 10 years, working as supervising producer on Fahrenheit 911, which just took the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Oscar-winning Bowling for Columbine. She was coordinating producer of The Big One, and won two Emmy Award nominations--and one arrest--for her work as senior producer of The Awful Truth. Lessin was also a segment producer on the Emmy Award-winning TV Nation.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Lessin has produced and directed her own documentaries, including Behind the Labels about sweatshops in the United States, for which she received the 2002 Sidney Hillman Award for broadcast journalism. Her film A Family Divided tells the story of a Pakistani truck driver who remains jailed following his arrest by the FBI after September 11.</p>
<p>Among her other film credits, Lessin was co-producer of the Academy Award-nominated Shadows of Hate, distributed free to high schools around the country as part of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Teaching Tolerance Curriculum.</p>
<p>Lessin is a graduate of Cornell University and a former labor organizer.</p>
<p>Lessin's visit is being sponsored by the UCSC Community Studies Department. In addition to the lecture, she will be meeting with UCSC faculty and students interested in documentary and social change.

But by doing research at UCSC on that conflict during the midst of recent intense media coverage of the war in Iraq, he has discovered remarkable similarities between the two events. </p><p>Smith is a 33-year-old armed forces veteran himself-he served in the United States Marine Corps from 1997 to 2002 and studied Russian at the Defense Department's Language Institute in Monterey. Smith is also the winner of this year's Melkonian Prize for submitting the top proposal to UCSC's 2003-04 Humanities Undergraduate Research Awards (HUGRA). </p><p>Smith's project is titled "The Soldiers' Rebellion in Vietnam: Race, Class, and Resistance." He will present his research on Thursday, June 3, along with four other HUGRA award-winning students at the Merrill College Baobab Room between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.</p><p>"I got inspired by an essay I had read about the fact that in Vietnam, it got to the point where morale was so low, that troops refused to fight," Smith recalled. "I had never heard this part of history before. So I began researching and learned that there has been resistance to every war we have ever fought. But in Vietnam the resistance to fight was on a scale never before seen by the U.S. Military-and it was documented in written reports by the armed forces."</p><p>Smith began looking for the reasons why resistance in Vietnam was so much larger than in previous wars. He found that one cause was the contradiction between official U.S. policy and what the government claimed was occurring in Vietnam, and what the troops were actually encountering on the ground.</p><p>"We were told the troops would be greeted in Vietnam as liberators and not met with hostility," Smith noted. "The troops were told they were fighting communism, but in reality they found they were just fighting poor peasants who were starving-they were just subsistence farmers."</p><p>Smith also found that Vietnam was different because it was a working-class war due to college deferments-blacks and Latinos served disproportionately on the front lines. He additionally discovered details of the impact of the anti-war movement that he had been completely unaware of, including the existence of hundreds of underground newspapers that were utilized to help build an anti-war GI movement.</p><p>"There were over 250 underground newspapers--many produced by soldiers, sailors, and airmen themselves--that circulated stateside, and several thousand were known to have reached the troops stationed in Vietnam," Smith said. "I've obtained numerous copies of these papers--it's fascinating how widespread their circulation was." </p><p>Smith's project suggests that Vietnam should be considered as part of the broader history of labor and the working class. He argues that it was a working-class revolt that helped to end the Vietnam ground war. "The military was the largest employer of working-class people at that time, and the soldiers' revolt was one of the most successful social movements of the period," Smith noted.  He added that major reforms were also instituted after Vietnam in response to this working-class rebellion--the draft was ended, military policies and regulations were liberalized, and pay for enlisted soldiers almost doubled. </p><p>"It's important that we learn about Vietnam because of so many comparisons to situations going on today," Smith observed. "Especially now with the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, because a similar thing happened with the My Lai incident--it ripped the mask off what the U.S. was doing, leading many to question whether My Lai was an isolated incident or an example of systematic and widespread abuse."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dc60f8072704601a012ff37bb11e8"><name>512</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists will discuss marine animals and human noise in a free lecture at Seymour Center</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1085641200000</start-date><display-name>Scientists will discuss marine...</display-name><path>/2004/05/512</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/512</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338047454</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338047454</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The effects of human noise on marine animals is the subject of a special presentation by three marine mammal experts on Thursday, June 3, from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory.

Their talks are part of a nationwide lecture series sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries).</p><p>Southall, who earned his Ph.D. in ocean sciences at UCSC studying hearing in seals and sea lions, will give an introduction on the subject of human-produced sound in the marine environment. Southall has been traveling around the country since March as part of the NOAA Fisheries lecture series, which aims to present the public with current scientific information on marine animals and human noise. The series will continue through November. </p><p>Kastak, who earned a Ph.D. in biology at UCSC, will talk about the physics of sound and hearing in the ocean and the effects of human-produced noises, mostly in relation to pinnipeds (seals and sea lions). Kastak has studied the hearing abilities of different pinniped species and the effects of human-produced noise on pinnipeds. He leads an ongoing research program on pinniped acoustics at Long Marine Lab, and is also involved in research with the U.S. Navy's marine mammal program.</p><p>Croll will discuss the role of sound in the lives of the great whales and how the noise created by human activities in the ocean might affect those animals. Croll has studied the loud, low-frequency sounds produced by fin whales and blue whales, gaining new insights into how and why the whales use these vocalizations. He has also done research on how whales respond to human-produced noises.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d4c208072704601a012ff202b3d5a"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626374620</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626374620</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d4c208072704601a012ff202b3d5a"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/05/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626374620</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626374620</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
