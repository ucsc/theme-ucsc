The public workshop on February 25 will take place from 6 to 9 p.m. in the Sierra Room of the UCSC Inn, located at 611 Ocean Street in Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
<p>Designed to provide an overview of the current planning progress, the February 25 meeting will be facilitated by UCSC's long-range planning consultant--Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners--and will present preliminary enrollment scenarios for early testing. There will also be a discussion of how the LRDP will address sustainability. "This will be a real opportunity for the community to get a close look at the initial stage of our LRDP planning," said Frank Zwart, UCSC's associate vice chancellor for physical planning and construction.</p>
<p>Within the University of California system, LRDPs are drafted to support the academic goals of individual campuses; they also take into account projected statewide enrollment demand.</p>
<p>Upon their completion, the long-range plans define a building program and a land-use map that serve as a comprehensive planning framework for capital construction, infrastructure, and land-use programs. LRDPs, however, are not implementation plans, Zwart said, and adoption of an LRDP does not constitute a commitment to specific projects, construction schedules, or funding priorities.</p>
<p>The process that began this past fall will produce UCSC's fifth Long Range Development Plan, following plans that were adopted in 1963 (two years before the campus opened), 1971, 1978, and 1988.</p>
<p>A major influence on the new LRDP will be ideas that emerge from a parallel campus planning effort: the work of UCSC's Strategic Futures Committee, charged with identifying the range of academic and research programs that may emerge in the campus's future.</p>
<p>UCSC officials decided to use the year 2020 as the end of the planning horizon because that time frame will be aligned with the city of Santa Cruz's comparable planning document, its General Plan, also soon to be updated.</p>
<p>According to a schedule that has been developed by campus officials, during the current academic year the campus's academic vision will be updated and LRDP public workshops will take place. In the 2004-05 year, a draft LRDP will be completed and work will begin on a draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the LRDP. In the 2005-06 year, the draft EIR will be presented to the public for comments, and the LRDP and EIR will be submitted to UC's Board of Regents for final consideration.</p>

But it is the opportunity to finally perform at the mission that excites Paiement the most. </p><p>"It's a beautiful space; I think the walls are meant to have music within them," observed Paiement, the conductor of UCSC's acclaimed choral ensemble since 1988. </p><p>"I've always wanted to bring the Chamber Singers to the Carmel Mission because it's a great place acoustically to sing, and there's an audience nearby that enjoys early music. And I'm also very interested in establishing a musical rapport between UCSC and that part of Monterey Bay," she added.</p><p>Paiement noted that every building brings a different texture to live music, depending on the materials used in its construction. "Because the mission is a combination of wood and stone, it will bring a very warm color to the sound," she said. "It's such an inspiring place. It's a building from an earlier time, and we are bringing music from an earlier time--so the setting fits."</p><p>But the same qualities that make the Carmel Mission such a grand and majestic concert venue also present the biggest challenges for UCSC's choral ensemble. </p><p>"Voices will float very beautifully there," Paiement said. "But because there is a lot of reverberation, the singers have to work on having extra clear diction and enunciation--otherwise it just becomes a big wash of sound." </p><p>"To prepare for the delay of sound, the vocalists must also sing extremely rhythmically," she added. "They need to practice singing on the beat and also be very aware of articulation--how long each note is held." </p><p>A great deal of the repertoire that will be performed at the February concert was not originally sung by choirs, but rather by one singer for each harmony part. But over the years, choral tradition has made it acceptable for larger ensembles to perform these compositions. Although the UCSC ensemble will have six people singing on each harmony line, the goal is to create a sonic texture that will be as light and transparent as just four voices singing in harmony. </p><p>"Musical enjoyment is what we're aiming for," Paiement observed. "It's not pretentious music--it definitely won't be heavy or difficult to listen to."</p><p>The upcoming performance will include a difficult composition that requires the Chamber Singers to re-create the sound of birds. </p><p>"We plan to perform a Renaissance piece titled Le Chant des Oiseaux by Clement Janequin," Paiement noted. "This is a popular work that is technically challenging for an ensemble since it involves imitating bird calls. When well executed, the audience members feel as if they are surrounded by birds."</p><p>In addition to her role as conductor of UCSC's Orchestra and Chamber Singers, Paiement is the founding artistic director of the California Parallele Ensemble, which specializes in performing contemporary music, as well as compositions by lesser-known composers of other periods. Founded in 1994, it is now the resident professional ensemble of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. Paiement will travel with several members of the ensemble to Australia this summer for a series of concerts. </p><p>Paiement is also the founder of the BluePrint Project in San Francisco, a series of new music concerts and collaborations, which she began last year in an effort to promote contemporary music from around the world.  </p><p>Paiement recently traveled to Seoul, Korea, where she conducted the world premier of Chan-Hae Lee's opera Back to the Origin. She has also recently guest-conducted the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, Ensemble Kochi of Japan, and the Monterey Jazz Festival Orchestra. Paiement's work can be heard on more than 20 CDs on such labels as Helicon and New Albion Records.  </p><p>The UCSC Chamber Singers will perform at the Carmel Mission on Saturday, February 21, at 8 p.m. Tickets are $10 general, $8 seniors, $6 students, available in advance at the UCSC Ticket Office, (831) 459-2159.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d68468072704601a012ff4a5dfd91"><name>450</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to hold public hearing on draft EIR for faculty-staff housing project</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495); jrburns@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1075964400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC to hold public...</display-name><path>/2004/02/450</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/02/450</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338023440</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338023440</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, will hold a public hearing on February 26 to receive comments on a draft Environmental Impact Report that has been prepared related to the campus's Ranch View Terrace faculty and staff housing project. The meeting will take place at UCSC's Barn Theater, located at the base of campus, from 6 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) examines the environmental effects of the project, which includes 80 three- and four-bedroom for-sale houses, 3 rental units, and a community center.</p>
<p>The project is planned for a portion of the 25.5 acres designated as "Inclusion Area D" in UCSC's Long Range Development Plan (LRDP). Inclusion Area D is located between UCSC's main entrance, Arboretum, and Farm. The project is proposed to be constructed on 13 acres in the northern portion of the inclusion area. The inclusion area's remaining acreage, situated between the housing development and High Street, will remain undeveloped.</p>
<p>The campus's LRDP, which provides a blueprint for campus growth, set aside several inclusion areas, including "D," to accommodate nonacademic, university-related activities such as faculty and staff housing.</p>
<p>UCSC has a critical need for faculty and staff housing on campus, said Frank Zwart, UCSC's associate vice chancellor for physical planning and construction, adding that UCSC expects to recruit 300 new faculty and replace 300 retiring faculty during the next 10 years. "The cost of regional housing is making it difficult to compete with other universities in attracting new employees," he said.</p>
<p>The draft EIR is available for review at UCSC's McHenry and Science &amp; Engineering Libraries and the main branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library. Paper copies may be purchased from Kinko's at 105 Laurel Street in Santa Cruz for the cost of duplication.</p>
<p>At the February 26 hearing, members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the draft EIR. Written comments may also be submitted during the comment period, which ends on March 10. Written comments should be sent to UCSC's Environmental Assessment Group (EAG), 515 Swift Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95060.</p>

The department is the new home for UCSC's renowned programs in bioinformatics, and includes faculty and researchers with interests in nanotechnology, protein engineering, and DNA microarrays (also known as "gene chips"). </p><p> The department's unique interdisciplinary blend of engineering, computer science, biology, and chemistry represents a powerful new approach to biomedical discovery, said David Deamer, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry and acting chair of the new department. </p><p> "We are the only department like this in the country. Our faculty are interested in biomolecules, genomics, nanotechnology, and biomedical applications, with a strong emphasis on computational approaches in their research," Deamer said. </p><p> The department's senior faculty include David Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and director of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, and Kevin Karplus, director of the engineering school's undergraduate and graduate programs in bioinformatics. Haussler and Karplus are both leaders in the field of bioinformatics, which applies computational techniques to complex problems in molecular biology. They transferred to the new department from computer science and computer engineering, respectively. Another bioinformatics expert, professor of computer engineering Richard Hughey, will also be affiliated with the new Department of Biomolecular Engineering as a consulting faculty member.</p><p> In addition to the bioinformatics programs, plans for the department include the establishment of new undergraduate and graduate degree programs in biomolecular engineering. Karplus emphasized that the department is not concerned with conventional "biomedical engineering," such as the development of prosthetic devices. Rather, biomolecular engineering refers to engineering "of, with, or for biological molecules," he said.</p><p> Examples include protein engineering (the computational design of proteins to enhance or modify their functions), the development of sensors that integrate biomolecules with electronic components, and new laboratory devices and analytical tools for studying gene regulation, protein expression, and other complex biological systems. </p><p> One project that illustrates several aspects of biomolecular engineering is the nanopore analytical instrument being developed by research scientist Mark Akeson with Deamer, Haussler, and their students. The nanopore instrument is built around a membrane containing a tiny hole just a few nanometers in diameter (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). An electrical field drives single molecules such as DNA through the nanopore. As a molecule enters the pore, it produces an electrical signal that provides information about its concentration, identity, and composition. The pore itself is a naturally occurring bacterial toxin made of self-assembling protein molecules. Potential applications of the nanopore device include ultrarapid DNA sequencing. </p><p> "Mark Akeson's research on nanopore analysis is a good example of the kind of research we are calling biomolecular engineering. It involves biomolecules and has clear biomedical applications; we are using computer algorithms to analyze the information we get from it; it has nanoscale elements; and, of course, it is engineering because we are developing a new technology," Deamer said.</p><p> Several new faculty members have been recruited in recent years to join the fledgling department. They include Assistant Professors Todd Lowe, Carol Rohl, and Joshua Stuart. Lowe, who won a prestigious Sloan Research Fellowship last year, uses DNA microarrays and combines computational and experimental approaches in his research on gene expression and comparative genomics.

Gallo, M.D., the scientist who 20 years ago codiscovered the HIV virus as the cause of AIDS, will deliver the fourth annual Sinsheimer Distinguished Lecture in Biology at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, March 4. The title of his talk is "HIV and AIDS in the 21st Century."</p>
<p>The lecture, which is free and open to the public, will begin at 4 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room at Colleges Nine and Ten on the UCSC campus. Free parking and shuttle service to the event will be available after 3:30 p.m. at the Barn Theater by the main campus entrance.</p>
<p>Gallo, founder and director of the Institute of Human Virology in Baltimore, will discuss some of the features that make HIV such a deadly virus, suggest ways that scientists can help poor countries hit hard by the AIDS epidemic, and outline the steps that could lead to a preventive vaccine.</p>
<p>Gallo was head of the National Cancer Institute's Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology in 1981 when the mysterious disease known as AIDS was first recognized. He has spent much of his career trying to put an end to the devastating AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>Though best known for his codiscovery of HIV, Gallo and his team also pioneered the development of the HIV blood test in the early 1980s, which enabled health care workers for the first time to screen for the AIDS virus, leading to a more rapid diagnosis while also protecting patients receiving blood transfusions. His research also helped physicians develop HIV therapies to prolong the lives of those infected with the virus.</p>
<p>Prior to the AIDS epidemic, Gallo was the first to identify a human retrovirus, the human leukemia virus (HTLV). In 1976, he and his colleagues discovered Interleukin-2, which is a growth-regulating substance now used as therapy in some cancers and sometimes for AIDS. And in 1986, he and his group discovered the first new human herpes virus in more than 25 years (HHV-6).</p>
<p>Today, Gallo's work continues at the Institute of Human Virology, which combines research, patient care, and prevention programs in a concerted effort to speed the pace of progress. The institute is a part of the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute and is affiliated with the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Enormous progress has been made in the past 20 years in basic studies of human retroviruses, including the elucidation of their replication cycles and most of the mechanisms by which they cause disease. According to Gallo, scientists probably now know as much about HIV as they do about any virus, and may know as much about AIDS as they do about any disease.</p>
<p>For some, HIV no longer produces a predictable death. Rather, with therapy, HIV infection is often a chronic disease with far less morbidity than in the past. Furthermore, pediatric AIDS has been almost eliminated in the industrial world. But the good news, Gallo says, is tempered by major challenges: the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV; the toxicity of drugs needed for years and probably for a patient's lifetime; the rise in cancer incidence in HIV-infected patients; the increasing epidemic in some populations in Western nations; the increasing numbers of people doubly infected with HIV and tuberculosis or hepatitis C, and their worse prognosis; the considerable uncertainty about the future of the epidemic; the lack of a preventive vaccine; and the dramatic epidemic in parts of the world that face enormous financial and infrastructure challenges.</p>
<p>Gallo's interest in science and medicine was first stirred by the loss of his 6-year-old sister to leukemia when he was a teen. The physicians who cared for her made a lasting impression, and Gallo would later make scientific research and the effort to put an end to deadly diseases his life's work.</p>
<p>Gallo's research has brought him international recognition as well as election into the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. He has been awarded honors for his contributions to science from countries around the world and holds 15 honorary doctorates. Gallo was the most referenced scientist in the world in the 1980s and 1990s, when he had the unique distinction of twice winning the prestigious Albert Lasker Award in Medicine (in 1982 and 1986). He is the author of more than 1,100 scientific publications and the book Virus Hunting - AIDS, Cancer &amp; the Human Retrovirus: A Story of Scientific Discovery.</p>
<p>The Sinsheimer Distinguished Lectureship in Biology is supported by an endowment from UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Emeritus Robert L. Sinsheimer and his wife, Karen. Robert Sinsheimer, who was chancellor from 1977 to 1987, is a renowned molecular biologist and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The lecture is hosted this year by UCSC's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and cosponsored by KUSP Radio.</p>

Greenwood was appointed provost and senior vice president of Academic Affairs, the second highest post in the UC system, during a special meeting of the Regents of the University of California today (Feb. 23, 2004).</p>
<p>Greenwood, who is an internationally recognized expert in genetics and nutrition and a national leader in science and higher education policy, has served as Chancellor of UC Santa Cruz since 1996. She will assume her new post on April 1.</p>
<p>"M.R.C. Greenwood possesses tremendous energy, academic accomplishment, and administrative skill. She brings the perfect credentials to this position," said UC President Robert C. Dynes, who submitted Greenwood's nomination to the Board of Regents. "UC Santa Cruz is a campus on the move - a campus making dramatic strides in countless areas - and M.R.C.'s leadership has had a great deal to do with that.</p>
<p>"Throughout the nation, public higher education is facing major challenges - the challenges of constrained state resources, increasing demand for services, and increasing expectations as our society looks to universities for answers to our most pressing problems. The University of California needs to be a leader in confronting the challenges and pursuing the opportunities of this new era. Because M.R.C. Greenwood is exactly the right person to join me and the rest of the UC system in this exciting endeavor, I made every effort to convince her to accept this position.</p>
<p>"She leaves UC Santa Cruz with a strong leadership team that, I am confident, will continue the momentum she has created."</p>
<p>Under Greenwood's leadership since 1996, UC Santa Cruz has increased the number of academic programs by 52 percent, from 63 to 96, including a 41 percent increase in graduate programs; created its first professional school, the Baskin School of Engineering; established two new residential colleges; more than doubled extramural research support; expanded total student enrollment by approximately 54 percent, with nearly 50 percent increase in graduate enrollment; hired 250 new faculty members; constructed nearly one million assignable square feet in academic buildings and housing, including 2,800 spaces in new student housing; acquired 50 acres of oceanfront property to expand research opportunities at Long Marine Laboratory; and raised more private donations than the previous total for the campus's entire history.</p>
<p>In October, Greenwood unveiled an historic UC/NASA partnership to create a world-class educational R&amp;D campus focusing on innovation and scientific discovery at the proposed NASA Research Park in the heart of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>"I dearly love the Santa Cruz campus, and I had not planned on leaving it so soon," said Greenwood. "But President Dynes is a very persuasive man, and he convinced me that I can better serve the University in this new role.</p>
<p>"The University of California delivers tremendous value to its students, and through its research, to the public at large," Greenwood added. "I am honored to be called on to help further work that is so critical for California."</p>
<p>An announcement regarding an acting chancellor for UC Santa Cruz will be made very soon. President Dynes also will launch as quickly as possible a national search for a permanent replacement for Greenwood and expects to have a new chancellor in place at UC Santa Cruz by no later than the beginning of the next academic year.</p>
<p>Greenwood, 60, replaces C. Judson King as provost of the UC system. King is retiring after eight years in the position and will become director of the UC Berkeley Center for Studies in Higher Education.</p>
<p>As provost, Greenwood will become the highest-ranking woman holding a systemwide post at the University of California and the first woman appointed to the position. She will oversee academic planning, research and academic policies for the 10-campus UC system. Other units under her supervision will include Continuing Education of the Bar, Education Abroad Program, Educational Outreach, UC Press, UC Extension, the California Policy Research Center and the Washington, D.C. Center.</p>
<p>After reviewing a group of about 60 exceptional candidates, a committee comprised of regents, chancellors and faculty advised Dynes in making his selection.</p>
<p>"On behalf of the faculty, I am delighted to welcome Chancellor Greenwood as the next Provost. The faculty advisors to the Search Committee had an outstanding pool of initial nominees and when Dr. Greenwood was sought out, she emerged as the most stellar," said Lawrence C. Pitts, Chair of the Academic Council and an advisory committee member. "We're fortunate that she's willing to bring her energy and ideas to the Office of the President, where I know that she will help President Dynes and the faculty move UC forward in these turbulent times."</p>
<p>Greenwood is a nationally recognized expert in a range of science and higher education policy issues, and she has testified at numerous Legislative hearings in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., on issues ranging from faculty gender equity to national security. She will be paid $380,000 a year. The salary falls between the averages paid to provosts of comparable public and private institutions.</p>
<p>Greenwood received her A.B., summa cum laude, from Vassar College in 1968, and received her Ph.D. from the Rockefeller University in 1973. She is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where she served as President in 1998 and Chair in 1999. She has delivered major policy addresses throughout California and in Washington, D.C., and internationally in London, New Delhi, Bangalore, and Seoul. She serves as a board member of leading national professional organizations and has been appointed to a variety of high-level positions advisory to state and federal government in the areas of science and higher education policy.</p>
<p>Before taking the reins at UC Santa Cruz, she served as Dean of Graduate Studies, Vice Provost for Academic Outreach and Professor of Biology and Internal Medicine at UC Davis. Prior to that, she taught at Vassar College, where she was Chair of the Department of Biology and Director of the Undergraduate Research Summer Institute. Previously, she was on the faculty of Columbia University's Medical School.</p>
<p>From November 1993 to May 1995, while on leave from UC Davis, Greenwood served as Associate Director for Science at the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Greenwood's immediate family includes her son Jim, a minister, who lives in Santa Rosa with his wife Michelle and their sons Davis and Dillon. Her granddaughter Seanne attends college in Idaho.</p>

<p>After years of discussion with a wide variety of artists, the UCSC music lecturer has come up with a multimedia concept--designed to visually enhance the solo guitar recital, and in the process, create a more audience-friendly format for the genre.</p>
<p>"I've been to many different concerts and festivals and in the traditional format, not much is happening onstage," Ã&#150;zgen explained. "It's dry and especially for non-musicians in the audience, it's very easy to lose focus after a while, no matter how great the playing is."</p>
<p>"We're also in a very visual age; we're constantly bombarded with thousands of visual images in movies and television," he added. "So my goal is to reach the widest possible audience for classical guitar--to make it accessible and more interesting. But I wanted to make sure it was done in an artful, subtle way--unlike the flashy visual effects of rock concerts."</p>
<p>The result is "New Dimensions in Classical Guitar,'' a multimedia concert featuring performances of innovative guitar works by Ã&#150;zgen--an award-winning guitarist, originally from Turkey--accompanied by video from assistant film and digital media professor Gustavo Vazquez; interactive computer images by music lecturer Peter Elsea; and innovative lighting design by assistant theater arts professor David Cuthbert.</p>
<p>The prototype for a planned international tour, "New Dimensions in Classical Guitar" will be unveiled on March 5 and 6 at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall as part of the 2003-04 UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures series.</p>
<p>The concerts will feature world premieres of a number of compositions written specifically for Ã&#150;zgen by such artists as internationally acclaimed guitarist Benjamin Verdery, Indian bansuri virtuoso Deepak Ram, UC Davis composition professor Pablo Ortiz, UCSC alumnus and lecturer Chris Pratorius, and former UCSC music lecturer Robert Strizich.</p>
<p>Verdery's piece will be performed on a guitar built especially for this composition, employing digital delay electronics and looping. "I'll also be playing it with paper clips and chopsticks," said Ã&#150;zgen.</p>
<p>The program will additionally feature the U.S. premiere of prominent British composer Anthony Gilbert's composition for recorder and guitar, which is based on a wood engraving titled Stars, by renowned artist M.C. Escher. Ã&#150;zgen noted that Elsea was working on computer animation for that piece from not only the final engraving, but also from Escher's analytical study sketches.</p>
<p>Vazquez has also attempted to link a video association with the origins of each piece of music he worked on. "This concert has offered me the opportunity to bring together my interests and training in painting, photography, and filmmaking," he observed.</p>
<p>Although the different UCSC faculty members bring their own individual artistic approaches to the music through visuals, Ã&#150;zgen stressed that the main objective of the project is to enhance and support the music--not to distract from it.</p>
<p>"Some pieces will just have special lighting, some will have a video emphasis with background lighting, and others will just use computer images supported by lights," he said. "But each composition will have very different types of video or computer images."</p>
<p>"I consider the lighting as connective tissue" Ã&#150;zgen added. "It supports the video and computer visuals--creating the atmosphere. David Cuthbert is crafting special colors to coincide with the videos and images to evoke the emotional mood of the pieces."</p>
<p>A champion of new music for guitar, Ã&#150;zgen has performed and taught master classes throughout the United States, Spain, and Turkey. He was the first guitarist to be awarded the "Dean's Prize," the highest honorary award of the Yale School of Music. Ã&#150;zgen has also performed as a featured soloist in the International Paco Pena Guitar Festival in Cordoba, Spain, and was a prizewinner in the International Portland Guitar Competition.</p>

The IODP will use multiple drilling platforms, including two new research vessels--a heavy "riser" vessel provided by Japan and a light drilling vessel sponsored by the United States. Delaney chaired the Conceptual Design Committee that provided recommendations for the U.S.-sponsored research vessel. Several other UCSC faculty have also been closely involved in the ODP and in planning for the new IODP. </p><p>"IODP will use the most advanced sampling and observing technologies available to investigate processes and regions of the Earth that were previously inaccessible and poorly understood," Delaney said. </p><p>Delaney's research involves analyzing the chemical composition of marine sediments to trace the chemical history of the oceans. She is especially interested in the nutrient history of the ocean, and her work has helped establish long-term records of phosphorus deposition in the seafloor. Her research also addresses how the chemical composition of calcite microfossils may change after deposition in the sediments, which is important because these fossils are a primary tool in deciphering the past composition of the ocean. </p><p>Delaney sailed on three ODP expeditions, contributed to several others, and chaired the program's Ocean History Panel for three years. From 1996 to 1999, she was editor of the scientific journal Paleoceanography, published by the AGU. The field of paleoceanography has proven to be of critical importance in understanding the history of Earth's biogeochemistry and climate and, by extension, the implications of global warming and other global changes for the future.</p><p>Delaney received her B.S. in chemistry from Yale University and her Ph.D. in oceanography from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She joined the UCSC faculty in 1983.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Delaney at (831) 459-4736 or delaney@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27ce7a68072704601a012ffbb2e0453"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626348930</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626348930</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27ce7a68072704601a012ffbb2e0453"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/02/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626348930</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626348930</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
