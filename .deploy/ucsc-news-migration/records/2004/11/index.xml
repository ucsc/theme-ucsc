Since 1976, the ARCS Foundation's Northern California Chapter has given more than $1 million in scholarships to UCSC students. This year, seven UCSC students each won $10,000 scholarships from the foundation. </p><p>The ARCS Foundation, founded in 1958, is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising students in science, medicine, and engineering. The foundation's Northern California Chapter is one of the leading private sources of annual student awards to the UCSC campus. </p><p>"The ARCS Foundation has provided incredible support over the years for the training of scientists and engineers," said David Kliger, dean of physical and biological sciences at UCSC. </p><p>The Northern California Chapter will honor the 2004-05 ARCS Scholars at its annual scholarship awards luncheon on Thursday, November 4, at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. The luncheon speaker and honored guest will be Nobel Laureate Arno Penzias. </p><p>This year's ARCS scholars at UCSC represent the Science Communication Program and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Computer Science, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Mathematics. The scholars and their interests are as follows:</p><p>. Vincent Bonini is a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. His thesis research addresses important aspects of the mathematical theory of classic and quantum relativity, with applications in physics and cosmology. </p><p>. Tonya Clayton has a background in geology and oceanography and is now enrolled in the Science Communication Program. She wants to be a science writer to help provide greater public access to scientific information and encourage informed decision making.</p><p>. Cynthia Hays is pursuing a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology. Her research on marine algae along the California coast aims to answer fundamental questions in ecology.</p><p>.	Jessica Marshall has a background in chemical engineering and is now enrolled in the Science Communication Program. She plans to work as a science writer to improve public understanding of science and its context in society.</p><p>.	Sarah Martell is pursuing a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics. She is using telescopes at the Lick and Keck Observatories to study very old stars in globular clusters, and she is developing software to analyze the spectroscopic data gathered by the telescopes. Her work will help scientists understand how stars evolve. </p><p>.	Jonathan Panttaja is a Ph.D. candidate in computer science. He is studying an important class of computationally intractable problems known as constraint-satisfaction problems. His work has broad applications in computer science and artificial intelligence.</p><p>.	Nicole Winter is pursuing a Ph.D. in chemistry. She does computational simulations of molecular dynamics to better understand the microscopic dynamics of chemical reactions in liquids. </p><p>The Northern California Chapter of the ARCS Foundation is one of 14 chapters nationwide. Since its founding in 1971, the chapter has raised over $10.4 million for 1,811 scholars attending seven northern California universities.

After the screening, Deanna Zachary, host of KUSP Radio's Talk of the Bay, will moderate a panel discussion on local and statewide coastal issues, including public access, property rights, coastal erosion, and coastal policy. </p><p>The sneak preview begins at 6:30 p.m on Thursday, November 11, at the Seymour Center. Seating is limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis. The event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Coastal Clash will be broadcast on Friday, November 12, at 9 p.m. on KQED Public Television Channel 9. For more information on coastal issues, educational materials, and repeat air dates, visit the KQED web site at <a href="http://www.kqed.org/coastalclash/">www.kqed.org/coastalclash</a>. Coastal Clash is a production of KQED Public Television in San Francisco.</p><p>Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and an expert on coastal geology, provided background information for the producers and is featured in the documentary. He will also take part in the panel discussion at the Seymour Center. </p><p>"Let's go to the beach" has always been an entitlement of California living, with 80 percent of Californians living within 30 miles of the water's edge. But as urbanization continues to encroach on the 1,100-mile-long coast, our shoreline has come under siege. Development is swallowing up miles of coastline; access to beaches is being cut off; and seawalls may be causing beaches to disappear. A battle is raging around the fundamental question: Whose coast is it, anyway?</p><p>Many Californians believe that the passage of the Coastal Act in 1976 and the subsequent creation of the California Coastal Commission and California Coastal Conservancy effectively saved the coastline. But despite the fact that California leads the nation in its protection and management of coastal resources, few locations in the United States rival California for its constant, intense pressure for development or for the politics that plague the operations of the California Coastal Commission.</p><p>Coastal Clash travels the California coastline and introduces representatives from all sides of the issue. Environmental experts, coastal scientists, government representatives, community leaders, and property owners reveal the state's history of tension between public and private coastal interests, examine the science of seawalls and their effect on beaches, and offer examples of both failed and successful attempts at coastal development.</p><p>Exploring the effects of seawalls, Coastal Clash visits the communities of Solana Beach and Pacifica. Beach access is examined in Malibu and Mendocino County, development in Santa Barbara County, and land trusts in San Luis Obispo County and the San Mateo Coast. </p><p>The Coastal Clash project draws upon KQED Public Broadcasting's multiple platforms to offer a public radio companion series, a content-rich web site, and extensive educational outreach.</p><p>For more information about the sneak preview, contact the Seymour Center at (831) 459-3800. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e35418072704601a012ffab1eb3a5"><name>587</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Monterey Institute of International Studies and UC Santa Cruz delay merger</title><author>UC Santa Cruz, Elizabeth M.

Baker and UC Santa Cruz Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers announced that severe limitations in state funding preclude incorporation of the Monterey Institute of International Studies into the University of California at this time. However, they reaffirmed through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) a shared intent to continue advancing feasible collaborations that will benefit students of the two institutions. Among other points, the MOU reflects interim steps for creating academic program affiliation and articulation agreements between the Monterey Institute and UC Santa Cruz.</p>

"There are several areas of distinction at the Monterey Institute that align favorably with programs at UC Santa Cruz," noted Chemers. "During the past months of serious analysis of the potential for a formal affiliation, a number of examples for mutual partnership have emerged, and we expect to pursue them to the extent possible, even without the additional funding that would be required for a full-scale merger." As one example, UCSC's strengths in international economics and leadership in research on social justice issues suggest opportunities to pursue with the Monterey Institute's Fisher Graduate School of International Business and the Graduate School of International Policy Studies. <br/>
<br/>
<p>Commenting on the MOU, Baker said, "The effort to bring the Monterey Institute and the University of California closer has underscored the many assets and positive contributions of each organization. Although I would welcome a chance to integrate our two institutions, the state's fiscal crisis makes that impossible at this time." With Chemers, Baker emphasized that the two institutions will continue to work together, stating, "Genuine opportunities remain to amplify the achievements of our individual campuses through a close working partnership, and we owe it to our students and to our society to make the most of these prospects."</p>
<p>The concept of possible incorporation of the Monterey Institute of International Studies into the University of California, with UC Santa Cruz as the lead campus, was first proposed in April 2003. Chester Haskell and M.R.C. Greenwood, at the time the Institute's president and the UC Santa Cruz chancellor respectively, launched an effort to explore the academic and financial feasibility of integrating the Monterey Institute into the University of California.</p>
<p>Situated on 5.2 acres in downtown Monterey, California, the Monterey Institute of International Studies comprises four separate graduate schools: translation and interpretation, language teaching, international business, and international public policy. These schools are augmented by three major research centers-the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, the Center for East Asian Studies, and the Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. Total enrollment at the Institute is approximately 700, with enrollment this past spring semester reaching the highest spring semester figure in its 49-year history.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz currently enrolls nearly 15,000 students, of whom approximately 1,500 are graduate students. It offers undergraduates a selection from among 61 majors, 31 minors, and 56 concentrations in the fields of Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences. UC Santa Cruz graduate study is available in 32 academic fields, with students enrolled at the certificate, master's, and doctoral levels.</p>

<p>"People have been working for years to solve environmental and social problems in the food system, and consumers have many more choices as a result of those efforts," said Allen, author of the new book Together at the Table: Sustainability and Sustenance in the American Agrifood System (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2004). "From the fields to the table, our food production and delivery system is being transformed."</p>
<p>Those pushing to make the food system more ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially just have a lot to boast about, said Allen, associate director for sustainable food systems at the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Among the highlights are:</p>
<p>. the growth of organic farming</p>
<p>. the popularity of farmers' markets</p>
<p>. the increase in community-supported agriculture, in which consumers invest in a farm for a share of its bounty</p>
<p>. the vitality of urban agriculture and community garden programs</p>
<p>. the proliferation of university research programs focused on sustainable food systems</p>
<p>. the introduction of farm-to-school programs that supply schools with fresh fruits and vegetables</p>
<p>As "alternative food movements" have gained momentum, they have helped transform institutions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the University of California. "Universities across the country have sustainable agriculture programs, and the USDA has programs that were unheard of 20 years ago," noted Allen, whose scholarship has challenged others to include human factors, as well as environmental conditions, in their definition of "sustainability."</p>
<p>While Allen celebrates the changes so far, she cautions that the "agrifood system" remains riddled with social inequities and contradictions. Issues that still need to be addressed include:</p>
<p>. working conditions for farmworkers and food processors</p>
<p>. gender, racial, and ethnic imbalance in the ownership of land and resources</p>
<p>. hunger and malnutrition caused by inequities in food distribution</p>
<p>"Now that the ideas of the alternative food movement are beginning to take hold, leaders can build on public interest to generate support for deeper changes," said Allen. "For example, would consumers support a 'socially just' label, like organic and fair-trade labels, that guaranteed things like health insurance and a living wage for farmworkers?"</p>
<p>Allen would also like to see university programs address socioeconomic issues, in addition to their current focus on farming practices. Similarly, K-12 programs could go beyond food delivery to teach children about the entire food system, including the processes of production and distribution, patterns of abundance and hunger, the role of advertising, how processed foods contribute to skyrocketing obesity rates, and, perhaps most importantly, the malleability of the food system.</p>

<p>"It's amazing how much the creative and committed people in the alternative agrifood movements have already accomplished," said Allen. "It's time to take stock and decide how to tackle the rest of the agenda."</p>

This major gift provides valuable support for the engineering school's Storage Systems Research Center. </p><p>"I am most excited that Mr. Malavalli, a business leader in the field of storage networks, has chosen to support the Storage Systems Research Center with this endowment," said dean of engineering Steve Kang. "The future success of the Baskin School of Engineering hinges on our close interactions with industry in Silicon Valley and with entrepreneurial leaders like Mr. Malavalli."</p><p>Kang announced the gift today at the dedication ceremonies for the new Engineering 2 Building on the UCSC campus.</p><p>Darrell Long, professor of computer science and director of the Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC), said that Malavalli's name adds an imprimatur to the SSRC that will help to attract further investments from companies and individuals.</p><p>"Kumar Malavalli is an immensely influential figure in the area of storage systems and has made great contributions to storage area networks. I am very pleased that someone who knows as much as he does about this field and about what's going on in the industry has decided to make such a generous contribution to our research," said Long, who is associate dean for research and graduate studies in the engineering school. </p><p>"This endowment will act as an anchor for the SSRC, giving us stability and allowing us to pursue new research ventures that are not funded under our current grants," Long said.</p><p>According to Malavalli, data storage technology has evolved into a mainstream technology that is now affecting all walks of life in modern society. </p><p>"All of the information that is generated in different areas of your life and in different businesses, it all has to be stored, moved around, replicated, and backed up. The technologies are growing by leaps and bounds, but we still don't have an optimal solution. More research is needed to fill the holes that exist today to provide the best solution for society," Malavalli said.</p><p>Malavalli was for many years the chief technical officer of Brocade Communications, the leading provider of storage area networking infrastructure, which he cofounded in 1995. He is also one of the principal architects of Fibre Channel technology, a high-speed data transfer technology used in storage networks. He served as chair of the ANSI T11 Technical Committee, which established universal standards for Fibre Channel. He has also served on the Boards of Directors of the Storage Networking Industry Association and the Fibre Channel Industry Association.</p><p>The SSRC, started five years ago, is regarded as an international leader in the field of storage systems research. In addition to Long, the center's faculty include Scott Brandt and Ethan Miller, both associate professors of computer science, as well as other faculty from the Departments of Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.</p><p>"We've been working together for years, and I feel we are one of the best groups in the world in this area of research," Long said.</p><p>The mission of the SSRC is to improve the performance and profitability of the data storage industry through a strong focus on the software and systems aspects of storage. Research in the SSRC focuses on caching, storage systems hierarchies, peta-scale storage systems, distributed storage systems, and security and performance. </p><p>The center works with a variety of industry partners that provide funding, equipment, and technical feedback for the center's research programs. Malavalli said he would like to help establish a more formal consortium of companies to work with the SSRC on cooperative research projects. </p><p>Malavalli earned degrees in electrical engineering and physics at the National Institute of Engineering in Mysore, India. He worked for ITT Communications, Amdahl, Canstar, and HP before arriving in Silicon Valley from Canada in 1995. He is currently CEO of InMage Systems.</p><p>In February 2003, Malavalli was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council Hall of Fame for his contributions to technology. He also received the Gene Milligan Award for Effective Committee Management from the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) for chairing an INCITS committee that developed 17 standards in the area of Storage Area Networks.</p><p>Malavalli currently invests in and mentors numerous storage networking startups in both Silicon Valley and in India. He also contributes substantially towards his own global vision, which encompasses telemedicine and education. He is a member of the Board of Directors of The Indus Entrepreneurs Silicon Valley Chapter, and is a trustee of the American India Foundation. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Darrell Long at (831) 459-2616 or darrell@cs.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e3b398072704601a012ff0e9b172e"><name>591</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scholarships Benefit Dinner raises $1 million to aid students</title><author>Elizabeth M.

<p>"This is a perfect launch to our 40th anniversary," said Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers, who co-hosted the Scholarships Benefit Dinner with UC Santa Cruz Foundation President Kenneth Feingold (Cowell College '71) and UCSC Alumni Association President Kenneth Doctor (Merrill '71). "We want to continue providing educational opportunities for all deserving students, regardless of their financial capacity," he commented. "In the face of rising costs, more support for our students is essential."</p>
<p>An increasing number of UC Santa Cruz students need financial assistance. In 2003-04, UC Santa Cruz provided financial support for nearly 8,000 of its undergraduates-up from 5,700 seven years ago.</p>
<p>The dinner convened more than 300 parents, alumni, donors, and other friends from throughout California. They heard how support changes students' lives from undergraduate scholarship recipient Mariel Tarango and Elena Nilsen, who recently received her Ph.D. in ocean sciences.</p>
<p>"I was able to finish my final year without delay, and pursue postdoctoral positions," Nilsen said. "As a result I was awarded a Mendenhall postdoctoral fellowship at the U.S. Geological Survey, where I continue to pursue the questions that drew me to science in the first place: impacts humans have on the coastal ocean."</p>
<p>Other speakers included Gary Novack, president of Pharmalogic and a UC Santa Cruz alumnus and Foundation trustee. He currently is serving as a UC Regent representing the all UC Alumni Associations. Alison Galloway, professor of Anthropology and the chair of the Academic Senate, noted the benefit she received from scholarships when she was a student. She also emphasized the importance of supporting talented students, whose work contributes to the academic excellence of the campus.</p>
<p>Several new scholarships and fellowships were announced at the dinner, including the History of Consciousness Fellowship Endowment; the Rebecca and Steve Sooy Graduate Fellowship in Marine Mammals; the Kathryn D. Sullivan Scholarship in Earth and Marine Sciences; the Eric Thomas Memorial Scholarship and the William Alfred Chavez Student Award, in honor of the late UCSC alumni and Foundation trustees Eric Thomas and William A. Chavez, respectively.</p>
<p>Also celebrated at the event were the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems Research at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering; the new fellowship in plant ecology and evolution established by Professor Emerita Jean Langenheim; and the Harry Beevers Endowment for the Arboretum student program.</p>
<p>A highlight of the dinner was the awarding of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal to M.R.C. Greenwood, now UC provost and senior vice president of academic affairs, who returned to the campus she led for nearly eight years.</p>
<p>The Foundation Medal recognizes people of exceptionally distinguished achievement whose work and contributions to society illustrate the ideals and vision of UC Santa Cruz. Designed and crafted by local sculptor and UC Santa Cruz alumnus Sean Monaghan, the medal's heart is a composite lens made from a remainder piece of the Keck Telescope's primary mirror, representing the far-reaching vision and constant striving for an innovative future at UC Santa Cruz. The base of the medal is granite quarried on campus, representing the solid University of California foundation for academic excellence.</p>
<p>Many supporters, including alumni, faculty, parents, and other friends, contributed to the success of the benefit dinner.</p>
<p>Among lead donors were Jean and Tim Weiss; Richard and Helen Spalding; Adobe Systems, Inc.; the Ram Bhojwani family; Richard and Alison Crowell, Kenneth and Moira Feingold; Anne and Paul Levin; M&amp;M Mars Company; Patricia and Rowland Rebele; Thomas and Patricia Vani; Barbara Canfield; the Santa Cruz Sentinel; Garry Spire and Ramyne Kahn; Martin M. Chemers and Barbara Goza Chemers; Margaret L. Delaney and John K. Mallory; and Kenneth and Katherine Doctor.</p>
<p>The campus raised a record $32.2 million in private support in the 2003-04 fiscal year and has ambitious plans to raise additional funds for student support. (See separate news release on the announcement of the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=592">Cornerstone Campaign</a>.)</p>

Suduiko and Foundation trustee and campaign chair Gordon Ringold made the announcement on November 6 before a crowd of more than 300 guests at the Scholarships Benefit Dinner at the University Center and College Nine/College Ten Dining Room. It is named the Cornerstone Campaign to suggest its role in building a solid base for ongoing fundraising success, they said.</p><p> "We set what seemed like an extremely ambitious goal when we commenced the silent phase of this campaign a little more than a year ago," stated Ringold, a UC Santa Cruz alumnus and chairman and CEO of Surromed, a pharmaceutical and biomedical technology company. "We challenged ourselves with a goal of raising $50 million over a two-year period, and, thanks to several exceptional examples of philanthropy, I am delighted to announce that we have already received $45 million. This accomplishment is a wonderful tribute to the extraordinary achievements of UCSC's faculty in teaching and research."</p><p>The campaign is a joint endeavor led by the campus's University Relations division in partnership with faculty, campus leaders, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, and the UCSC Alumni Association. A special focus of the campaign is underscored by its theme, "Support students. Transform lives."</p><p> </p><p>"We have an unprecedented opportunity to succeed in the Cornerstone Campaign, with students as special beneficiaries of the effort," noted Suduiko, who last year led the campus effort to raise a record-breaking $32.2 million, which is included in the campaign totals reached to date. Within the overall $50 million goal, the campaign is seeking to raise $5 million for student support, including scholarships, fellowships, and research grants. "We're going to reach our goal--and power right past it," Suduiko said.</p><p>A total of $2.4 million has already been raised toward that $5 million goal, including funds from the two successful Scholarships Benefit Dinners held in 2003 and 2004. </p><p>Among large gifts contributing to the total received to date is a $17.5 million award from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to support researchers affiliated with UCO/Lick Observatory, who are developing what will be the world's largest telescope. Other especially notable gifts include $6.5 million from Texas Instruments and $1 million to establish the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=590">Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems Research</a> at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering. The latter gift was announced at the dedication of the new engineering building on November 5. </p><p>Other gifts include $5.2 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for Ocean Sciences research, led by Professor Jonathan Zehr, and a $500,000 gift from Miller Outcalt to support the photography collection and special collections in the UCSC Library. Student support includes $200,000 from Professor Emerita Jean H. Langenheim for the Endowed Graduate Fellowship in Physical and Biological Sciences; an anonymous $200,000 to support graduate fellowships for the STEPS Institute; and $25,000 from Craig Schiffer for the History of Consciousness Fellowship Endowment.</p><p>This phase of the Cornerstone Campaign coincides with a year of celebration for the campus's 40th anniversary, which is being marked from fall 2004 through fall 2005.

The UCSC scientists have been using the new system's unprecedented computing power to run simulations of complex phenomena such as supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, and dark matter halos. </p><p>NASA will be featuring the work of UCSC researchers along with various NASA projects in demonstrations and presentations this week at SC2004, the premier international conference on high-performance computing, networking, and storage. The conference takes place at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh, November 6-12. </p><p>The Columbia supercomputer, named to honor the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia lost in early 2003, was unveiled at NASA Ames on October 26. It has achieved a sustained performance of 51.9 trillion operations per second, or teraflops, making it one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, outperforming Japan's Earth Simulator, previously the world's fastest supercomputer. (IBM's Blue Gene/L last week clocked 70.7 teraflops and now ranks first.)</p><p>Jim Taft, who leads the terascale applications group in NASA's Advanced Supercomputing Division, said access to Columbia was determined by a NASA review committee that established a list of prioritized activities.</p><p>"The UCSC work was at the top of the list, so we were authorized to give early access to a number of UCSC projects. These guys have been burning up the cycles ever since," Taft said.</p><p>The NASA exhibit at SC2004 will feature work by several UCSC researchers, including simulations of gamma-ray bursts and nuclear combustion in supernovae by Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and his collaborators. </p><p>"Using this machine is like being allowed to take several spins around the track at the wheel of the winning car at the Indy 500. We are ecstatic about the results we are getting," Woosley said. </p><p>In the supernova study, Woosley is working with postdoctoral researcher Mike Zingale and researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) to study in minute detail how a nuclear combustion front, or "flame," moves through a star as it explodes in a supernova. John Bell, Marc Day, and Chuck Rendleman are combustion scientists at LBNL who provided computer code for simulating flames that Zingale applied to the astrophysics of supernovae.</p><p>"It is novel having combustion scientists and astrophysicists working together this way, and it is an indication of the difficulty of the problem," Woosley said. "To our knowledge, this is the largest, highest resolution study ever done of nuclear combustion in a thermonuclear supernova."</p><p>Type Ia supernovae are the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe, as bright as ten billion suns, and they have become important as "standard candles" used to measure the size and expansion of the universe. The explosion begins as a few hot spots near the center of a white dwarf star, generating far more energy than convection or diffusion can dissipate. Carbon and oxygen fuse to form heavier elements, chiefly iron, and the temperature rises to ten billion degrees Kelvin. Since the ash is lighter than the surrounding fuel, bubbles form that float away, burning violently as they go. </p><p>Over the next second, most of the star is consumed, releasing enough energy to explode as a supernova. The properties of the explosion, including its brightness, are determined by the rate of nuclear fusion during that critical second, and a calculation based on "first principles" has eluded astrophysicists for decades because the flame is subject to a variety of instabilities that are tricky to model. The range of length scales is also enormous, from the one-millimeter thickness of the flame to the 2000 kilometer radius of the star.</p><p>Woosley's group is simulating floating bubbles bounded by a carbon fusion front propagating in an essentially infinite reservoir of fuel. Only a small piece of the entire supernova is carried in the calculation. These simulations are quite complex and only a massively parallel computer with a lot of memory is capable of doing the calculation. On Columbia, the researchers are able to run this simulation long enough to see the complexities in the evolution develop. This simulation has already grown so large that they would have been unable to carry it out on any other machine, Woosley said.</p><p>"The complexity of NASA's space-derived data have become so great that tools of this sort need to be developed to make sense of it all," Woosley said. "We expect numerical simulation will increasingly dominate theoretical astrophysics in the coming years. For better or worse, we have moved beyond the ability to solve the most important problems using pencil and paper alone."</p><p>Brandon Allgood, a graduate student working with UCSC professor of physics Joel Primack, is at the NASA exhibit at SC2004 this week to describe the dark matter simulation he has been running on Columbia. A video derived from the results of the simulation will be shown at the NASA exhibit.</p><p>"This simulation is being used to understand the formation histories and current shapes of the dark matter halos around galaxies," Allgood said. </p><p>Dark matter--mysterious particles that make up at least 90 percent of the universe--has shaped the evolution of the universe through its gravitational pull on the ordinary, observable matter of galaxies and stars. Galaxies formed within large halos of dark matter, and the clumping of dark matter also guided the formation of galaxy clusters and other large-scale structures in the universe. </p><p>Primack has been using dark matter simulations to model the evolution of structure in the universe for many years. His group's latest simulation completed its run in less than a week using just a fraction of Columbia's processing power. Primack said he had been unable to get enough time to run the simulation on a Department of Energy supercomputer, where it would have taken over a month to run the same code. </p><p>"We're very excited to have early access to this supercomputer. We are now running an even bigger and more ambitious project than the one that will be on display at the conference," Primack said. </p><p>Other UCSC projects running on the Columbia machines are led by Gary Glatzmaier, professor of Earth sciences, and Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics. Glatzmaier's group is studying complex processes in the deep interiors of stars, like the Sun, and large "gas giant" planets like Saturn. Madau and graduate student Michael Kuhlen are studying the early evolution of the universe with a simulation that follows the cosmological coevolution of dark matter and primordial gas. </p><p>Columbia is a highly integrated cluster of supercomputers driven by 10,240 Intel Itanium 2 processors.

Zavaleta, assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Previous experiments relied on random species removal rather than realistic patterns of loss, which turn out to be quite dissimilar.</p><p>	</p><p>"We replicated natural patterns and processes and found that both patterns of abundance and the order of species loss matter a great deal," said Zavaleta, who conducted the five-year study with Kristin B. Hulvey, a doctoral student in environmental studies at UCSC. "This defines a new direction for research."	</p><p>In the realistic loss scenario, entire groups of plants with unique functions disappeared faster than expected by chance, and invader resistance declined dramatically. The results suggest that biodiversity losses in natural systems can have far greater impacts than indicated by randomized-loss experiments. </p><p>	</p><p>The five-year study is among the first to combine conservation biology's focus on the order of species loss with experimental scrutiny of the consequences of those losses. It was conducted at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve at Stanford University. </p><p>After four years of observation to understand natural patterns of species loss, 70 research plots were planted with common annual grasses, rare summer-flowering forbs, and rare native bunch grasses. Plots reflected six levels of species diversity. Half of the plots were then invaded with Centaurea soltitialis L. (yellow starthistle), one of the most ecologically and economically damaging weeds in California.</p><p>"Then we watched how able the starthistle was to invade the various communities," said Zavaleta. "Starthistle was much less able to invade the more diverse communities."</p><p>In fact, from the most diverse to the least diverse plots, starthistle biomass increased by more than 100 percent. Even in plots where the total biomass of five rare species made up as little as 3 percent of the grassland, the extra diversity thwarted invaders, said Zavaleta. "Plots with 15 species had 75 percent more starthistle than plots with 20 species," she said.  </p><p>Each species, no matter how few in number, potentially provides different services within the ecosystem, explained Zavaleta. "Those extra species in our study are functionally unique. They are alive at different times of the year, and their roots are at different depths," she said. "It turns out that very rare things can matter a lot."</p><p>Other research has shown that more diverse communities use resources more efficiently, from water and nutrients to light, said Zavaleta. "By monopolizing resources, they're keeping invaders away," she added. "With fewer species, there are holes in the system and invaders can come in. Just a couple of members of certain species can help plug those holes. There may be only a few sprinkled around, but they can still be exerting a big effect on the way the system works.</p><p>Zavaleta likens the ecosystem benefits of retaining rare species to the role of a child plugging a dike with his thumb. "It's a small difference that can have huge consequences," she said. "Most ecologists would like to see natural systems able to do that--resist accidental invasion."</p><p>Underscoring the importance of the experiment's design, Zavaleta and Hulvey note that their findings differ from the results of studies at the same site that tested the effects of randomized changes in species richness on starthistle. That work found little difference in invader success depending on the number of species in each plot.  </p><p>"The incorporation of realistic species loss order into our experimental design profoundly altered the observed relation between diversity and invasibility," they write.</p><p>__________</p><p>Editor's Note: Erika Zavaleta may be reached at (831) 459-5011 or via e-mail at zavaleta@ucsc.edu. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e41388072704601a012ff30f1f417"><name>595</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>First major study of organic farming in California yields surprises</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1100502000000</start-date><display-name>First major study of...</display-name><path>/2004/11/595</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/11/595</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338078975</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338078975</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The first comprehensive study of organic agriculture in California challenges the popular notion that organic farming is dominated by small family-owned farms and shows how the industry's regulatory structure has thwarted the very benefits that have generated strong public support for organic agriculture.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Julie Guthman is available for media interviews; see contact information below.</font></b></td></tr></table>"Organic farming is seen as an answer to the crisis in our food system, but organic agriculture in California has evolved in some peculiar ways that effectively limit the number of acres that are in organic cultivation," said Julie Guthman, author of the new book, Agrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in California (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004).</p><p>In her analysis, Guthman, an assistant professor of community studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, also reconsiders "roads not taken" to a more socially just and ecologically sustainable agriculture.  </p><p>A strong proponent of many of the ideals associated with organic agriculture, Guthman nevertheless believes the fastest-growing segment of farming today warrants scrutiny. Many experts expect as much as 20 percent of California cropland will be in organic production by 2024.</p><p>Major misconceptions concern the "who and why" of organic farming and the impact of industry regulation. Among Guthman's findings:</p><p>. Contrary to the popular image of farmers who embraced a "live gently on the land" philosophy, many growers switched to higher-value organic commodities to increase earnings.</p><p>. Rather than corporate takeovers, much of the growth of organic agriculture has come from growers who made the switch from conventional farming to organic, met with success, and recruited other experienced conventional farmers to join them.</p><p>      </p><p>. Many growers went organic out of fear that the pesticides they relied on would be banned, while others were concerned about their personal exposure to pesticides or the risks associated with exposing others to pesticides.</p><p>"There were very compelling economic and regulatory reasons for conventional growers to enter into organics," said Guthman. "As they went organic, they brought along their technical competence, their marketing relationships, and their labor practices. As a result, organic farming in California today looks a lot more like the agribusiness model than the pastoral family-farm model most people think of." Today's tight price competition affects all organic growers, even those who would like to farm less intensively, she noted.</p><p>The second major force that shaped the organic industry--and ultimately limited its reach, argues Guthman--was the movement's decision to self-regulate through the establishment of independent organic standards and third-party certification programs to verify those standards. </p><p>        	Like the leaders of many social movements of the 1960s, the pioneers of organic agriculture had to decide whether to operate within the system or not. "They chose to use the market but not the state in developing organic's regulatory structure," said Guthman. "In establishing regulations for their industry, organic growers exhibited a certain self-interest and arbitrariness that created some perverse incentives and outcomes, albeit usually unintentionally."</p><p>For example:</p><p>. The focus on materials rather than processes--soil inputs rather than cover cropping, for example--fostered an idea that input substitution was good enough, allowing many growers to be organic without fundamentally altering their growing practices.</p><p>. Grower-designed and -enforced standards paved the way for the organic industry's failure to address social-justice aspects of sustainability, including farmworker wages and working conditions, and hunger and food distribution issues.</p><p>. Organic certification generates a price-premium that creates an incentive to restrict entry because reducing competition keeps the price-premium high.</p><p>  	"The paradox of incentive-based regulation is that it generates a motive to limit participation, when the whole purpose is supposed to encourage more sustainable production," said Guthman, noting that despite the growth of organic farming, it still accounts for only 1 percent of U.S. agricultural output.</p><p>Finally, Guthman paints an unromantic picture of agriculture in California. "Historically, small-scale family farms have never been the norm in California," she said. California's agrarian tradition has been shaped by land values that reflect and support a form of high-intensity, specialty-crop, year-round farming unlike anything else in the United States, said Guthman, who describes it as a "treadmill running on overdrive."</p><p>"Land values in California correlate to the value of crops that are grown and the intensification of farming practices, so farmers are under incredible pressure to get more crop value per acre," said Guthman. "Because organic adds value, it has the potential to further inflate land costs, which ironically undermines the goal of growing in less-intensive ways."</p><p>Guthman's prescription for addressing the shortcomings of the current system starts with "revisiting the roads less traveled," including banning pesticides, creating government subsidies for sustainable farming, eliminating subsidies for conventional agriculture, and revising immigration policies to support farmworkers. </p><p>"One percent of U.S. agricultural acreage is organic, compared to nearly 30 percent in Australia," said Guthman. "We have 2,000 organic farms in California, but Italy has 45,000. There's been much more widespread transformation in different political environments. We really have to ask ourselves how successful our approach has been."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to Journalists: Julie Guthman may be reached at (831) 459-2726 or via e-mail at jguthman@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e42e08072704601a012ffb7b17527"><name>596</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine biologist John Pearse to give Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UCSC on Tuesday, Nov. 23</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1100588400000</start-date><display-name>Marine biologist John Pearse...</display-name><path>/2004/11/596</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/11/596</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338079406</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338079406</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>John Pearse, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, will give the Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday, November 23.

<p>The endowment will be established in honor of the late Miller and Bunny Outcalt and their lifelong partnership in the field of photography. Proceeds will be used to fund a permanent staff position dedicated to work on the extensive photography archives housed at UCSC.</p>
<p>The University Library's Special Collections has built up an exceptionally strong body of work by many of the region's most distinguished photographers, including Edward Weston, Morley Baer, Pirkle Jones, and Al Weber. The UCSC collection is distinctive in its close ties to an active academic program, its simultaneous focus on preservation and access, and its location amidst a stunning natural landscape that inspired a generation of master photographers.</p>
<p>"Miller was a great admirer of nature photography of which the university has a large collection in its archives," noted Christine Bunting, head of Special Collections. "The gift is designed to create a new staff position to steward our unique collection that now numbers in the hundreds of thousands of prints and negatives-ranging from historic views of Santa Cruz to the landscapes of Edward Weston."</p>
<p>Miller and Bunny Outcalt established a multimillion dollar photo supply distributorship in southern California before retiring in 1983. They moved to Carmel in 1990 to devote themselves to photography as an art form--establishing the Photo Workshop Group of the Carmel Foundation and nurturing Miller's talents as an amateur photographer specializing in landscape and close-up abstracts. The couple focused on philanthropy, promoting the photographic arts throughout the major cultural institutions of the Monterey Bay Area.</p>
<p>"It's very unusual to endow a staff position at the university," noted Bunting. "It took someone like Miller who had both a love of photography and astute business sense to recognize the importance of supporting the organizational underpinning of the collections."</p>
<p>The new photo archivist position will help the library to process collections, inventory, catalog and index photographs, and prepare finding aids for the materials, as well as to appraise the physical condition of the collections and plan for preservation and conservation. The gift also ensures long-term accessibility for the public to enjoy the unique holdings at UCSC.</p>
<p>Miller passed away on November 16 and his wife, Bunny, died in January of 2003. As UCSC's McHenry Library is scheduled for a major renovation and expansion in the near future, there will soon be a new "Bunny &amp; Miller Outcalt Special Collections Reading Room" as a tribute and honor in recognition of their gift.</p>
<p>"We're really pleased to name our reading room after Miller and Bunny," said Bunting. "It's a wonderful place where the public can conduct research, view Special Collections material, and enjoy photographic exhibits."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e465d8072704601a012ff105905bd"><name>598</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Unusual material that contracts when heated is giving up its secrets to physicists</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1100761200000</start-date><display-name>Unusual material that contracts...</display-name><path>/2004/11/598</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/11/598</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338080298</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338080298</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Most solids expand when heated, a familiar phenomenon with many practical implications. Among the rare exceptions to this rule, the compound zirconium tungstate stands out by virtue of the enormous temperature range over which it exhibits so-called "negative thermal expansion," contracting as it heats up and expanding as it cools, and because it does so uniformly in all directions. </p><p>While engineers are already pursuing practical applications in areas ranging from electronics to dentistry, physicists have had a hard time explaining exactly what causes zirconium tungstate to behave in such a bizarre manner. Now, a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and other institutions has reported new insights into the atomic interactions underlying this phenomenon. A paper describing their findings will be posted online on November 22 and will appear in the November 26 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters. </p><p>"We have shown that a combination of geometrical frustration and unusual atomic motions are likely to be important to the negative thermal expansion in zirconium tungstate," said Zack Schlesinger, a professor of physics at UCSC. </p><p>Geometrical frustration sounds like something a high-school math student might feel, but is actually a rich area of research in physics and material science. In simple terms, geometrical frustration is like trying to tile a floor with pentagons--the shapes just won't fit together. In the case of zirconium tungstate, geometrical frustration comes into play during certain temperature-related vibrations of the compound's crystal lattice structure, the configuration of atomic bonds that holds the atoms together in a crystal.</p><p>The normal thermal expansion of solids results from changes in the atomic motions that make up these lattice vibrations. As heating adds more kinetic energy to the system, the lattice structure expands (in most solids) to accommodate the increasingly energetic atomic motions. </p><p>To study the atomic motions involved in lattice vibrations, physicists separate the vibrations into discrete "modes" or types of vibrations. In their investigation of zirconium tungstate, Schlesinger and his collaborators found evidence for a rotational ("twisting") mode that, due to geometrical frustration, occurs together with a translational ("back-and-forth") mode. This mixing of rotational and translational motion has the effect of pulling the overall structure together as heating puts more energy into the vibrations.</p><p>In other materials that show negative thermal expansion, the vibrational modes that pull the solid together create instabilities that eventually lead to rearrangements in the atomic structure. As a result, the negative thermal expansion only occurs over a narrow temperature range. In zirconium tungstate, however, geometrical frustration appears to block any such instability. </p><p>At least, that is the researchers' current thinking, Schlesinger said.</p><p>"To understand a complex system like this is not trivial. You have to break it down into all the different components of the atomic motions, and our work is making progress in that direction," he said. "It involves both mathematical analysis and experimental measurements, and ultimately you need to be able to visualize it." </p><p>The experiments themselves are relatively simple, he said. They involve shining infrared light on a sample of zirconium tungstate and measuring the reflectivity, which can be transformed mathematically into optical conductivity. These measurements reveal the frequencies of light that are absorbed by coupling with the lattice vibrations, and the researchers studied how these measurements changed with temperature.</p><p>Schlesinger said he initially gave the project to an undergraduate working in his lab, Chandra Turpen. When she began finding anomalous results, graduate student Jason Hancock used mathematical modeling to help figure out what the results meant.</p><p>"It started out as a senior thesis project that just became a lot more interesting as we went along," Schlesinger said.</p><p>In addition to Schlesinger, Turpen, and Hancock, who is the first author of the paper, the other coauthors are Glen Kowach of the City College of New York and Arthur Ramirez of Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, in New Jersey. </p><p>Schlesinger said the findings are interesting with respect to both pure physics and practical applications. On the pure physics side, they seem to provide a new and unusual example of geometrical frustration, which is most often studied in the realm of magnetism and disordered systems such as spin glasses. </p><p>"This material is not disordered--it is a perfect stoichiometric crystal--so we are seeing geometrical frustration manifested in a whole new system," Schlesinger said.</p><p>On the practical side, thermal expansion is a big problem in many different areas. In dentistry, most cracked fillings are the result of uneven expansion and contraction--the so-called "tea-to-ice-cream problem." And engineers working on everything from electronics to high-performance engines must cope with the effects of thermal expansion. A material that did not expand or contract with changing temperatures would have broad applications.</p><p>"If you could create the right mix of materials to neutralize thermal expansion, that would be quite a significant technological advance," Schlesinger said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Schlesinger at (831) 459-3714 or zack@physics.ucsc.edu.

<p>Los Huertos is also part of a growing global effort to address the problem of farm-generated nitrogen pollution. Just back from the Third International Nitrogen Conference in Nanjing, China, Los Huertos has a sobering message for farmers:</p>
<p>"China is ramping up agricultural production, and strong international environmental regulations could be what saves U.S. farming from a formidable competitor," said Los Huertos, who manages research for UCSC's Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).</p>
<p>"I saw hundreds of miles of greenhouses," Los Huertos said of a three-week tour of the Chinese countryside that followed the Nanjing conference. "Their fertility is terribly managed, but it's cheap. If they can figure out how to get their produce here fast enough, the Chinese could outcompete U.S. farmers in no time at all."</p>
<p>Convinced that U.S. farmers have a huge stake in regulations that would force global competitors to clean up their act, too, Los Huertos is eager to increase public understanding of agriculture-related nitrogen pollution.</p>
<p>"My job is to prepare farmers for policies that might affect them, whether at the state, federal, or international level, so I went to China to get a sense of the international movement," said Los Huertos.</p>
<p>Nitrogen accumulation reduces biodiversity, acidifies soil and water, degrades coastal environments, reduces forest productivity, contributes to the greenhouse effect, and depletes the ozone. "Reactive nitrogen is so high in the developed world that we're polluting ourselves out of clean air, drinking water, and biodiversity," he said.</p>
<p>Although essential to life, nitrogen must be converted from a gas to a reactive form to be usable by most organisms, including plants. The accumulation of reactive nitrogen in the environment is largely a result of the conversion of enormous quantities of nitrogen into fertilizers that are used in the production of food and fiber. Reactive nitrogen is also a by-product of fossil fuel combustion for transportation and energy production.</p>

<p>A significant portion of nitrogen in fertilizer is never taken up by plants and instead runs off, contributing to the "cascade" of atmospheric and aquatic nitrogen accumulating in many regions of the world--even as most of Africa and parts of South America and Asia suffer from a deficiency of reactive nitrogen in the soil.</p>

<p>In Nanjing, about 800 conference participants approved the "Nanjing Declaration on Nitrogen Management," which urges the United Nations Environment Program to promote understanding of the nitrogen cycle, assess consequences of its disturbance, provide policy advice and early-warning information, and promote international cooperation.</p>

<p>With CASFS Director Carol Shennan, a professor of environmental studies at UCSC, Los Huertos monitors nitrogen in several important waterways along the Central Coast, including the Pajaro River and around the Elkhorn Slough, one of the largest remaining tidal wetlands in California. Nitrogen levels in Central Coast agricultural watersheds have steadily increased since the 1950s, when levels of &lt;1 ppm were typical, according to state records compiled by Los Huertos. Today, Los Huertos regularly documents levels of 10 ppm in May and 20 ppm in the fall in the Pajaro River. Drinking water standards allow for a maximum of 10 ppm.</p>
<p>Unlike some coastal areas where fertilizer runoff has wiped out marine life, Monterey Bay circulates the ocean water and flushes nutrients through the ecosystem. This mixing and upwelling makes it difficult for scientists to assess how nitrogen runoff affects the bay, but it certainly has a role in the freshwater streams, according to Los Huertos.</p>
<p>"We know we have excess nitrogen on the Central Coast, and farmers and the state and federal government are struggling with finding ways to control polluted runoff," said Los Huertos.</p>
<p>In other coastal areas, runoff from nitrate-based fertilizers has had devastating consequences. In the Gulf of Mexico, a 5,000-square-mile area from the mouth of the Mississippi River almost to the Texas border is overrun with nitrates each summer, triggering an algae bloom that severely reduces oxygen levels until late September.</p>
<p>Researchers, including Los Huertos, have been working with government regulators to address the problem. The debate centers on whether to take a "carrot or stick" approach, observed Los Huertos.</p>
<p>California is considering a permit-like approach that would encourage farmers to take "short courses" to learn about nitrogen pollution, to adopt a water-quality protection plan, or to monitor their farm's discharge-or pay someone else to monitor it.</p>
<p>Los Huertos described two intriguing programs he learned about at the Nanjing conference. A program run by American Farmland Trust in the corn belt rewards farmers who reduce their use of fertilizer by allowing them to bank the financial savings with a guarantee that if their yields drop, they'll get their money back. No one has made a withdrawal, noted Los Huertos.</p>

<p>"Farmers are afraid to cut back on fertilizer because they're afraid their harvests will drop, but some of what they apply ends up in our waterways," he said. "This program gives farmers a low-risk incentive to cut back, and they're seeing that it's okay. They realize excess fertilizer hasn't benefited their crops. They might as well have been pouring that money down the drain."</p>

<p>A more punitive program run by the Nebraska Resource Conservation District fines farmers who overfertilize and contaminate wells to the point that the water becomes undrinkable.</p>

<p>"Farming is a ruthless business, and you have to be smart to make it," noted Los Huertos. "Margins are tight, and the risks are high, but the most successful growers are innovators. We have to find ways to ease the transition for growers who have become accustomed to using fertilizer in excess of crop needs. And we need to find ways to reduce the amount of nitrate that reaches sensitive habitats and sources of drinking water."</p>

The drug also dissolved existing fibrils in laboratory tests. </p><p>The researchers studied the effects of rifampicin in test tube experiments and are currently doing studies with cell cultures and mice to see if the same effects occur in living cells. Although these are just the first steps along the path toward clinical studies in humans, the findings suggest that rifampicin and related compounds might be effective in preventing fibril formation and associated neurological damage in patients with Parkinson's disease, said Anthony Fink, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC.</p><p>"Clearly, more work is needed to determine if this would work therapeutically, but if it does it would probably be most useful as a prophylactic therapy used in the early stages of the disease before there is general neurological damage," Fink said.</p><p>The research was carried out by a team of scientists in Fink's lab, including postdoctoral researchers Jie Li, Min Zhu, and Sudha Rajamani and research associate Vladimir Uversky. Li is first author of a paper describing their results in the November issue of the journal Chemistry and Biology, which is mailed and published online on November 29.</p><p>Aggregation of the protein known as alpha-synuclein into insoluble fibrils is thought to be a critical step in the development of Parkinson's disease, a progressive movement disorder resulting from the death of nerve cells in the brain that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. Deposits called Lewy bodies, composed mostly of alpha-synuclein fibrils, appear in affected nerve cells, but the connection between the fibrils and cell death remains controversial, Fink said.</p><p>"There are two schools of thought: One is that the fibrils themselves are toxic, and the other is that smaller precursors of the fibrils formed earlier in the process are toxic and cause the neurons to die," he said. </p><p>Fink's group found that rifampicin stabilized alpha-synuclein in a soluble form, both as single molecules and in small, soluble clumps of the protein, thereby preventing the formation of fibrils. Furthermore, addition of the drug to already-formed fibrils of alpha-synuclein resulted in disaggregation of the fibrils into soluble clumps and single molecules. Fink noted that preliminary data from experiments in cell cultures and in mice indicate that the soluble clumps of alpha-synuclein formed in the presence of rifampicin are nontoxic. </p><p>"The disaggregation of existing fibrils is probably the most interesting and novel finding in this study. If it works in people, that would really open up the possibility of stopping the progression of Parkinson's disease when it is first diagnosed," he said.</p><p>The researchers used several different techniques to study the mechanism underlying rifampicin's effects on alpha-synuclein. They found that the drug and its breakdown products bind tightly to alpha-synuclein, possibly even reacting with it to form a stable compound. </p><p>Their findings with rifampicin are very similar to previous research in Fink's lab with the compound baicalein, a flavonoid that also inhibits fibril formation and disaggregates existing fibrils of alpha-synuclein. Those results were published in June in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. </p><p>"We wanted to look at rifampicin because it is an already-approved drug that is similar to baicalein in key parts of its molecular structure," Fink said.</p><p>Research in other laboratories has found that rifampicin may also prevent the formation of the protein deposits that characterize Alzheimer's disease, which are composed of a different protein from alpha-synuclein. In addition, epidemiological studies of leprosy patients have indicated that patients treated for several years with rifampicin had a lower probability of developing senile dementia. </p><p>"Dementia is associated with Alzheimer's disease and with about one third of patients with Parkinson's disease. But no studies have looked specifically at Parkinson's disease in people taking this drug," Fink said.</p><p>Fink's research on alpha-synuclein is supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Fink at (831) 459-2744 or enzyme@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e4b578072704601a012ffc99cf248"><name>601</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer analysis shows scientists could reconstruct the genome of the common ancestor of all placental mammals</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1101798000000</start-date><display-name>Computer analysis shows scientists...</display-name><path>/2004/11/601</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/11/601</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338081553</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338081553</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Contrary to the movie Jurassic Park, in which scientists recreate dinosaurs from ancient DNA, genetic material more than about 50 thousand years old cannot be reliably recovered. Nevertheless, a team of scientists has now demonstrated that computers could be used to reconstruct with 98 percent accuracy the DNA of a creature that lived at the time of the dinosaurs more than 75 million years ago--a small, furry nocturnal animal that was the common ancestor of most placental mammals, including humans. </p><p>Knowing this ancestral mammal's complete genome--the sequence of As, Cs, Ts, and Gs in the DNA that made up its chromosomes--would not mean that scientists could bring it to life. (For one thing, synthesizing that much DNA would be prohibitively expensive and technically difficult.) </p><p>But that's not the point. The point is to understand the evolution of humans and other mammals at the molecular level, said David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>"We will be able to trace the molecular evolution of our genome over the past 75 million years. It's a very exciting new way to think about our origins, a kind of DNA-based archaeology to understand how we came to be," said Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator and director of UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering. </p><p>Haussler and Mathieu Blanchette, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC who is now at McGill University, teamed up with Eric Green, scientific director at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and director of the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center, and Webb Miller, professor of biology and computer science and engineering at Pennsylvania State University, to look at the possibility of reconstructing the ancestral mammalian genome. A paper describing their findings appears in the December issue of the journal Genome Research. </p><p>The study is an extension of ongoing research in comparative genomics--the effort to understand the human genome by comparing it with the genomes of other species. By comparing the human genome to the ancestral genome, scientists may learn much more than they can from comparisons with other living species, such as the mouse, rat, and chimpanzee, Haussler said. </p><p>"If we find a DNA sequence in the human genome that is missing in the corresponding place in the mouse genome, we can't tell whether that DNA was inserted in the evolution of humans from the mammalian ancestor or deleted in the evolution of mice," he said. "If the ancestral genome is available, this ambiguity disappears."</p><p>The researchers developed a computational procedure for reconstructing ancestral genome sequences that was based primarily on Miller's widely used genome comparison software, together with an assortment of new computer algorithms devised for this project. To test the reconstruction process, they created an artificial set of mammalian genome sequences for which the ancestral sequence was known.</p><p>Blanchette, who is the first author of the paper, generated this artificial evolutionary tree by creating a massive software program to simulate all the known processes that modify DNA as it evolves. The program was based on a huge amount of data from Green's research at NHGRI, where scientists are doing comparative analyses of genomic sequences from many different vertebrate species. In particular, the researchers focused on a region called the CFTR locus, which includes the gene involved in cystic fibrosis. This region--encompassing ten genes and adjacent stretches of DNA, for a total of more than one million base pairs or "letters" of genetic code--had been completely sequenced in many different mammals. </p><p>"This region served as an example of the evolutionary changes that happened in all these different mammalian lineages. [Blanchette] took all of the information we learned from detailed examination of this one region and incorporated it into a software program that is able to simulate mammalian evolution at the molecular level," Haussler said. </p><p>The researchers applied the software to a hypothetical ancestral DNA sequence, artificially evolving the DNA along all the various pathways of mammalian evolution to create simulated modern DNA sequences for 20 different species. Then they used their reconstruction procedure (a completely separate process that incorporates no information from the simulation process) to recreate the ancestral sequence. Comparing the reconstructed sequence with the original ancestral sequence, they found that it was 98 percent accurate. </p><p>The next step was to apply the reconstruction process to the actual genomic sequences for the CFTR locus in the 19 mammalian species for which this DNA sequence was available, including humans. The researchers evaluated the accuracy of this reconstruction by comparing it to species not included in the group from which it was derived, such as chickens and opossums. These comparisons suggested an accuracy of more than 99 percent in the places they could test, including the cystic fibrosis gene itself.</p><p>"Overall, we think that we can reconstruct the DNA sequences of the ancestral genome with an accuracy of more than 98 percent," Haussler said. "That is much higher accuracy than people expected would be possible."</p><p>Haussler said he hopes these findings will encourage the additional genome sequencing that would be needed to do a complete reconstruction of the ancestral mammalian genome. Living mammals, from apes to bats to whales, are all variations on a common mammalian theme. Comparisons with their common ancestor can reveal new insights into not only the core biology that all mammals share in common, but also the unique traits that define each species, he said.</p><p>Nearly complete genome sequences are available now for five mammals, and about 20 would be needed for an accurate reconstruction.

Joseph Lowery, who helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Martin Luther King in 1957 and led the organization for 20 years, will be the keynote speaker at UCSC's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on January 10.</p>
<p>Lowery will speak at 7 p.m. in the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Lowery played a major role in many of the pivotal civil rights struggles of the 1950s and '60s and has remained active.</p>
<p>In a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court, Lowery was among four ministers sued by Alabama officials for $3 million in the early 1950s. Lowery's property was seized, but he was vindicated when the court ruled for the ministers in the landmark 1964 libel case, Sullivan v. New York Times, Abernathy, Lowery, Shuttlesworth, and Seay.</p>
<p>In 1965, King named Lowery to deliver the demands of a planned Selma-to-Montgomery march for voting rights to then-Alabama Governor George Wallace. In an event that shocked the nation, police tear-gassed and clubbed the peaceful marchers at Edmund Pettus Bridge. The brutality of what came to be known as "Bloody Sunday" focused the nation's attention on the extreme measures used to prevent black citizens from exercising their constitutional right to vote, leading Congress to enact the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
<p>Lowery recalled the 1965 march when he testified before a U.S. Senate committee following the disputed 2000 presidential election. "Dr. King could not have anticipated that once we secured the ballot in 1965, that here in 2001, we would be demanding that our government assure us that our votes are fairly and accurately counted," Lowery told the senators. "We must understand that failure to provide those resources is to blaspheme our devotion to rights guaranteed in the Constitution of these United States."</p>
<p>As president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference from 1977 to 1997, Lowery protested apartheid policies in South Africa and cochaired the 1990 Nelson Mandela visit to Atlanta following Mandela's release from prison. He led a peace delegation to the Middle East and met with the president of Lebanon and Yasser Arafat to seek justice in the Middle East by nonviolent means. Lowery also led protests and was arrested twice in a campaign against the dumping of toxic waste in Warren County, N.C.</p>
<p>Lowery also cofounded the Black Leadership Forum, a consortium of national black advocacy organizations, and served as third president following Vernon Jordan and Benjamin Hooks.</p>
<p>After retiring from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1998, Lowery helped African American farmers secure a federal court decree valued at $2 billion against the Department of Agriculture for discrimination.</p>
<p>In 2001, Clark Atlanta University established the Joseph E. Lowery Institute for Justice &amp; Human Rights to provide an opportunity for students, teachers, elected officials and others "to benefit from examples of nonviolent advocacy, and exploration of the moral, ethical and theological imperatives for justice and human rights for all people."</p>
<p>In 2003, Lowery received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, one of many such awards from universities around the nation. The Atlanta Board of Education has instituted the Joseph E. Lowery Lecture Series on Civic Participation, and the Atlanta City Council voted to change the name of Ashby Street to Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard.</p>
<p>This fall, Lowery was among the first group of honorees included in the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic site in Atlanta. Others honored included former President Jimmy Carter, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>In addition to UCSC, the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation is cosponsored by the City of Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Sentinel, KUSP Radio, Inner Light Ministries, and the Santa Cruz Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP.</p>

Anshen + Allen Los Angeles was the architect for Engineering 2, which was dedicated on November 5. Engineering 2 includes 150,000 square feet of new office, laboratory, and classroom space on the UC Santa Cruz campus, primarily for the Baskin School of Engineering. The project also includes a 212-seat auditorium and a large open plaza that provides an inviting outdoor space between the Baskin Engineering Building and Engineering 2.</p><p>The award jury praised the use of different materials to heighten the scale change of the different functions in Engineering 2. Jurors included architects Toshiko Mori, dean at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard; Jim Jennings of San Francisco; and Dan Hanganu of Montreal.</p><p>"Engineering 2 is already recognized as a striking addition to the Santa Cruz campus, but its handsome appearance is only part of the story," said Frank Zwart, campus architect and associate vice chancellor for physical planning and construction. "It moved from initial design to occupancy in just over three years, a feat probably unmatched in the history of construction at UCSC. Its greatly accelerated schedule challenged everyone involved in the project: the architects and their engineering consultants, the contractors and subcontractors, the university's project development staff, and the School of Engineering's faculty and users." </p><p>Zwart added, "Anshen + Allen's ability to meet a series of unforgiving deadlines and to produce an award-winning project simultaneously is an especially noteworthy accomplishment."</p><p>Winning projects in the competition represent "the cutting edge in contemporary architecture, interior design and historic restoration, selected by a distinguished jury of local and internationally known architects," according to the American Institute of Architects. </p><p>_____</p><p>Additional information about the American Institute of Architects Los Angeles chapter is available at <a href="http://www.aialosangeles.org">www.aialosangeles.org</a>; the Anshen + Ashen web site is <a href="http://www.anshen.com/">www.anshen.com/</a>.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/">www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e59908072704601a012ffc291fc80"><name>611</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine biologist John Pearse to give Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UCSC on Tuesday, Nov. 23</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1100588400000</start-date><display-name>Marine biologist John Pearse...</display-name><path>/2004/11/611</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/11/611</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338085199</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338085199</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>John Pearse, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, will give the Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Tuesday, November 23.

This event is free and open to the public.</p><p>Pearse is one of the world's leading experts on marine invertebrates and intertidal ecology. His research includes investigations of the reproductive ecology of sea urchins and other marine animals, as well as long-term monitoring of intertidal life on the shores of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. </p><p>In his lecture, presented by the UCSC Emeriti Faculty Association, Pearse will talk about how animals that live on the bottoms of polar seas reproduce. Pearse, who has done research on this subject himself, said that scientists' ideas about the biology of marine animals in cold waters have undergone major shifts over the course of the past 100 years. In his talk, Pearse will give an overview of these ideas and how they have changed as scientists learned more about marine life in harsh polar environments. </p><p>Pearse has received numerous awards and honors during his career, including several teaching awards from UCSC and the American University of Cairo, Egypt, where he taught before coming to UCSC in 1971. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and has served as president of several scientific organizations, including the California Academy of Sciences, the Western Society of Naturalists, and the International Society of Invertebrate Reproduction. He is currently president-elect of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. </p><p>The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary has honored Pearse several times, most recently as the 2004 Ricketts Memorial Lecturer. He received the sanctuary's annual recognition award twice, for science in 1994 and for education in 2003. </p><p>The Emeriti Faculty Lecture is sponsored by the Office of the Chancellor.

The black-headed duck of South America is one of these, but it stands out from all the others in a striking way. Black-headed ducks don't need any parental care other than incubation for their eggs--the ducklings leave the nest one day after hatching and paddle off into the reeds to fend for themselves. </p><p>"There doesn't seem to be much if any cost to the host species, so you wouldn't expect there to be much pressure on the hosts to evolve defenses against this kind of parasitism," said Bruce Lyon, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>When Lyon and John Eadie of UC Davis set out to study the black-headed ducks, they expected to find a highly successful brood parasite, unopposed by the antagonistic strategies that host species deploy against more costly parasites like cuckoos and cowbirds. Instead, they found that black-headed duck eggs are often rejected from host nests, and it took four years of detailed field research to figure out why. Lyon and Eadie published their findings in the November 18 issue of the journal Nature.</p><p>The key breakthrough was their discovery that each of the black-headed duck's two main host species--the red-gartered coot and red-fronted coot--were busy parasitizing the nests of their own species. The black-headed ducks were being thwarted by defenses that had evolved as a result of brood parasitism among the coots themselves. </p><p>The researchers carefully investigated the costs of duck parasitism to the hosts and found few costs that could be prevented by rejection of the duck eggs. In contrast, the intraspecific (within the same species) brood parasitism taking place among the coots is very costly to the hosts because they end up feeding and raising the young of other birds at the expense of their own young.</p><p>Intraspecific brood parasitism in the coots also helped explain a puzzling feature of the parasitic duck eggs. Other obligate brood parasites lay eggs that mimic the eggs of their hosts, but the eggs of black-headed ducks don't look anything like coot eggs. A black-headed duck's big white egg stands out like a sore thumb in a nest full of speckled brown coot eggs. </p><p>Apparently, the ducks have been unable to gradually evolve egg mimicry because their hosts are already attuned to detecting eggs laid by other birds of their own species, Lyon said. Mimicry would clearly be an advantage, because parasitic eggs of other coots are not rejected as often as duck eggs. But the black-headed duck eggs differ from coot eggs in so many fundamental ways that any incremental change in egg size or coloration would not yield an advantage for the ducks and would not be favored by natural selection.</p><p>The researchers confirmed this idea experimentally by adding painted eggs to coot nests. They found that improving the degree of mimicry had no effect on the likelihood of egg rejection. </p><p>"They're just stuck, without much wiggle room for improving their success. There's no way for gradual evolution to bring them into the zone of egg mimicry," Lyon said.</p><p>With different hosts, the black-headed duck's kinder, gentler version of brood parasitism might have been a highly successful evolutionary strategy. Instead, the species finds itself evolutionarily stranded, caught in the cross-fire of an internecine conflict among its hosts.</p><p>"The adaptations that have arisen in coots to deal with the high costs of intraspecific brood parasitism have, in effect, inoculated this system against further coevolutionary adaptations on the part of the parasitic duck," Eadie said.</p><p>Interestingly, Lyon and Eadie's findings in South America are very similar to the results of an experiment conducted 30 years ago by ecologist Milton Weller with American coots in Iowa. American coots engage in brood parasitism within their own species, but are not parasitized by other species. When white chicken eggs were added to their nests, they rejected some but not all of them, much like the response of the two South American coot species to black-headed duck eggs. This supports the idea that rejection of the black-headed duck eggs is an incidental by-product of the intense reproductive battles going on within the host species.</p><p>But this raises another question: If the duck eggs are so obvious, why aren't they all rejected by the coots? In fact, Lyon and Eadie observed that egg rejection rates rose to 100 percent during flooding or high waves in the wetlands, when the coots were frantically trying to build up their nests. Both species of coots appear to be able to recognize and reject duck eggs when they need to, but apparently do not always do so. </p><p>"It's still a mystery why the coots don't reject all of the duck eggs. We need to know more about the cognitive processes involved in egg recognition and rejection by the coots," Lyon said.</p><p>Lyon has conducted extensive research on intraspecific brood parasitism in American coots. He has found, for example, that an ability to "count" the eggs in their nests plays an important role in their rejection of parasitic eggs of their own species. Despite his familiarity with American coots and their parasitic habits, however, Lyon said it was not obvious that the same thing was happening in the two South American species. "Of all people, I should have been able to see this," he said.</p><p>But intraspecific brood parasitism is notoriously difficult to detect. Lyon and Eadie conducted a large-scale study of the black-headed duck involving several different wetlands in Argentina, observations of almost 2,000 potential host nests, and several different experiments that involved manipulating the contents of nests. It was only in the fourth and final year of the study that the importance of intraspecific brood parasitism became apparent.</p><p>"For some reason it was really prevalent and noticeable that year, and finally we had an explanation for the anomalous results we had been finding," Lyon said.</p><p>Relatively little was known about the black-headed duck before this study, aside from a single-year study conducted by Weller over three decades ago. It had been thought that they exploited a wide range of host species, but Lyon and Eadie found that the ducks focused their parasitic efforts on the two species of coots, only occasionally laying eggs in the nests of other species. Thus, black-headed ducks appear to be specialist brood parasites, relying on the two coots to eke out a living, Eadie said. </p><p>Obligate brood parasitism has evolved separately in five different families of birds. The "obligate" part of the phrase means they have no other option--they never build nests or raise their own young, so they are obligated to parasitize others. The black-headed duck, with its precocial young and lack of egg mimicry, is a real oddball in this group.</p><p>Although he can only speculate about why brood parasitism arose in the black-headed duck in the first place, Lyon said one possibility is that the coot hosts offer good protection of eggs from predators.</p><p>"Coots are pretty pugnacious, and their nests don't suffer a high predation rate, so the ducks may have higher success through parasitism despite the frequency of egg rejection," he said.</p><p>As for predation of the day-old ducklings after they leave the host nest, Lyon said they must be good at hiding because there are a lot of predators in their wetland habitat.</p><p>"We never see them after they leave the nests. We'd like to put radio transmitters on them to find out where they go," he said.</p><p>The black-headed duck may be in a precarious situation considering that adverse environmental conditions, such as flooding or high waves, can lead to increased egg rejection by their hosts. If environmental change, such as global warming, causes more frequent flooding of the wetlands, the ducks could be in trouble, Lyon said.</p><p>Lyon and Eadie's research was funded in part by the National Geographic Society and the British Broadcasting Company.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Lyon at (831) 459-3949 or lyon@biology.ucsc.edu, and Eadie at (530) 754-9204 or jmeadie@ucdavis.edu</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27e452b8072704601a012ff385dd90e"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626438406</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626438406</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27e452b8072704601a012ff385dd90e"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626438406</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626438406</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
