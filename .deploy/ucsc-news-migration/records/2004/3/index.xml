Dynes has appointed Martin M. Chemers acting chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, pending approval of the University of California Board of Regents.</p>
<p>The Regents will vote on Chemers's appointment at their March 18 meeting. The appointment is effective April 1, the same day UCSC Chancellor <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=455">M.R.C. Greenwood will assume her new role</a> as provost and senior vice president of the UC system.</p>
<p>A national search will be conducted to select UCSC's next chancellor, with a permanent appointment expected later this year.</p>
<p>"I was looking for another vital leader for UC Santa Cruz, and Martin Chemers fits perfectly," Dynes said of his interim appointee, who is currently UCSC's provost and executive vice chancellor. "He has a keen understanding of the aspirations and priorities of the campus, and he enjoys very effective relationships with the campus community. Along with extensive administrative experience and a stellar academic reputation, these attributes made him the best choice for this position."</p>
<p>"This is both a wonderful honor and a welcome responsibility," Chemers said of his appointment as acting chancellor. "I approach this job with great optimism for what we can accomplish together.</p>
<p>"The coming months present significant challenges for UC Santa Cruz," Chemers added. "We'll continue our process to grapple with the budget crisis in a way that will position us to seize opportunities when the economy turns around; we'll advance 'Planning for 2020,' the long-range development plan process; and we'll continue to celebrate the achievements of our exceptional faculty and benefit from our generous supporters. We have to make every day count, as we continue--and even accelerate--our momentum."</p>
<p>Chemers, 60, plans to quickly establish the team that will assist him with academic and budgetary issues. "I feel fortunate to have available experienced individuals who can take on additional responsibilities during this important period," he said.</p>
<p>Chemers arrived at UC Santa Cruz in 1995 as dean of social sciences and professor of psychology. During his tenure as dean, the College Nine and College Ten complex was completed, and with Chemers's leadership, was organized to integrate the themes of the colleges with the academic strengths of the Social Sciences Division.</p>
<p>Chemers also initiated the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, supported the development of the Center for Global, International and Regional Studies, and oversaw the creation of 17 new academic programs, including the Ph.D. in education, several multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary programs, such as the STEPS Institute, and business management economics, the fastest-growing undergraduate major on campus.</p>
<p>"I am delighted with this choice," noted Greenwood. "In his recent visit, President Dynes made special note of the talented senior leadership at UC Santa Cruz, and Martin Chemers is exemplary of that strength."</p>
<p>Prior to coming to Santa Cruz, Chemers was Henry R. Kravis Professor of Leadership and Organizational Psychology and director of the Kravis Leadership Institute at Claremont McKenna College. Previous to his appointment at Claremont, he was professor and chairman of the Department of Psychology at the University of Utah, from 1970 to 1987. He also has held academic positions at the University of Delaware.</p>
<p>Anthropology professor and chair of the Santa Cruz Division of the UC Academic Senate, Alison Galloway commented: "This is very much a relief to the campus. We have been impressed by his ability to move rapidly into the responsibilities of the executive vice chancellor and look forward to him assuming the role of chancellor. He has a well-earned reputation for being open, balanced, and decisive--just what we need in these difficult times."</p>
<p>Chemers has earned an international reputation for his research and teaching in organizational psychology. He is widely regarded among social psychologists as one of the foremost scholars on cross-cultural and social psychological aspects of leadership. He has published numerous books and articles in prestigious journals on subjects that include leadership effectiveness and organizational development. His latest book is <em>An Integrative Theory of Leadership,</em> published in 1997 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Psychological Association, a fellow of the American Psychological Society, and president-elect of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology, Chemers received his B.S. (Honors) in 1964, his M.S. in 1966, and his Ph.D. in 1968, all from the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>A native of Chicago, Chemers is married to Barbara Goza Chemers. He has two sons and two grandsons. One son, Michael, is married to the former Farhana Basha; the other son, Holden, is a 1995 UCSC graduate, married to the former Misa Klyce, also a UCSC alumna.</p>
<p>As acting chancellor, Chemers will be paid $269,200 a year, the same salary Greenwood is earning as chancellor.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has a current enrollment of nearly 15,000 students, a total teaching and research faculty and staff of approximately 5,000, and a local economic impact exceeding $1 billion. In addition to the campus facilities on 2,000 acres overlooking Monterey Bay, UC Santa Cruz also operates the Long Marine Laboratory, UCO/Lick Observatory, Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology Center in Monterey County, and, in partnership with NASA Ames at Moffett Field, a University Affiliated Research Center, the first of its kind in the nation.</p>

Little is known about how it survives and adapts to changes in its aquatic habitat, but one factor is the cholera bacteria's ability to switch from a free-floating "planktonic" mode to the formation of slimy bacterial "biofilms" on various surfaces. </p><p>"Biofilms are thought to be a refuge for the organism, where it is better able to survive stressful conditions," said Fitnat Yildiz, an assistant professor of environmental toxicology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>Yildiz's lab is investigating the molecular mechanisms that enable cholera bacteria to switch between the two growth modes. She and postdoctoral researcher Catharina Casper-Lindley reported their latest findings in a paper featured on the cover of the March issue of the Journal of Bacteriology. </p><p>The researchers have identified a new regulatory gene required for the production of a mucus-like substance--an "exopolysaccharide"--that is involved in biofilm formation. The exopolysaccharide attaches the bacteria in a biofilm to each other and to surfaces.</p><p>"It is basically goop that the cells excrete and that forms the matrix of the biofilm," Casper-Lindley said. </p><p>The newly discovered gene is the second such regulator of biofilm formation found in cholera bacteria. Yildiz discovered the other regulatory gene in previous work done at Stanford University. The findings suggest that biofilm formation is controlled by a complex regulatory network of molecular signals. </p><p> </p><p>"We are now trying to understand the entire pathway--the interplay between the regulators and other signaling molecules that enables the bacteria to sense and respond to environmental conditions," Yildiz said.</p><p>In the laboratory, the two growth modes of V. cholerae correspond to distinctive colony morphologies when the bacteria are grown on a solid agar growth medium in petri dishes. The "smooth" variant does not produce as much exopolysaccharide and does not form biofilms as well as the "rugose" variant, in which the colonies appear corrugated or wrinkled. </p><p>The environmental factors that trigger the switch from one growth mode to the other are still unclear, but clues may be found in the regulatory mechanisms Yildiz is studying. With a better understanding of the pathogen's life cycle in its natural environment, researchers will be in a better position to predict and control cholera outbreaks, she said. </p><p>In nature, biofilms enable the cholera bacteria to attach themselves to a wide range of surfaces, including plankton and particles of sand. Tiny crustaceans called copepods have been found to carry thousands of cholera bacteria. </p><p>"These biofilms form on anything floating in the water, plankton included," Casper-Lindley said.</p><p>Biofilm formation is also important in many other infectious bacteria. Bacteria in biofilms are much more resistant than free-floating cells to antibiotics and disinfectants such as chlorine. Similiar molecular mechanisms are probably involved in regulating biofilm formation in different organisms, Yildiz said.</p><p>"Whatever we find in cholera bacteria may be applicable to other related pathogenic organisms, because biofilm formation is very important in many bacterial infections," she said.</p><p>Yildiz's research is supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Ellison Medical Foundation, and the UC Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program. She and other UCSC faculty recently received a $258,000 NIH grant to fund the purchase of a special type of microscope--a confocal microscope--needed to study biofilm formation. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Yildiz at (831) 459-1588 or yildiz@etox.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d76178072704601a012ff1f430099"><name>460</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Student Involvement' meeting planned for 2005-2020 LRDP&#13;

<p>WHAT IS THE Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)??</p>
<p>The 2005-2020 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) will plan for number of students enrolled, number of faculty and programs, transportation systems, land use, housing &amp; student life, community relations, infrastructure &amp; technology, and impacts to the social, built and natural environments. Once every fifteen years our campus redefines its vision, academic priorities, and physical development strategy through a Long Range Development Plan (LRDP). This is YOUR CHANCE TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF OUR CAMPUS. The LRDP will firmly impact everything (physical, academic &amp; social) about UCSC and our Community.</p>

While the Ultra Deep Field offers astronomers the deepest, most detailed view ever of the distant universe, it also underscores the unique capabilities that will be lost if the Hubble is allowed to die.</p>
<p>Congress is currently reviewing a NASA decision announced in January to cancel a planned servicing mission to the Hubble that would have extended its life past the end of the decade. Astronomers at UCSC and elsewhere have been outspoken in their support for the Hubble.</p>
<p>"The Hubble Space Telescope is the most successful telescope ever built and continues to be the centerpiece of worldwide astronomical research," said Sandra Faber, University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics. "Furthermore, Hubble is entering a new and even more productive phase in which bigger cameras enable it to map larger regions of the sky, storing away data on millions of stars and galaxies as a precious resource for future generations."</p>
<p>The Ultra Deep Field (UDF) is a deeper, more detailed version of the iconic Hubble Deep Field images obtained in 1995 and 1998. The UDF was acquired with a more powerful camera than the original deep field images, and more telescope time was devoted to it, enabling Hubble to capture light from the faintest and most distant objects ever observed. The results give scientists a view back to a time when the universe was just 5 percent of its present age, about 700 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>"These results demonstrate how incredibly powerful the Hubble is. It is exploring some of the most interesting and important science questions of our day, and without it we won't be able to do these kinds of studies," said Garth Illingworth, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>Illingworth is deputy leader of the science team for the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), one of two Hubble cameras used to obtain the UDF. He also helped plan the use of the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) to image the same field. The combination of the two cameras--the ACS detecting optical wavelengths (visible light) and NICMOS detecting infrared wavelengths--gives astronomers a wealth of valuable data.</p>
<p>"Combining these images, we should be able to look back to within several hundred million years from the Big Bang and see if we can find galaxies in the earliest stages of their evolution," Illingworth said.</p>
<p>The ACS was installed on Hubble in 2002, and a new cooling system for NICMOS was installed during the same servicing mission. Additional instrument upgrades were planned for the servicing mission that is now slated for cancellation.</p>
<p>Only the Hubble Space Telescope can provide the extremely high resolution and wide field of view needed to obtain images like the UDF. Ground-based telescopes can obtain high-resolution images using adaptive optics technology, but adaptive optics works only over a tiny field of view, and it works only at much longer wavelengths of light, said Claire Max, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and deputy director of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UCSC.</p>
<p>"Using adaptive optics on the ground is like looking through a soda straw compared to Hubble's wide-angle lens," Max said.</p>
<p>Data from Hubble are used to guide the work astronomers do at ground-based observatories around the world, Illingworth said.</p>
<p>"When it comes to understanding galaxies--how they formed and evolved into galaxies like our own Milky Way--Hubble is at the center of a web, a large network of telescopes," he said. "Astronomers use the big telescopes on the ground to further explore objects detected by Hubble."</p>
<p>Hubble provides exquisitely detailed images of distant galaxies, showing their size and brightness and what kinds of stars they hold. Large ground-based telescopes, such as the Keck Telescopes, are needed to perform the spectroscopic analysis that can tell astronomers exactly how far away a galaxy is and other important properties. But without wide-field surveys like the UDF, astronomers wouldn't know where to point their giant ground-based telescopes to find those faint galaxies.</p>
<p>"It's an amazingly complementary activity. We can do so much more by using both together than we could ever do using ground-based telescopes alone," Illingworth said.</p>
<p>The original Hubble Deep Field image contained hundreds of tiny flecks and blobs of light that further analysis proved to be distant galaxies in the early stages of their evolution. But as deep as that image was, many of the most distant galaxies were extremely faint, and some were barely detectable. The UDF, with its higher resolution and wider field of view, is expected to reveal more distant objects in greater detail than astronomers have ever seen. (Details available at <a href="http://hubblesite.org/news/2004/07">hubblesite.org/news/2004/07</a>.)</p>
<p>"I expect the UDF to be as important as the original Hubble Deep Field has been in opening up new opportunities to study new objects, as well as objects we know about but don't yet understand," Illingworth said.</p>

The awards are a new addition to the annual dinner, which raises funds for the education programs at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. Congressman Sam Farr will make the award presentations at the gala event, which will take place at the Bittersweet Bistro in Rio Del Mar.</p><p>The first Global Oceans Awards recognize two of the top students engaged in ocean-related research projects at UC Santa Cruz. Veronica Vigilant, a third-year graduate student in ocean sciences, is studying domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by certain marine algae, and how it affects marine life in Monterey Bay. Morgan Bond, a first-year graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology, is studying the growth and survival of steelhead trout on the Central California Coast. </p><p>"We believe students like these will play a crucial role in promoting a better understanding and appreciation for the oceans in the decades to come," said Richard Beal, education chair of the Friends of Long Marine Lab Board of Directors. </p><p>The Gourmet Dinner has long been one of the group's most popular fundraising events. It is hosted this year by the proprietors of the Bittersweet Bistro, chef Thomas Vinolus and his wife Elizabeth. The dinner will feature a five-course feast paired with fine wines from award-winning California vintners. </p><p>Beal said that when the Friends of Long Marine Lab Board of Directors discussed making an award ceremony part of the annual fundraising dinner, they decided to honor young scientists at the start of their careers, and to have the awards presented to them by someone noted for lifetime achievements in marine conservation. The group chose Congressman Farr, who was instrumental in the establishment of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and has been a reliable champion of ocean conservation efforts, to be the first presenter of the Global Oceans Awards. </p><p>Vigilant and Bond had the top-ranked proposals among the 15 students who received research support from the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards this year. These awards provided nearly $10,000 in total funding for undergraduate and graduate student research projects in the marine sciences. </p><p>Vigilant is working with Mary Silver, professor of ocean sciences, who has been studying the domoic acid toxin and the algae that produce it since the early 1990s. Blooms of the toxin-producing algae occur periodically in Monterey Bay and have been linked to poisonings of sea lions and seabirds. Previous research has shown how the toxin moves through the food web in surface waters, accumulating in sardines and anchovies that feed on the algae, and eventually poisoning animals that eat those fish. Vigilant is investigating whether the toxin also moves into deep waters offshore, where other organisms might be affected. </p><p>Bond is working with Mark Carr, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Bruce MacFarlane, a researcher at the National Marine Fisheries Service lab in Santa Cruz, to study the steelhead that spawn in Scott Creek north of Santa Cruz. This and other coastal steelhead populations in California are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Bond's research focuses on the juvenile fish as they move downstream and make the transition from the freshwater habitat where they hatched to the ocean where they will grow to adulthood. In particular, he is interested in the factors that influence the growth rates of the juveniles and their subsequent survival in the ocean.</p><p>For more information about the benefit Gourmet Dinner, or to make reservations, call Lisa Rose at (831) 459-3694.

They're all part of Faculty Works: 2004, an exhibition of innovative photography, video installation, and printmaking that will be presented by UCSC's Sesnon Art Gallery from March 31 to May 1. The show will feature works by associate professor of art E.G. Crichton, new assistant professor Jimin Lee, and Art Department chair Norman Locks.</p>
<p>Crichton has blown up dozens of name-brand bars of soap in a microwave oven for her two-part "Little Disasters" project. These distorted objects were then scanned or photographed to undergo further transformation on the computer, eventually ending up as 30-by 40-inch prints. The series is titled "Spotless."</p>
<p>She said this work is informed by her research on the history of soap advertising in Britain and the United States, a legacy rooted in promises to the consumer about racial purity, gender, and upward mobility.</p>
<p>"Starting in the mid-19th century, the ads promised people that soap would make their skin whiter, help them get the right job, and boost their marriage prospects," Crichton said. "There's something very satisfying about exploding these icons of hygiene and purity into less respectable shapes."</p>
<p>Crichton has so far created about 25 soap images for the "Spotless" series. She will exhibit three of them at the Sesnon show. Two others are currently on exhibit at the Center on Contemporary Art in Seattle.</p>

<p>The second part of Crichton's "Little Disasters" will be an installation of four video loops--one large projection on a wall, and three on monitors. She noted that the project is a work-in-progress that has been markedly influenced by the post 9/11 world.</p>
<p>"I've been staging little acts of destruction in my kitchen," she said, "capturing them up close in video. A hammer smashes a perfect egg, for example, or a meat cleaver cruelly slices a flower."</p>
<p>"When the Oakland fires happened in 1991, I started collecting ashes from my backyard and burning things in my house such as photos and papers," Crichton explained. "These became the pages of an artist book called My Fire. It was part of a process of empathizing with that disaster, of trying to come to terms with it. Sometimes I use art to do that--to come to terms with difficult things in life. 'Little Disasters' came about that way."</p>
<p>Jimin Lee joined the UCSC art faculty last fall as an assistant professor specializing in print media. An instructor for the past three years at the San Francisco Art Institute, Cal State Hayward, and San Francisco State University, Lee has exhibited at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in the Bay Area and Anchor Graphics in Chicago, as well as galleries in Rome, Germany, and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Lee plans to introduce the Santa Cruz community to her recent work, which combines photo etchings with digital printing. She said her subject matter consists of everyday objects which are in constant contact with her body, including books, an espresso coffeemaker, and a blender.</p>
<p>"This work has developed and slowly evolved from when I was in graduate school in 1990 at Korea's Seoul National University," Lee noted. "At that time, I only selected objects that touched my mouth-forks, wineglasses, chopsticks. I was inspired by the French post-structuralist philosopher Gilles Deleuze."</p>
<p>Lee employs numerous plates in each of her etchings to heighten the complexity of the images. "It can sometimes take up to six months to finish a print," she said.</p>
<p>"Domestic Landscapes" is the title of art professor and department chair Norman Locks's portion of the exhibit. Locks has been scanning photographs taken with the Polaroid I-Zone camera containing miniature details of everyday household experiences, and reconstructing them using digital imaging techniques.</p>
<p>Widely recognized for his experimentation with Polaroids and digital processes, Locks observed that there are both historical and autobiographical motivations for his current project.</p>
<p>"It's probably a throwback to the work I did in the mid and late '70s," he said. "When I was going through undergraduate and graduate school, I was married with children, so the images that were important to me were ordinary, domestic household scenes. But 30 years ago I was working on projects using a Polaroid SX-70 camera, and today I'm using the Polaroid I-Zone--the most recent incarnation of the Polaroid camera-- which was introduced to me by my grandchildren."</p>
<p>"Another interesting aspect of this project is that I'm linking an instant, inexpensive camera with a highly technological and expensive scanner and printer," he added. "So it's kind of a low-tech, high-tech collision as well."</p>
<p>Locks has taught photography for the past three decades. He joined the UCSC art faculty in 1977 and has been chair of the department since 1996.</p>

Recently published studies showed that the sensor detects glucose under physiological conditions, giving a reversible fluorescent signal that changes intensity in response to changes in the concentration of glucose. </p><p>Bakthan Singaram, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, has been working on the glucose sensor for the past four years, along with visiting scientist Rich Wessling and several graduate students. The team's latest results were published in December in the international journal Angewandte Chemie. </p><p>"We are very excited about the prospects for our optical glucose sensor to be used in a viable device for continuous glucose monitoring," Singaram said.</p><p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the body's ability to produce or respond to insulin, the hormone that allows glucose to enter the body's cells and be stored or used for energy. Many diabetics require insulin injections, and all must carefully monitor and manage their blood glucose levels. For millions of diabetics, this means drawing blood several times a day, usually from finger pricks. But glucose levels can fluctuate widely throughout the day, making it difficult to know when to do the blood tests for optimal control of glucose levels. </p><p>A device that can provide continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels has been eagerly sought by many research groups for more than a decade, with limited success. Singaram started working to develop a glucose sensor at the suggestion of Paul Levin, founder of Palco Labs, a Santa Cruz company that makes products for diabetics. Palco funded the first two years of research on the optical glucose sensor, but was eventually unable to continue its support. </p><p>"The support from Palco Labs carried us through the early stages when we were stumbling around and trying to figure out how to do this," Wessling said.</p><p>Singaram's group is now collaborating with a local company, Glumetrics LLC, which is developing a line of products based on the optical glucose sensor. Glumetrics was founded by Singaram's colleague Todd Wipke, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, but not a member of Singaram's research team.</p><p>"I thought it was a good project and wanted to see if I could put together a group of investors and a management team to take it on and develop the applications," said Wipke, who chairs the Board of Directors of Glumetrics. </p><p>The optical glucose sensor consists of a fluorescent chemical complex immobilized in a "thin-film hydrogel." The hydrogel, a biocompatible polymer similar to that used to make soft contact lenses, is permeable to glucose. The sensing system has two components: a fluorescent dye and a "quencher" that is responsive to glucose. In the absence of glucose, the quencher binds to the dye and prevents fluorescence, while the interaction of glucose with the quencher leads to dissociation of the complex and an increase in fluorescence. </p><p>Singaram's team tested the sensor by mounting it in a flow cell and circulating a solution with varying concentrations of glucose through the cell. The results showed that the system functions as a continuous glucose monitor capable of operating under physiological conditions. The sensor shows outstanding glucose response over the full range of glucose levels that might occur in a diabetic, Singaram said.</p><p>"This is the first system to show reversible optical sensing of glucose with a thin-film hydrogel. We tested the sensor under conditions that are as close as possible to the physiological conditions under which a continuous glucose monitor would have to operate," he said.</p><p>In addition to Singaram and Wessling, the authors of the recent paper include Jeff Suri, now a postdoctoral researcher at Scripps Research Institute, and graduate students David Cordes and Frank Cappuccio.</p><p>The researchers have also applied the hydrogel to the end of an optical fiber, enabling the signal from the glucose sensor to be transmitted through the optical fiber.</p><p>The application of this technology that is closest to yielding a marketable product is a catheter device, called GluCath, for monitoring blood glucose levels in hospitalized patients, Wipke said. Glucose levels must be regularly monitored in patients in intensive care units and others being fed intravenously with glucose drips. Research has shown that tight control of blood glucose levels can significantly reduce mortality of ICU patients, but the only way to do this currently is by taking frequent blood samples for analysis, which is painful for the patient and expensive for the hospital. </p><p>"The GluCath catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and gives a continuous reading, and it can sound an alarm if the glucose level goes too high or too low. GluCath should reduce pain, reduce costs, and reduce deaths," Wipke said. </p><p>An implantable glucose monitor for diabetics is the next product in the pipeline, he said. Other companies have used different technologies to develop continuous glucose monitors for diabetics, but currently there is nothing on the market that is effective enough to be used in place of the standard blood tests. </p><p>"Every conceivable method of detection has been explored, with very limited success, even after years of intensive research and development," Singaram said. </p><p>In Singaram's sensing system, glucose modulates the fluorescent signal by binding reversibly to a boronic acid component attached to the quencher molecule. Singaram's team designed the fluorescent dye (an anionic pyranine sulfonamide monomer) and the quencher (benzyl viologen with a boronic acid functional group attached). The fluorescence is stimulated by light from an LED and can be easily measured because it occurs at a distinct wavelength from the LED light.</p><p>"This technology satisfies all of the requirements for a working optical glucose sensor--it operates in the physiological pH range in blood or water, it can be stimulated by LED light, the response time is very fast, and the compounds are stable and don't degrade over time," Wipke said.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges for an implantable device is the body's tendency to encapsulate any foreign substance. Encapsulation could affect the ability of glucose to reach the sensor. If this problem can be overcome, however, an implantable glucose monitor would provide the crucial "missing link" in the development of an artificial pancreas. </p><p>Insulin pumps are already available that diabetics can use to deliver their insulin doses instead of giving themselves injections. In concept, at least, an artificial pancreas is simply a continuous glucose monitor connected to an insulin pump that is programmed to deliver appropriate doses of insulin to maintain healthy blood glucose levels. </p><p>"That is the holy grail that many people have been pursuing. It won't cure diabetes, but it would make management of the disease a lot easier," Singaram said.</p><p>Singaram's research on the glucose sensor is funded by UC's BioStar Discovery Grant program in collaboration with Glumetrics. </p><p>"It is a great example of successful technology transfer from the university to a company that can commercialize on this," Wipke said. "The collaboration has enabled the research to flourish and supported graduate student education at the university, and it has enabled the start of a new company in the Santa Cruz area."</p><p>Glumetrics is based at the UC Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology (MBEST) Center in Marina, where UCSC is helping to establish a community of high-technology businesses through strategic partnerships with the education and research institutions in the Monterey Bay Area.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Singaram at (831) 459-3154 or singaram@chemistry.ucsc.edu and Wipke at (831) 459-2397 or wipke@chemistry.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914d7ec08072704601a012ffd37abcfb"><name>467</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Century Project challenges stereotypes of the female body</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1080111600000</start-date><display-name>Century Project challenges stereotypes...</display-name><path>/2004/03/467</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/03/467</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338029199</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338029199</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Century Project is a remarkable exhibition that challenges stereotypical views of the female body, the nature of voyeurism, and the cycle of aging. </p><p>Featuring 70 photographs of unclothed girls and woman in chronological order-from a newborn baby to a woman in her 90s-it is designed to provoke thought and discussion about subjects that are often taboo in our society, such as aging, nudity, violence, heath issues, and the portrayal of women in the media. Most of the photographs are accompanied by intensely personal, and often moving, written statements by the subjects about their bodies and their experience of being photographed.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFCC33" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Week of Events Scheduled for UCSC and Downtown Santa Cruz: April 12-18</font></b></td></tr></table>The Institute for Advanced Feminist Research (IAFR) at UC Santa Cruz will present the Century Project April 12-15 at Kresge College on campus, and April 16-18 at the Veterans Memorial Building in downtown Santa Cruz. This marks the first large-scale public event for the new institute, which has been primarily in the planning stage since its founding in 2001. IAFR director Helene Moglen, a professor of literature at UCSC, said that the exhibit has toured nationally in galleries, colleges, and universities, noting that the photographs are often used by therapists and counselors.</p><p>"In their statements, some of the women discuss what it means to have been abused as children and how they view their bodies differently as a result of participating  in the project," Moglen said. "They describe how they are now able to see themselves not just as abused bodies, but in other more positive ways. There is an impressive range of women represented in the exhibition, including some who have had mastectomies, and others who are self-cutters, anorexic, or disabled."</p><p>"It's very surprising to me; I would not have expected girls and women to seek out this form of expression," Moglen added. "One thing I realized as I looked at the photos for the first time is that the real taboo body in our culture-the body we have least exposure to and perhaps the most anxiety about-is the unclothed body of the old woman." </p><p>Moglen pointed out that the exhibit contradicts the common stereotype of the glamorous young woman and the rather reticent older woman.</p><p>"It's remarkable how sad many of the young women in the exhibition seem, and how much discontent they express about their bodies-even though they are often  regarded as beautiful," Moglen observed. "And it's amazing that the older women in their 80s and 90s are so comfortable, even joyous, in their bodies."</p><p>As part of the exhibition, Moglen said there would be a number of panels and discussions held throughout the week on a variety of issues, ranging from body image to the responsibilities of the photographer in taking these types of photos. Speakers will include Dr. Catherine Forest, associate physician at UCSC's Cowell Student Health Center; Eileen Zurbrigger, UCSC assistant professor of psychology, Donna Hunter, UCSC associate professor of art history; and Century Project photographer Frank Cordelle. </p><p>"Another very interesting thing about this exhibition is that you have a male photographer taking photographs of unclothed women," Moglen said. "But there's a great difference when photographs of this sort are accompanied by personal statements. Because there are comments with the images, the women become the subjects, not the objects of the photographs."</p><p>"That raises interesting questions about the conditions that produce voyeurism and how we can change that voyeuristic circuit of looking," she added. "Men may come to Century looking for the naked or the nude body, and they might find instead the body that is unclothed."</p><p>Cordelle has been working on the Century Project for the past 20 years and hopes to have it published in book form in the near future. He has worked as a freelance photographer for a variety of ad agencies and magazines, including Life and Newsweek, and has had more than 50 magazine covers published throughout his professional career. </p><p>Moglen noted that the ultimate purpose in bringing the exhibit to Santa Cruz is to promote thoughtful discussion that will cross generations--from high school age students to retired senior citizens. She added that the mission of UCSC's Institute for Advanced Feminist Research is to help build bridges, not only between research and activism, but also between the campus and the community. </p><p>"When you think of body image these days, you think of what an important phenomenon it is in our culture right now, particularly with piercing, tattoos, and plastic surgery across age groups," Moglen said. "This exhibit provides the community with an opportunity to talk cross-generationally about all of these issues. The immediacy of the photographs is quite powerful in provoking conversations and debate."</p><p>_____</p><p>The Century Project will be on display Monday, April 12, through Thursday, April 15, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m at UCSC's Kresge College 159.

Keeping data in the optical domain during routing and packet switching would remove a major bottleneck, but requires fundamentally new networking technology. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are part of the first large-scale project to tackle this issue.</p><p>Led by Lucent Technologies and its research and development arm, Bell Laboratories, and funded by a four-year, $12.5 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the program aims to develop a high-capacity router based on all-optical technologies. The research team includes collaborators from UCSC, Lehigh University, and Agility Communications. </p><p>Anujan Varma, professor of computer engineering at UCSC, is working on developing the system architecture and algorithms for the new optical router technology. Bell Laboratories is responsible for the underlying optical device techologies. The proposed optical router is called the Integrated Router Interconnected Spectrally (IRIS).</p><p>"The IRIS system will be very different from current routers," Varma said. "It is quite a huge undertaking, but if it succeeds it will fundamentally change the nature of data communications."</p><p>With the volume of Internet traffic roughly doubling every year, the routers that process all that traffic will eventually have to have much higher capacities than those currently available. The high-capacity routers now on the market are bulky, expensive, and power-hungry, and building even higher-capacity routers with existing technologies will be difficult, Varma said. The IRIS program is taking a completely novel approach to the problem.</p><p>The work of Varma's group on the system architecture will help guide the team's technology development efforts by defining precisely the requirements for the optical devices. Most of the funding will go toward the development of the optical device technologies. Varma's group will receive about $750,000 of the DARPA grant. </p><p>A big concern for Varma is how the new system can be made compatible with the current Internet infrastructure.</p><p>"There is a big gap between the two technologies, so compatibility is a major challenge," he said.</p><p>There are even greater challenges on the technology development side. Many new optical technologies have been developed in recent years, but they are not yet at the point where they can be used to build the kind of system envisioned for IRIS, Varma said.</p><p>Data storage, in particular, is a critical problem for an optical router. A router needs to have internal memory where data are temporarily stored before being forwarded to a new destination. That is very hard to do optically, but researchers at Bell Laboratories have developed photonic integrated circuits that can, in effect, keep optical signals circulating around within the chip.</p><p>"The capacity is limited, but it is a good starting point," Varma said. </p><p>The IRIS program aims to have a small working prototype in four years. But it could be 10 to 20 years before a fully optical high-capacity router is ready for the market, Varma said.</p><p>"This is such a long term effort that industry is not going to fund it, so this is where government funding is needed," he said. </p><p>DARPA also plans to fund a second group to work on the same problem. The Internet itself grew out of an earlier DARPA program (ARPANET), and the agency is known for funding innovative and creative research projects. </p><p>Varma is well known in the networking industry for his research in the areas of high-speed switching and routing, optical networks, traffic scheduling, and congestion control. An earlier project in which he worked with researchers at UC Berkeley and Stanford led to a successful prototype of an optical switch.</p><p>"That was similar to what we are doing now, but on a smaller scale," Varma said.</p><p>He has also worked with Bell Labs researchers on previous projects, and the IRIS team includes one of his former students, Dimitrios Stiliadis. Stiliadis earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer engineering at UCSC and is now a Distinguished Member of the Technical Staff at Bell Labs. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Varma at (831) 459-3505 or varma@soe.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d0cf78072704601a012ff3a95e2ab"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626358478</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626358478</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><system-folder id="eadd840d807270461673f47d38d38993"><name>images</name><is-published>true</is-published><path>/2004/03/images</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/03/images</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1348265149434</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1348265149434</last-modified></system-folder><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d0cf78072704601a012ff3a95e2ab"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626358478</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626358478</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
