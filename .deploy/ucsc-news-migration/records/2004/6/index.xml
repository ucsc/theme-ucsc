In the new book <i>The Perfect Sister: What Draws Us Together, What Drives Us Apart</i> (New York, NY: Harcourt, Inc., 2004) sociologist Marcia Millman explores the complicated sister relationship and the familial forces that shape it. From the adult sisters who make secret trips to the plastic surgeon together to the visually impaired youngster whose older sister ditches her on the way to school, the sister relationship offers unparalleled opportunities for closeness and estrangement.</p><p>	"The emotional connection between sisters is very important, and it hadn't been explored in a serious way," said Millman, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who interviewed nearly 100 women of diverse backgrounds from around the country and, in many cases, more than one sister from the same family. </p><p>In The Perfect Sister, Millman sheds light on the unique ways sisters can help each other overcome the sorrows and disappointments of childhood, and she offers insight into the reasons some sisters never feel close. For many sisters, a big hurdle is "failing to see the person who is actually there,"  or relating to what Millman calls the "imagined sister... the sister we wish for." </p><p>"I think sisters can help repair the injuries of childhood," said Millman. "It can happen when you're young or when you're old, and it can create a bond that is very gratifying. But to do that, women have to look beyond their own perspectives and see their sisters for who they really are, not as extensions of themselves but as individuals with unique experiences." </p><p>Based on her research, Millman identified the following factors that shape individual childhood experiences and have lasting effects on sister relationships:</p><p>. Parental favoritism -- "I think it happens even if parents try not to let it happen," said Millman.</p><p>. Older sisters who are tapped to help raise younger children -- "Ideally, parents shouldn't do that, but life is not always ideal."</p><p>. Mothers who enlist their eldest daughter as confidante -- "They're not really thinking about what that daughter needs," said Millman. "They're satisfying their own need."</p><p>Sisters remain influential figures in each other's lives into adulthood, and Millman encourages adult sisters to step back and assess each other independently of how their parents did. "It's common for the favored sister to look at her sibling in the same disparaging way her parents did, but that's very damaging for grown sisters who want an equal relationship," said Millman.</p><p>	In families where the mother or father chose one daughter to confide in, siblings may never form childhood alliances with each other. "As adults, some sisters recognize how divisive that was, and this frees them to become friends," said Millman. Likewise, it can be difficult for older sisters who had more than their share of responsibility in the family to overcome the resentment and anger they often feel toward their younger siblings. "Some siblings seem to get locked inside a time capsule. We need to stop relating to anachronistic images and relate to the person who's there in the present," said Millman.</p><p>Many adult women also fail to recognize the differences in how they and their sisters grew up. Instead, they fall into the trap of expecting their sister to behave or respond exactly as they would, an expectation that fuels misunderstanding and disappointment, said Millman. </p><p>Relationships aren't cast in stone, however, and Millman found that sisters who were close as children didn't necessarily stay close as adults, and vice versa. Age difference had little bearing on how well sisters got along as adults. Millman was surprised by the number of women who reported having had a difficult mother, but attentive mothers didn't guarantee a close sibling relationship, either.</p><p>"Despite all these challenges, most adult women expect to be close to their sister, and it's upsetting when they're not getting along," she said. "Sisters are an important part of women's emotional lives."</p><p>Adult sisters often come together around shared experiences, such as childbearing and caring for elderly parents, said Millman. "When parents get sick, you're drawn into a relationship with your siblings again," she said. "After parents die, siblings become even more important emotionally, because they are your only tie to your childhood."</p><p>	In the meantime, Millman encourages women to work on their relationships with their sisters.</p><p>"People work at relationships with spouses, partners, and children, but they don't always think they have to work on their relationships with their siblings," said Millman. "Some sisters are fortunate, and they have an easy relationship. But for those who don't, or when problems come up, they need to remember that every close attachment has conflicts. If they value the relationship, there's a real incentive to work it out. I think sisters can make up, and they're happier when they do. It's worth the effort."</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Marcia Millman can be reached via e-mail at millman@ucsc.edu or by contacting Jennifer McNulty in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4399 or jmcnulty@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dc8b28072704601a012ffa481fa4c"><name>514</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Excellence  in Teaching Award winners announced</title><author>Louise Donahue (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1086073200000</start-date><display-name>Excellence  in Teaching...</display-name><path>/2004/06/514</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/06/514</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338048107</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338048107</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Eight faculty members have received  2003-04 Excellence in Teaching Awards from the Academic Senate Committee on Teaching.

While evolving Adobe's market strategy and extending its customer reach, Chizen also has maintained the company's legendary employee culture. In 2004, Adobe ranked sixth in Fortune magazine's annual report on the "100 Best Companies to Work For."</p><p>Prior to becoming CEO, Chizen defined new market opportunities and led the development of products as Adobe's executive vice president of worldwide products and marketing. He previously held key marketing and sales positions at Mattel Electronics, Microsoft Corporation, and Claris Corporation. Chizen holds a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College, City University of New York. He serves on the board of Synopsys, Inc., and is president of the board of directors for the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose.</p><p>UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, founded in 1997, is building excellence in three critical areas: information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. Inherently interdisciplinary, these areas complement and supplement each other, advancing the school's strength and promise. The school serves the needs of the greater Silicon Valley region and the state of California by creating and disseminating knowledge through research and teaching, and by offering curricula that nurture creative thinking and prepare students for productive careers at industrial and academic settings in rapidly evolving areas of science and engineering.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dcd028072704601a012ff21805924"><name>517</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: Bio industry group from Russia and U.S. State Department will visit UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, June 10</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-4352; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1086764400000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: Bio industry...</display-name><path>/2004/06/517</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/06/517</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338049232</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338049232</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A delegation of Russian scientists working through the U.S. State Department's BioIndustry Initiative will participate in a full-day program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on Thursday, June 10.

At that performance in Berlin, Nagano made the unprecedented and daring programming choice to combine works from the 15th and 20th centuries--juxtaposing Houghton's transcription of Ockeghem's Renaissance mass Missa Au travail suis with Mahler's Ninth Symphony.</p><p>Houghton has been researching and translating works by 15th-century composers into modern musical notation for the past 25 years. The mass performed at the Ojai Festival is one of 40 works known as the Chigi Codex, that Houghton is preparing for publication in a critical edition for the series Monuments of Renaissance Music by the University of Chicago Press. </p><p>"Editions of this music are needed by most musicians and music scholars because the system of musical notation, like other living languages, has changed in the course of five centuries," Houghton noted. "In addition to interpreting obsolete signs and changed meanings, the editor can supply missing but essential information, such as text, tempo indications, and pitch alterations originally added by oral tradition in performance."</p><p>Houghton traveled to Ojai last week to present a pre-concert lecture on Ockeghem's music at the Ojai Festival. Houghton also attended the Early Music America conference in Berkeley last week to participate in a panel discussion of performance issues in Ockeghem's music. Chanticleer additionally performed Houghton's new edition of the mass in Berkeley at St. Mark's Church.  </p><p>A former student of Houghton, Nagano graduated with degrees in music and sociology from UC Santa Cruz in 1974. He is currently musical director of the Los Angeles Opera, Berkeley Symphony, and the Deutsches Symphonie.  </p><p>"It's been a series of wonderful thrills to witness Kent's meteoric succession of musical achievements in Berkeley, Lyon, Berlin, and Los Angeles," Houghton noted. "And I am anticipating more to come, beginning in 2006, with his recently announced appointments as music director for both the historic Bavarian State Opera in Munich and the Montreal Symphony."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dd1328072704601a012ff2796a03f"><name>519</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Six faculty members named to provost positions at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Louise Donahue (831) 459-5312; donahue@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1087542000000</start-date><display-name>Six faculty members named...</display-name><path>/2004/06/519</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/06/519</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338050308</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338050308</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Six faculty members are being either appointed or reappointed to positions as college provosts, Lynda J. Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education at UC Santa Cruz, has announced.</p><p>"These college provosts are fundamental to the character of UCSC," Goff said, "A provost is the academic head of the college and is an important figure in the lives of our undergraduates. Provosts symbolize and in some senses personify the colleges for students, alumni, and the entire campus. I am very pleased that we have found such exceptional faculty to take on these positions."</p><p>Provosts have been appointed or reappointed at the following colleges:</p><p>College Eight: </p><p>Lecturer and Writing Program chair Roswell (Roz) Spafford has been appointed provost of College Eight.  Spafford graduated from UCSC's Merrill College in 1971, having majored in community studies and done fieldwork with the United Farm Workers. After graduate work at San Francisco State University in creative writing, she returned to the campus as a faculty member in 1978.  She has taught in the Writing Program ever since, serving as its chair from 2001 to the present. Commenting on her appointment, Spafford said, "I am very honored to have the opportunity to support the wonderful work College Eight staff and faculty have been doing." </p><p>Cowell College: </p><p>In a new situation for UCSC, associate professors of literature Tyrus Miller and Deanna Shemek have been appointed co-provosts for Cowell College starting in January 2005. Shemek came to UCSC in 1990 after teaching at Yale University.  She has received a variety of prestigious awards in recent years, including the American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship in 1995 and the Harvard Villa I Tatti Fellowship in 2001. Miller came to UCSC from Yale in 1999, and was director of the UC Education Abroad Program in Budapest, Hungary, from 2001 to 2004.  In addition to these scholarly distinctions, Shemek and Miller have also both been active in Cowell College since arriving on campus. Shemek and Miller said they are honored to carry on the strong traditions of Cowell, and at the same time, eager to try some new ideas and directions for the College. Professor emeritus of chemistry Stanley Williamson, who has served as provost for the last academic year, will continue as provost until January 2005. Williamson has been active in the college and on campus for many years, and agreed to continue his service on behalf of Cowell until the new provosts take office. </p><p>Crown College:</p><p>Crown College is welcoming professor of computer engineering F. Joel Ferguson back for a second term as provost. Ferguson was one of the primary authors on the proposal to integrate the college core courses and the campus composition requirements. Provost Ferguson's primary focus during his next term will be to increase the involvement of faculty in the college.</p><p>Kresge College: </p><p>Having previously served as provost of Kresge College from 1996 to 2001, professor of literature Paul Skenazy will return to the college for a second stint as provost. He has taught at UCSC since 1971, and his scholarly work ranges from popular culture to ethnic literature.  During his earlier service as provost,  Skenazy helped make Kresge the heart of transfer student life at UCSC, establishing a center for transfer students which was the first of its kind in the University of California system. "I hope in the next few years to build on my earlier efforts, especially in integrating faculty research with undergraduate course work," Skenazy said. "I would also like to find ways to make the colleges more responsive to members of the local community."</p><p>Porter College: </p><p>Porter College Provost David Evan Jones has been reappointed to another three-year term, which starts July 1. During his first term as provost, Jones launched several initiatives, including a gospel choir course, a course in queer studies, a community service course taught by dancer/choreographer Tandy Beal, a research assistant program for Porter students, and the George Hitchcock Poetry Fund. In his second term, Jones hopes to collaborate with the Division of Arts in creating a nationally visible festival of digital arts/new media at UCSC.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914dd28a8072704601a012ffe56f15d1"><name>520</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC scientist leads expedition to establish seafloor observatories</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1087801200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC scientist leads expedition...</display-name><path>/2004/06/520</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/06/520</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338050647</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1373407856964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2004/06/field-area.jpg</path><link>site://news/2004/06/field-area.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>field-area.jpg</name><display-name>field-area.jpg</display-name><file-size>61852</file-size><width>280</width><height>274</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>This map shows the location of the field area for IODP Expedition 301 in the Northeast Pacific.

It will be the first expedition of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), an ambitious new international collaboration set up to succeed the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), which supported 20 years of international expeditions to study the ocean floor and obtain evidence of Earth's history from seafloor sediments.</p>
<p>Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is co-chief scientist of this first IODP expedition, along with Tetsuro Urabe of the University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>The amount of water that circulates through the upper oceanic crust is equivalent to the combined flows of all the rivers that pour off of the continents, Fisher said. Driven by slight differences in temperature and pressure within the seafloor, this "hydrothermal flow" is enough to recirculate all of the water in the oceans through the seafloor every few hundred thousand years, he said.</p>
<p>"This process affects the chemistry of the ocean, changes the properties of the crust itself, and influences the microbial communities that live below the seafloor," Fisher said. "We know it's important, but we really don't understand much about how it works."</p>
<p>The researchers will be drilling holes deep into the seafloor and capping the holes with elaborate structures called "CORKs" that will enable scientists to monitor processes beneath the seafloor and conduct experiments. These advanced seafloor observatories allow measurements of temperature, pressure, fluid chemistry, and microbiology to be obtained from different depths in the borehole. The CORKs, which stand about two stories high on the ocean floor, cap boreholes that extend hundreds of meters through the seafloor sediments and into the "basement rocks," the basalt of the upper oceanic crust. One function of the CORKs is to allow conditions within the boreholes to equilibrate.</p>
<p>"When you drill the hole, you change the temperature and the pressure and you contaminate things, and the only way to get back to equilibrium is to seal it up and let it sit for awhile," Fisher explained. "The CORKs basically plug the hole. They also have lots of valves and connections where we can hook up to them with a submarine or an ROV [remotely operated vehicle] and take measurements from different intervals in the borehole."</p>
<p>The researchers plan to put in four observatories this summer. The observatories will enable them to conduct a kind of standard hydrogeologic testing commonly done on land, known as a "cross-hole test."</p>
<p>"In a cross-hole test, you pump in one hole and monitor in several other holes. No one's ever done this in the seafloor. The environment is different, but in principle it's the same thing anyone would do to test an aquifer," Fisher said.</p>
<p>The expedition (IODP Expedition 301) will depart from Astoria, Oregon, on June 28, 2004, on the research vessel JOIDES Resolution, a well-equipped drilling platform used for years in the ODP. The scientists will be returning to an area about 120 miles (200 kilometers) west of Vancouver Island that Fisher and his collaborators previously studied eight years ago on ODP Leg 168. In a paper published last year in Nature, the researchers reported their discovery of fluid flow between a pair of seamounts in this area that are separated by more than 30 miles (52 kilometers).</p>
<p>"One of the big surprises from Leg 168 was that the flow rates were very high, and yet the driving forces are just a couple of pounds per square inch, not even the equivalent of one atmosphere of pressure," Fisher said. "The ocean crust is very permeable, with wide open cracks and fractures, so the driving forces are very small."</p>
<p>The Juan de Fuca Ridge, west of the drill site, is a place where new oceanic crust is being built as two oceanic plates spread apart and fresh lava pours out of the seafloor. To the east, the Juan de Fuca Plate dives beneath the edge of the North American Plate.</p>
<p>This new expedition is an opportunity to ask some basic questions about the plumbing system in the seafloor, Fisher said.</p>
<p>"The upper oceanic crust is the largest aquifer on Earth--it covers two-thirds of the planet. But it's a complicated system, and we don't know how well connected it is," he said. "Can you pump in one place and see a response a kilometer away? If you pump at one depth, can you see a response 500 meters below? Those are very basic questions if you want to build a model of the system. A lot of people have published papers with models of the seafloor and no data--I've done it myself. This is an opportunity to get the kind of information we need to understand the system."</p>
<p>New drillships equipped with different drilling technologies are being developed for the IODP, and Fisher's group plans to return to the site in a few years with one of these new vessels to conduct additional experiments.</p>
<p>"We'll drill another hole in between these observatories and then do some experiments where we pump into the formation and monitor the response all around it. We'll also do long-term experiments where we inject chemical tracers," he said.</p>
<p>All the water circulating through the ocean crust has implications on land where the oceanic plates are subducted beneath the continental plates. The explosiveness of volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens, for example, is due to water that ends up mixed with molten rock when oceanic plates are subducted deep into the Earth. Water in subduction zones may also affect the behavior of earthquake faults.</p>
<p>The investigation will also address questions that are of general interest to hydrogeologists who study complicated rock systems on land as well as on the seafloor, Fisher said.</p>
<p>The JOIDES Resolution is currently docked in Astoria, Oregon, for the first port call of the IODP. Tours for reporters and other visitors will be given on Friday, June 25. The expedition departs on June 28. For information about the media event on June 25, please contact Regina Deavers at (202) 232-3900 x1614 or rdeavers@joiscience.org.</p>
<p>The IODP is an international scientific research endeavor funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan, and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling to conduct basic research into the history of the ocean basins and the overall nature of the crust beneath the seafloor. IODP will use new resources to support technologically advanced ocean drilling research, which will enable investigation of Earth's regions and processes that were previously inaccessible and poorly understood.</p>
<p>The Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI), a consortium of 20 academic institutions, leads U.S. participation in the IODP through the U.S. Science Support Program (see <a href="http://joiscience.org">joiscience.org</a>). Through an alliance with Texas A&amp;M University and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, JOI leads the operations of a riserless vessel in IODP that is funded by NSF. Japan and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling will also operate platforms in the program. Japan will contribute Chikyu, a $500 million riser vessel that will begin service in 2006, and Europe will operate mission-specific platforms to ice-covered and shallow-water regions.</p>

The appearance was made possible in part through the persistence of L.S. Kim, assistant professor of film and digital media at UCSC, and Clifford Yee, program coordinator of the campus Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center. </p><p>"I teach a class called Asian Americans and the Media, and we study Lin's film  because he is one of the most prominent and contemporary Asian American film directors working today," Kim noted. "He's incredibly busy right now-working on two studio films for Disney and Universal, developing a film with Spike Lee, working on an independent project for MTV, and he even just did a pilot at Aaron Spelling's request. So we were very lucky to get him."</p><p>Lin's debut feature was the first film acquired by MTV's new distribution company, MTV Films. It first received recognition at the Sundance Film Festival where it sparked a controversy over its unusual portrayal of Asian American characters as amoral role models. The film depicts a group of high school students who appear to their classmates and teachers as model students, but in reality lead double lives as edgy, freewheeling participants in a darker world of crime and material excess. </p><p>"Lin's film speaks to one of the issues we explore in my classes," Kim said. "Asian Americans are usually stereotypically portrayed as good students who are well-behaved. But to see Asian Americans who are smart, but seriously out-of-control, is threatening. It really throws that model minority myth into turmoil."</p><p>A culturally diverse mix of nearly 200 students also had the opportunity to view a separate 30-minute video documenting Lin's struggle to get an independent film distributed about Asian Americans. </p><p>"I can count on my hands how many Asian Americans have recurring roles on television, and there are virtually none that have lead roles in Hollywood movies," Kim noted. "Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow is the first film in 10 years since Joy Luck Club to feature Asian Americans as main characters."</p><p>Students questioned Lin about everything from issues of race in the film industry to the difference between working on independent and studio films. At one point, Lin noted that the entire budget of Better Luck Tomorrow was equal to just one day of shooting for a typical Disney studio film.</p><p>"He was a very gracious and generous guest--he answered questions right down to the very last student," Kim observed. "Lin is at an extremely exciting point in his career right now, and it was truly special to watch him interact here on campus." </p><p>In May, Kim and associate professor of anthropology Nancy Chen helped  coordinate visits to UCSC film classes by noted director Alexander Payne and award-winning Canadian actress Sandra Oh. Payne received much acclaim for the Reese Witherspoon/Matthew Broderick comedy Election in 1999, and recently directed Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates in the 2002 film About Schmidt.

M. Keck Isotope Laboratory in June with a symposium on isotope analysis. The naming of the facility recognizes a $1 million grant from the W. M. Keck Foundation that enabled the campus to buy a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer for isotope analysis of trace elements. </p><p>With the addition of this powerful new ThermoFinnigan Neptune mass spectrometer to the existing array of sophisticated spectrometry instruments at UCSC, the campus's analytical facilities are unrivaled on the West Coast. </p><p>"Thanks to the generosity of the W. M. Keck Foundation, UC Santa Cruz's research capabilities have achieved a new level, making the campus a center of excellence in the region for trace metal analysis," said Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers at the dedication ceremony and symposium held on June 18.</p><p>Trace metals include toxic elements such as lead and mercury, as well as biologically essential elements, such as copper and manganese, that can be toxic at high concentrations. UCSC scientists in many different fields, from environmental toxicology to oceanography, are interested in precise measurements of trace elements. In particular, the ability to measure accurately the relative abundances of different isotopes of the same element in a sample is important to many researchers. </p><p>The Neptune, a multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) from Thermo Electron Corporation, is a new type of mass spectrometer that adds significantly to the scope of science that can be carried out at UCSC. This instrument augments the existing single-collector high-resolution ICP-MS that has played a key role in trace metals research at UCSC since 1995. At that time, the campus was the first institution in the United States to acquire a high-resolution ICP-MS. In addition to the ICP-MS instruments, the Keck Isotope Lab also houses a thermal ionization mass spectrometer, which has been used to measure calcium, lead, neodymium, and strontium isotopes. The Neptune effectively makes all the elements in the periodic table accessible for the same type of analysis, said Jugdeep Aggarwal, director of the Keck Isotope Laboratory.</p><p>"The Neptune has opened up the periodic table for exploration by scientists in a wide range of fields. They can now use isotope analysis to study virtually any aspect of the natural world. It's not a small improvement--it is a major, major advance in capability," Aggarwal said. </p><p>Thomas Bullen, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, gave the first talk of the symposium, offering an overview of topics that are ripe for investigation using the unprecedented capabilities of the Neptune. He was followed by Kenneth Sims of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who described his use of isotope analysis to investigate volcanic processes; Holger Hintelmann of Trent University in Canada, who discussed his work on mercury isotopes in the environment; and Norman Pearson of Macquarie University in Australia, who described special laser techniques for analyzing solid samples. </p><p>Aggarwal is currently testing a laser device for use with the Neptune in analyzing solid samples. Researchers can use the laser to vaporize a tiny portion of a solid sample for isotope analysis, giving them the capacity to perform separate analyses on specific parts of the sample. Otoliths, for example, are tiny ear bones in fish that are built up in annual layers like the growth rings of a tree. Isotopic analysis of the layers in fish otoliths using this laser technique can yield clues about the different environments a fish lived in throughout its life.</p><p>"The laser system will give us spatial resolution, allowing in situ isotopic analysis of solids, instead of dissolving and purifying the sample first," Aggarwal said.</p><p>The Keck Isotope Laboratory is one of the core analytical facilities at UCSC, open to researchers in a variety of disciplines on campus and throughout the UC system. The instruments available in the Keck Isotope Lab and the Marine Analytical Laboratory include, in addition to the Neptune, a thermal ionization mass spectrometer, a high-resolution ICP-MS, and an ICP optical-emission spectrometer. </p><p>"It is incredible how much the field of isotope analysis has expanded and how fast it is growing. These really are exciting times in isotope chemistry," said Margaret Delaney, interim campus provost and executive vice chancellor. Delaney, a professor of ocean sciences, hosted the symposium, which was followed by a reception, poster presentations of ongoing research at UCSC, and tours of the new laboratory. </p><p>Russell Flegal, professor and chair of environmental toxicology, spearheaded the campus's effort to acquire the Neptune mass spectrometer. He was unable to attend the symposium, but Delaney made a point of acknowledging Flegal's role.</p><p>"He helped bring us to this point by leading us all to recognize the need for this instrument and convincing us to pursue it through the Keck Foundation," she said.</p><p>The symposium was sponsored by the W. M. Keck Foundation, the Thermo Electron Corporation, and UCSC.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d6ffd8072704601a012fff9aec567"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626383818</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626383818</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27d6ffd8072704601a012fff9aec567"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2004/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2004/06/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626383818</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626383818</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
