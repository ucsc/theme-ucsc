<p>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which concluded this summer, launched quietly in 2009 and went public in 2013. &#160;With gifts of every size, 63,064 donors supported things that mattered to them personally. Two-thirds&#8212;40,274&#8212;were first-time donors to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the campus will celebrate the success of the campaign, which concluded six months ahead of schedule and exceeded its initial goal of raising $300 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard to overstate the positive impact the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz is having on our campus,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;When I look around, I see it everywhere: the rebuilt Hay Barn near the main entrance, the renovated Quarry Amphitheater in the heart of campus, new academic programs and scholarships for our students, research and teaching support for our faculty, new cultural programs and archives, deeper engagement with our alumni and community.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Students and programs that directly impact them received $143 million in support; faculty and research programs received $130 million. Donors gave $42 million toward campus enhancements and $18 million in unrestricted and other support.</p>
<p>Among the signature achievements is the addition of 16 new faculty chairs&#8212;nearly doubling the campus total. The chairs provide resources in specific academic areas and confer prestige on the chair holders to build lasting excellence. The new chairs include ones dedicated to feminist studies, environmental justice, and fighting childhood cancer through genomics. &#160;</p>
<h3>A culture of shared values</h3>
<p>&#8220;The things that make UC Santa Cruz unique&#8212;our people, programs, values, and location&#8212;resonated with donors,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;They saw opportunities to support our shared values in ways that reflected their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things like expanding classrooms in the wild, activating social change, building a network of inclusion, and launching a new graduate program in coastal science and policy. And in passions&#160;as diverse as endowing the study of modern poetry to endowing College Eight in the name of environmental pioneer Rachel Carson. In what became the largest single gift in campus history, the University Library was selected to house the Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Photography Collection&#8212;more than 12,000 photographs documenting the people, landscape, and politics of California in the mid-20th century.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing financial resources, the campus wanted its first major fundraising campaign to build a deeper culture of philanthropy on campus and in the community. That goal was achieved, too, said Alec Webster, chair of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Webster took a hands-on approach to fundraising, personally connecting with faculty members, academic leaders, and donors to make things happen. &#8220;This is not a spectator sport,&#8221; said Webster. &#8220;It takes people at all levels to make good things happen. Everybody has something to give.&#8221;</p>
<p>Webster (Rachel Carson &#8217;02, environmental studies) is a trustee of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, established by his parents. The Webster family foundation gave generously during the campaign and inspired many others to give, too.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board, comprised of volunteers from the arts and sciences, industry and community, played key roles in the campaign as donors and advisers. Trustee Linda Peterson (Stevenson, &#8217;70, history) served as chair of the board&#8217;s campaign committee, which partnered with campus leadership throughout the campaign.</p>
<h3>Celebrating, with an eye to the future</h3>
<p>This&#160;month, the 2017 Founders Celebration will showcase the impact of philanthropy on the campus and include open houses at locations where its impact is being directly felt&#8212;including at the reopened Quarry Amphitheater and the rebuilt Hay Barn. &#160;</p>
<p>In addition to the Founders Dinner on the evening of Oct. 21 and open houses earlier in the day, a special Convocation of Chairs on Oct. 20 will honor academic chair holders and donors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are celebrating this fall, but our commitment to increasing private investment in UC Santa Cruz doesn&#8217;t end here,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#160;&#8220;Rather, it has begun in earnest. We&#8217;ve seen what we can do, and we are seeing clearly why it matters so much.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Hellier sits outside the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado, answering the question about why she loves physics by talking about shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stiletto heel will exert great pressure on the ground while a flat shoe will apply much less, and physics can illuminate why that is, says the UC Santa Cruz grad student. Thanks to a U.S. Energy Department grant, Hellier is doing research into new solar cell materials that may one day be able to generate high-voltage energy instead of the low voltage delivered now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beauty of physics is the logic that goes into explaining how things work,&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hellier says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That the 30-year-old daughter of a tech-savvy chemist and assistant school superintendent with a degree in accounting would turn to talk of footwear when explaining why she loves science is not as surprising as it may seem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hellier not only has a degree from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in San Francisco and once created a clothing line around the music of Death Cab for Cutie but is also a regular at Burning Man with her own art offering, and once was part of a theater troupe that did parodies of horror movies on stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In high school, I either wanted to get a degree in math or a degree in costume design,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I also thought about becoming a criminal lawyer.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The road to the lab where Hellier now works actually began with the 2008 recession after she&#8217;d graduated from design school. There were few fashion jobs to be had, and so Hellier took a full-time, salaried job managing a Marie Callender&#8217;s restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already a self-starter, she&#8217;d started working for the chain at age 16, gradually taking on more decision-making responsibilities until, by 18, she was one of the youngest upcoming managers in what was then a huge chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But customer service and 80-hour weeks wore her out, and eventually she decided to return to school. It was at Los Medanos College in Pittsburg, Calif., that she took her first physics class and, as she says it, &#8220;fell in love.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transferring to UC Santa Cruz in 2011, she was at an informal Women in Physics dinner when she met Professor of Physics Sue Carter. Hellier didn&#8217;t know much about solar-cell research, but as she listened to Carter speak about the technology, she decided that&#8217;s what she wanted to do with her life. She asked Carter for a spot in her lab and eventually worked on projects that ranged from using algae for biofuels to researching luminescent solar concentrators, which use fluorescent dye to absorb light and make solar cells more efficient. Part of that research became the foundation for a company that provides solar panels that make agricultural greenhouses more cost-effective to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But working in a research lab as an undergraduate wasn&#8217;t always easy, says Hellier, which is where the lessons in self-starting she learned at Marie Callender&#8217;s came in handy. There was no handholding and not a lot of time for instruction, she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had to step up and figure out how to do things on my own.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an undergrad, Katie was already acting like a grad student or a postdoc,&#8221; says UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Particle Physics Tesla Jeltema. &#8220;She was running her own projects and training other students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Hellier became lab manager, where she helped supervise a total of 15 undergrad students over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UC Santa Cruz, Hellier also was instrumental in developing the Women in Physics and Astronomy group on campus. According to Jeltema, Hellier helped turn the organization into a more formal group with regular meetings, developed a website for the organization, and, in 2015, helped host a national conference for undergraduate women in physics on campus. She also was president of the organization for several years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a $3,000-a-month Department of Energy grant in hand, Hellier is now in Colorado testing a new solar-cell material that might be able to generate the high voltages needed for industry &#8212; something that isn&#8217;t feasible now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting on a bench with a view of a babbling creek and distant Rockies, Hellier says she is not only excited about the possibilities of the research she is doing but also about eventually becoming a professor and a mentor to students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to me to help (students) learn what research is about and to allow them to feel that sense of accomplishment, that sense of having achieved something,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for her, not only does science allow her to do good in the world, she says, but it also does good for her, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Before I started work in science, I was largely ruled by my feelings and emotions. I was a little bit more on the whimsical side, kind of dreaming about things and how things could be,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Physics brought a balance, in that I can focus on an area based on fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It centers me.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/katie-hellier.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/katie-hellier.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>katie-hellier.jpg</name><display-name>katie-hellier.jpg</display-name><file-size>52013</file-size><width>295</width><height>160</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>KATIE HELLIER</title><description>The physics grad student—with a fashion degree—is doing research into solar cell materials

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they are writing themselves into it, says Adriana Manago, an assistant professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz who studies how adolescents and young adults turn to social media to establish their own agency and manage their relationships with their parents and peers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the </span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most tech-savvy and connected generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> begins college this year, Manago sees this generation as technological trailblazers rather than passive consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young adults are digital pioneers,&#8221; says Manago. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is a tool they use to navigate their way to adulthood; they aren&#8217;t shying away from the responsibilities and emotions of growing up, she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of isolating young adults from their offline life, going online is an extension of it, </span><a href="https://adrianamanago.sites.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/491/2014/09/Social-Media-Friendship-Happiness.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finds Manago in a recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how millennials use Facebook. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;An important part of growing up in the digital age is learning to value self-expression,&#8221; &#160;says Manago, adding that young adults turn to social media to explore their place in the world around them. &#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media use can make adolescents feel more connected because it can provide alternative spaces and places and for identity exploration. Teens are using technology to acquire more information and support than was possible in the pre-internet era.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, LGBTQ youth in rural areas report a better understanding of who they are thanks to the support of communities they find on social media, says Manago. Also, ethnic-minority adolescents find new insights into issues of race and ethnicity from slightly older peers. Facebook can even help shy people gather information about people they would like to know better at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is just another way to connect with offline peers, Manago emphasizes. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than substituting face-to-face communication, social media is more like a bridge or scaffolding of the lives and identities of youth. &#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Appreciating cultural and generational perspectives </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today&#8217;s youth are navigating a world very different than their parents, and it&#8217;s important to remember that,&#8221; says Manago, pointing out that today&#8217;s college students are the first to experience their entire adolescence </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the advent of social networking sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly, technology and social media have altered the ways people interact with the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But all that hyperbole and criticism about kids and technology? It needs to be put into perspective, urges Manago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People put their own values and biases onto how we see reality,&#8221; Manago says of the generational and cultural lenses used to view kids and their devices. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broader political, economic, and social changes provide context for today&#8217;s youth. As </span><a href="https://www.beloit.edu/mindset/2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beliot College&#8217;s annual Mindset List</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports, this year&#8217;s matriculating college frosh have always known Donald Trump as a political figure, and a phone&#8217;s primary functions have always been message delivery, mapping, research, and games. For </span><a href="https://www.beloit.edu/mindset/previouslists/2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sophomores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the US has always been at war. </span><a href="https://www.beloit.edu/mindset/previouslists/2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juniors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just started kindergarten when the September 11 terror attacks occurred, and </span><a href="https://www.beloit.edu/mindset/previouslists/2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seniors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> never needed to go to a friend&#8217;s house to be able to study together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Youth are only adapting to this new era,&#8221; says Manago, </span><a href="http://adrianamanago.sites.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/491/2014/09/Intergenerational-Value-Change-Chiapas-MX.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whose earlier work has examined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the value changes across generations that correspond with sociocultural changes toward a market economy in southern Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Culture isn&#8217;t stationary,&#8221; adds Manago. &#8220;It&#8217;s always changing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Paradigm shifts and context collapse</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manago was in graduate school at UCLA, studying developmental psychology at the FPR-UCLA Center for Culture, Brain, and Development, when social media entered the mainstream. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was seeing culture changing all around me,&#8221; Manago remembers, recalling how MySpace&#8212;a social networking site that once surpassed Google as the most visited website in the country&#8212;became hugely popular. Facebook soon followed, along with other popular networking tools like Instagram and Snapchat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally trained as a journalist, Manago was intrigued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It felt like the perfect time to study social change as it was happening,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that stands out to Manago is a concept called &#8220;context collapse.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media has opened up the possibility of unknown and infinite audiences, including potential employers, family members, teachers, school friends, and romantic partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In face-to-face communication, there are many ways to adapt one&#8217;s presentation. But online communication doesn&#8217;t offer that adaptability. There is only one way to present oneself to a diverse group of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this context collapse, identity development can begin to resemble personal branding, as youth negotiate a public persona. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young adults show elaborate and complex considerations of their online reputation with a new type of image management that is akin to marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While social media offers many opportunities for social support and identity exploration, there are certainly problems youth must confront, including cyberbullying and increased self-consciousness. Manago has </span><a href="https://adrianamanago.sites.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/491/2014/09/Facebook-OBC-Sex-Health.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that social media use can create a heightened awareness of one&#8217;s self</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can have consequences for body image in both men and women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Youth are no longer just consumers,&#8221; says Manago, &#8220;but also media producers, co-constructing online media environments to make them more precisely relevant to their personal needs and preferences than was possible with traditional media use.&#8221; &#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e35cbf41807270177ad8b80e92f26e83"><name>transfer-strategies</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz, community colleges seek to strengthen ties</title><summary>A meeting with California higher education leaders has led to seven strategies to further strengthen ties between UC Santa Cruz and community colleges. </summary><start-date>1507014000000</start-date><display-name>Transfer students</display-name><path>/2017/10/transfer-strategies</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/transfer-strategies</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1507053058922</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1507054680011</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/higher-ed-leaders.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/higher-ed-leaders.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>higher-ed-leaders.jpg</name><display-name>higher-ed-leaders.jpg</display-name><file-size>138340</file-size><width>400</width><height>283</height></image><image-alt>Higher education leaders</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/higher-ed-leaders-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/higher-ed-leaders-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>higher-ed-leaders-80px.jpg</name><display-name>higher-ed-leaders-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>15881</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Higher education leaders</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Chancellor Debbie Budd with the&#160;San Jos&#233;-Evergreen Community College District&#160;talks with Chancellor Patrick Schmitt with the&#160;West Valley-Mission Community College District.&#160;<span>(Photo by Thuy Thi Nguyen)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/park-nguyen-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/park-nguyen-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>park-nguyen-400px.jpg</name><display-name>park-nguyen-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>165653</file-size><width>400</width><height>301</height></image><image-alt>resident Thuy Thi Nguyen with Foothill College, left, and UC Regent Lark Park.</image-alt><image-caption>President Thuy Thi Nguyen with Foothill College, left, and UC Regent Lark Park. (Photo by Thuy Thi Nguyen)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an effort to bring 1,500 new California transfer students to UC Santa Cruz by 2020 and to support the California Community Colleges in increasing their transfers to the UC and CSU by 35 percent by 2022, higher education leaders met Friday to identify a variety of action items to strengthen ties.</p>
<p>The 90-minute discussion at the UC Santa Cruz Scotts Valley Center included Chancellor George Blumenthal, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Tromp, twelve regional California Community College leaders, California Community College Deputy Chancellor Erik Skinner, and UC Regent Lark Park.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to explore and prioritize several of the ideas shared by the group that will be sustainable and have long-term impacts,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;It was a stimulating discussion that focused on the opportunities and challenges in building a strong pipeline from our community colleges to our campus.&#8221; <br/><br/>Shared ideas items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>De-mystify the University of California and the research university experience with a key message that &#8220;you belong here.&#8221;<br/>Increase intersegmental faculty-to-faculty collaboration between UCs and community colleges.</li>
<li>Seek additional input from students on how UC Santa Cruz can best help them understand all that the campus offers, if we can help them achieve their goals, and how to ensure they are prepared.</li>
<li>Launch more focused cohort programs with a particular focus on underrepresented and first-generation students e.g. a leadership program.</li>
<li>Customize and personalize recruitment with increased involvement of successful transfer students from the community colleges.<br/>Expose students to UC Santa Cruz courses with online and cross-campus enrollment and courses delivered on the community college campus.</li>
<li>Review and enhance systemwide transfer pathways and consider broader transfer admission guarantees.</li>
<li>Ensure clear and timely course articulation information for students and counselors</li>
<li>Develop long-range enrollment plans across the various systems that includes funding commitments to balance access, quality, and affordability.</li>
</ul>
<p>California Community College Deputy Chancellor Skinner observed that success will be found through strengthening the partnerships between UC Santa Cruz and community colleges in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;This conversation is about how can we take this further&#8212;how can we both increase the transfer rate and increase the success for students?&#8221; Skinner said. &#8220;At the end of the day, the real magic is in the local partnership and the local conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp noted that 46 percent of UC transfer students live within 50 miles of their home. UC Santa Cruz, in a less-dense region with many students who find it economically challenging to leave their family and work, is below this average. Commuting is not an accessible option for many students.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz expects to enroll 1,275 new California transfer students for the 2017-18 academic year, moving closer to meeting the state&#8217;s 2-to-1 goal&#8212;to have one new California transfer for every two new first-year students from California. The campus ratio is 2.7-to-1. The plan is to increase California transfer enrollments by 18 percent by 2020 in order to achieve this agreed upon level of first-year students to transfers.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is proud to continue offering a transfer admission guarantee (TAG). A UC Santa Cruz TAG is a written agreement guaranteeing fall admission to California community college students who meet specific criteria.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e3a88ddf807270177ad8b80e57e0900e"><name>founders-celebration-advance-2017</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Founders Celebration 2017: recognizing extraordinary achievement and generosity</title><summary>J.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>In 2012, when founding Oakes College provost and distinguished sociologist J. Herman Blake traveled back to UC Santa Cruz to give a presentation, his students sought him out. They wanted to thank him.</p>
<p>Though Blake left UC Santa Cruz in the 1980s, those students never forgot him. Frances Henderson, (Oakes, &#8217;80, East Asian Studies/history) remembered how Blake made her promise to return to UC Santa Cruz after she took a quarter off, in part because her father was ill. &#8220;Someone saw me crying, and he found out about it. He was very caring. As a provost he wore a mantel of power but he was very sweet and gentle.&#8221;</p>
<p>This month, Blake will be back on campus to receive one of the university&#8217;s highest honors. He will be one of three honorees at the <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/index.html">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Founders Celebration Dinner</a> at the Porter Dining Hall on Oct. 21 at 7 p.m., following a 6 p.m. reception.</p>
<p>Blake will be given the Fiat Lux Award in recognition for his many years of distinguished service. This will be a kind of homecoming for Blake, who taught at UC Santa Cruz for 18 years, gaining renown both as a professor and for his leading role in forming Oakes, the seventh college at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"When Chancellor (George) Blumenthal called me about the Fiat Lux Award, I was deeply moved,&#8221; Blake said last week. &#8220;It is an incredible honor and I am grateful to UC Santa Cruz for this consideration. It is a pinnacle for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blake is the&#8239;co-author of&#8239;<em>Revolutionary Suicide</em>,&#8239;an autobiography of Black Panther Party cofounder Huey P. Newton (Oakes &#8216;74, individual major; Ph.D. &#8216;80, history of consciousness), and many scholarly articles&#8239;on institutional excellence,&#8239;student academic achievement, and the unique Gullah Geechee culture along the Southeastern coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Blake&#8217;s standing and legacy on campus is so notable, his admirers even named an award named after him, presented to a graduate or graduates who best exemplify his commitment and service to Oakes as well as his academic achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding a successful campaign</strong></p>
<p>Fundraiser extraordinaire Linda Peterson (Stevenson, history, &#8217;70) will also receive a Fiat Lux Award for her outstanding service. Peterson, a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee and chair of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, presided over a fundraising effort that exceeded all expectations. Around the time of the campaign kickoff, she galvanized supporters with some words of wisdom: &#8220;It&#8217;s not just the right time, it&#8217;s about time. We&#8217;ve been too shy too long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout the campaign, Peterson worked hard to engage trustees and donors. The campaign was a triumph, coming to its successful end ahead of schedule and surpassing its original goals.</p>
<p>More than 60,000 donors gave $335 million, raising money for the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, the Coastal Sustainability Initiative, the Quarry Amphitheater, the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, academic divisions, the campus&#8217;s libraries, scholarships, fellowships and transformative student experience.</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing research excellence </strong></p>
<p>Carl Walsh, distinguished economics professor at UC Santa Cruz, will be on hand to receive the Faculty Research Award, the foremost academic honor bestowed by the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate. This honor is awarded annually to a faculty member who has a distinguished record in research.</p>
<p>Walsh is one of the world&#8217;s premiere researchers in the fields of monetary theory and monetary policy. His now-classic papers on central bank governance, optimal monetary policy, and inflation targeting have helped set the research agenda for monetary economists for over thirty years and have had a strong positive influence on the way the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and central banks abroad conduct monetary policy.</p>
<p>He has also written influential articles on how transparency in the conduct of monetary policy can improve economic efficiency.</p>
<p>More recently, he has integrated labor markets into monetary policy models in an elegant and insightful way. Walsh has been recognized internationally for the quality of his research and teaching. His many publications include&#160;<em>Monetary Theory and Policy,</em> required reading in most graduate courses worldwide in his field.</p>
<p>Tickets for the celebration dinner are $150 per person. Those who wish to attend may <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2772&amp;cid=4998">buy their tickets online. </a></p>
<p>The Founders Day festivities will kick off at 4 p.m. Friday, October 20 with the <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/convocation-chairs.html">Convocation of Chairs</a> at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Music Recital Hall.</p>
<p>At this special event, which is free and open to the public, the university will honor the holders of faculty chairs and the donors who created them. A major achievement of the campaign was the creation of 16 new chairs, nearly doubling the total number of endowed chairs. The convocation will honor the new as well as previous chair holders and donors.</p>

<p>"I want every student in Santa Cruz County and our state to know that a UC education is within their reach," Blumenthal said. "The University California is committed to making an education affordable and attainable for all students in our state."</p>
<p>Blumenthal will speak to approximately 300 Pajaro Valley High School students at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 25. Achieve UC will feature a welcome reception, college/resource fair, and a panel session for students to pose questions directly to the chancellor and alumni of UC Santa Cruz. College representatives will also be on hand to talk to students about applying to college, the availability of scholarships, and financial aid.</p>
<p>The University of California has one of the most comprehensive financial aid programs in the nation with 57 percent of California students receiving enough aid to completely cover their tuition and fees, and 75 percent paying less than the standard sticker price.</p>
<p>Students often are unaware of the range of resources available to make college affordable for all Californians. UC's Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan, for instance, covers the full cost of tuition for students whose families earn $80,000 a year or less. More than half of UC undergraduates who are California residents pay no tuition thanks to the Blue and Gold Plan and other grants and scholarships.</p>
<p>Blumenthal will promote the community college transfer pathways to UC Santa Cruz and the campus commitment to admit any transfer student who meets the terms of the academic contract and applies to UC Santa Cruz while applications are being accepted. By taking advantage of the campus&#8217;s Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG), students also receive an early review of academic records, early admission notification, and specific guidance about major preparation and general education coursework. Transfer agreements like TAG have helped ensure that 93 percent of transfer admits are from local California Community Colleges.</p>
<p>Students are often surprised to learn how many from their school who apply to UC get in&#8212;3 out of every 5 students that apply to UC are admitted.</p>
<p>Initiatives like Achieve UC are helping to broadcast this message statewide, with the aim of encouraging more students to pursue their postsecondary dreams, goals, and aspirations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ed6a6597807270177ad8b80e446acc36"><name>policy-review-field-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus review of the draft Field Research Safety Policy OR-0001</title><summary>The Office of Research is proposing a new policy that addresses research safety in the field.&#13;

<p>&#160;</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>University researchers partnered with community organizations to survey 1,700 renters across county; overcrowding and maintenance are issues, too

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Nearly 70 percent of renters surveyed in Santa Cruz County experience "rent burden," defined as spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities, according to preliminary results of a survey of 1,700 renters across the county conducted by UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The survey also found that one in four renters devote a shocking 70 percent of their income to rent and utilities.</p>
<p>"This means only one-third of the people we talked to could be considered to be getting by," said Steve McKay, associate professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz, who co-led the project with Sociology Professor Miriam Greenberg. "Housing is the number-one issue in Santa Cruz County, and we have to find ways to relieve the burden renters are experiencing."</p>
<p>Renters also face significant challenges with overcrowding, evictions and forced moves, and major maintenance, the survey revealed. Additional findings include:</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160;&#8226; 27 percent of respondents experience overcrowding, with more than two people occupying a bedroom&#8212;a finding much higher than official statistics, McKay noted.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160;&#8226; Of renters who moved in the last five years, 50 percent said the move was "forced or involuntary," most often due to eviction or a rent increase.</p>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160;&#8226; 57 percent said they had experienced at least one major problem with their rental, with maintenance and overall condition of the unit the most commonly cited problems.</p>
<p>McKay, Greenberg and their team will present their results during a <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu/event/no-place-like-home-2/?utm_source=Fall+2017+Highlights&amp;utm_campaign=Fall+2017+Highlights&amp;utm_medium=email">free public event</a> on Thursday, October 19, at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event, which kicks off <a href="http://scchousingadvocacynetwork.com/affordable-housing-week/">Affordable Housing Week</a>, begins at 7 p.m.; Spanish translation will be provided. Co-sponsored by the City of Santa Cruz, the event also features a visual and literary art exhibit on the meaning of "home."</p>
<p>The study, "<a href="http://noplacelikehomeucsc.org/en/">No Place Like Home: The Santa Cruz County Affordable Housing Crisis Report</a>," was produced in collaboration with the Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County and Community Bridges, with financial support from the UC Humanities Research Institute, the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Humanities Research, the UCSC Division of Student Success, and the UC Office of the President, and others.</p>
<p>The findings build on results of an <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/no-place-like-home.html">earlier survey</a> McKay and Greenberg conducted of nearly 500 residents of the Beach Flats and Lower Ocean neighborhoods in Santa Cruz that documented similar levels of financial hardship.</p>
<p>In the latest installment, students reached out to renters in four additional neighborhoods&#8212;Live Oak, Watsonville, the Westside, and Downtown Santa Cruz&#8212;to talk with them about their experiences. Respondents were asked about rent, overcrowding, evictions and forced moves, and problems with maintenance, among other issues.</p>
<p>"By talking with 1,700 people, we are able to tell an important story that captures the experience of renters across our county," said McKay. "The story is sadly consistent, and these results underscore the need to address the housing crisis in our community."</p>
<p>The research is the product of a new model of "community-initiated student engaged research" being pioneered by McKay and Greenberg, who have worked with more than 200 UC Santa Cruz undergraduates since February 2016, many of whom are native Spanish speakers. This spring, McKay taught a new class in research methodologies, and students then administered surveys, traversing the county in bilingual pairs, knocking on doors and asking residents to spend 20-30 minutes responding to survey questions.</p>
<p>Respondents were offered $10 Safeway gift cards as an incentive, and all were offered a pamphlet explaining their rights as renters, whether they participated in the survey or not. Responses were collected on computer tablets, which allowed for rapid data analysis, said McKay. In addition, about 75 respondents participated in in-depth, follow-up interviews, some of which were edited into "digital stories" that will be debuted at the event.</p>
<p>"The students loved it," said McKay. "They came alive out in the field." For native Spanish speakers, many of who have been told they are deficient because they aren't native English speakers, the experience was particularly empowering, he said.</p>
<p>"Latinos, particularly non-English speakers, are perpetually undercounted and underrepresented in survey research, but we were able to reach them because our students could speak to them," said McKay. "These students became the most important asset in the research. They were bringing skills I don't have, and they are creating better research because of it."</p>
<p>McKay's students were also able to connect with vulnerable populations, including undocumented immigrants, who might otherwise be wary of survey research. "Many of our students are vulnerable themselves, so they could make a connection with the people they were interviewing," he said.</p>
<p>Community partners contributed to the success of the survey effort, said McKay.</p>
<p>"Respondents were more likely to open up, because we were working with community organizations they trust," he noted. Students attended events and got to know the clientele and staff of the Community Bridges' Resource Centers and the Community Action Board's Day Worker Center. They distributed flyers about the survey, and community leaders encouraged residents to participate.</p>
<p>Financial support from the UC Office of the President funded spring and summer research internships for participating students, who were paid $15 per hour, working 20 hours per week; that support enabled low-income students to participate in the research opportunity, noted McKay.</p>
<p>"We're trying to build this model of community-initiated, student-engaged research," said McKay. "This is one of the most fulfilling things I've done as an academic. It's what research at a public university should look like."</p>
<p>McKay and Greenberg worked with undergraduate teams of about 10 students, each of which focused on a particular area: field surveys and interviews; data analysis; expert interviews; background and policy research; digital mapping; digital storytelling; web design; art and literary production; events; and outreach.</p>
<p>"It's been an amazing opportunity to be part of this project," said Hermes Padilla, a senior Community Studies major who administered surveys, conducted in-depth follow-up interviews, and is now helping with data analysis. "It definitely changed my whole educational and career goals."</p>
<p>Talking with renters was eye opening, said Padilla, who learned of hardship that is "way harsher" than what renters experience in his hometown of Los Angeles. He was also struck by the gratitude of Watsonville residents, who appreciated his willingness to come to South County to speak to them in Spanish about their experiences.</p>
<p>"They thanked me for asking them about their experiences, and they thanked me for getting educated, like it was empowering for the community as a whole," said Padilla, who plans to build on the experience by doing a six-month field study of displaced homeless people in Latin America.</p>
<p>"No Place Like Home" is a sweeping, ongoing, interdisciplinary project. In Greenberg's classes, students researched the historic roots and impacts of affordable housing crises.

<div>
<ul>
<li>December 25, 26, 29 and January 1 are paid university holidays (if eligibility criteria are met)&#160;</li>
<li>December 27 and 28 are curtailment days</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Please note</strong>: The winter holidays and closure dates were changed after the Academic and Administrative calendar was published. Please refer to the revised calendar for correct dates <a href="https://registrar.ucsc.edu/calendar/academiccalendar.html">https://registrar.ucsc.edu/calendar/academiccalendar.html</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Employees may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off (CTO), or leave without pay (LWOP) for December 27 and 28, 2017, curtailment days. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation hours, up to two (2) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accrual during the campus curtailment period. In addition, those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their accrued vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed.&#160;&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus curtailment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Campus Closure" memo that will be forthcoming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas. It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Unit heads should also notify their appropriate Staff HR Representative for time and payroll accounting purposes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Biweekly employees not enrolled in Direct Deposit can pick up their 12/27/17 paychecks at The Scotts Valley Center, located at 100 Enterprise Way, from 9am - 10am on Wednesday, 12/27/17. A valid picture ID must be presented when picking up the paycheck. Paychecks not picked up on 12/27/17 will be delivered to the campus unit designated as the employee&#8217;s mail stop in the Payroll Personnel System no later than Wednesday, 1/3/18. Checks will generally not be available for pick-up on 1/2/18 because they will be in transit to Mail Services for delivery processing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Information on Direct Deposit, including directions on how to enroll, is <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Payroll_Direct_Deposit.aspx">available online</a>.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Frequently asked questions regarding the campus curtailment and time reporting for staff employees <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/procedures/curtailment/winter-curtailment-qa-2017-2018.pdf">may be read online.</a></div>

<div>Para: Academicos y empleados de UC Santa Cruz&#160;</div>
<div>De parte de: Grace McClintock, Assistant Vice Provost, Personal Academico&#160;</div>
<div>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Steve Stein, Associate Vice Chancellor, Recursos Humanos&#160;</div>
<div>Sobre: Acortamiento del invierno del campus 2016-2017</div>
<div></div>
<div>El receso de invierno del campus para el periodo 2017-2018 est&#225; programado desde el s&#225;bado, 23 de diciembre de 2017, hasta el lunes, 1 de enero de 2018:</div>
<div>&#8226;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Los d&#237;as 25, 26 y 29 de diciembre de 2017 y el 1 de enero de 2018 son d&#237;as de descanso pagados en la universidad (si se cumple con los criterios de elegibilidad).&#160;</div>
<div>&#8226;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>El 27 y 28 de diciembre de 2017 son d&#237;as de receso.</div>
<div>Tome nota: los d&#237;as feriados y fechas de cierre de invierno se cambiaron despu&#233;s de que se public&#243; el calendario acad&#233;mico y administrativo. Consulte el calendario revisado para obtener las fechas correctas</div>
<div><a href="https://registrar.ucsc.edu/calendar/academiccalendar.html">https://registrar.ucsc.edu/calendar/academiccalendar.html</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Para estos dos d&#237;as de receso, los empleados pueden solicitar vacaciones, utilizar tiempo libre compensatorio acumulado (compensatory time off, CTO) o tomarlos como permiso sin sueldo (leave without pay, LWOP). Los empleados que no tengan suficientes horas de vacaciones acumuladas, pueden utilizar por adelantado hasta dos (2) d&#237;as de permiso para vacaciones durante el periodo de receso del campus. Adem&#225;s, aquellos empleados que normalmente deban esperar seis (6) meses antes de utilizar sus vacaciones acumuladas, podr&#225;n utilizar sus horas de vacaciones acumuladas aun si el periodo de espera no se ha completado.&#160;&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Considerando las distintas responsabilidades del personal acad&#233;mico y la flexibilidad para el cumplimiento de sus obligaciones, se anticipa que parte del personal acad&#233;mico continuar&#225; trabajando durante el receso del campus.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Las unidades que planeen continuar con las operaciones normales durante el receso del campus tienen que recibir la aprobaci&#243;n de la oficina de rector&#237;a o de la autoridad correspondiente y deber&#225;n consultar el memorando &#8220;Excepciones por el cierre del campus&#8221; que el &#225;rea de Infraestructura F&#237;sica enviar&#225; pr&#243;ximamente. En este memorando se explicar&#225; el procedimiento necesario para garantizar el suministro de calefacci&#243;n para las &#225;reas de trabajo adecuadas. Sin embargo, es importante indicar que se reducir&#225; la temperatura del edificio en &#225;reas que generalmente se utilizan muy poco. Por lo tanto, recomi&#233;ndele al personal vestir ropa adecuada durante esos d&#237;as. Los oficiales o Administradores Principales de unidades tambi&#233;n deber&#225;n comunicarse con sus representantes de Recursos Humanos correspondientes para fines del c&#225;lculo de horarios y n&#243;mina.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Los empleados que trabajen por quincena y que no est&#233;n inscritos en el sistema de dep&#243;sitos directos pueden recoger sus cheques de pago el 27/12/2017 en The Scotts Valley Center, localizado en 100 Enterprise Way, de 9:00 a. m. a 10:00 a. m., el mi&#233;rcoles 27/12/2017. Es obligatorio presentar un documento vigente de identificaci&#243;n con fotograf&#237;a para recibir el cheque de pago. Los cheques que no se recojan el 27/12/2017 se enviar&#225;n al campus designado que el Sistema de N&#243;mina muestre como la direcci&#243;n laboral del empleado, a m&#225;s tardar el mi&#233;rcoles, 3 de enero de 2018. Por lo general, los cheques no estar&#225;n disponibles para recogerlos el 2/01/2018 pues estar&#225;n siendo entregados al servicio de correo para su env&#237;o correspondiente.</div>
<div></div>
<div>La informaci&#243;n sobre los dep&#243;sitos directos, incluyendo las instrucciones sobre c&#243;mo inscribirse, est&#225; <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Payroll_Direct_Deposit.aspx">disponible en l&#237;nea</a>.&#160;</div>

<div></div>
<div>Recommendations if going to the beach:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Remain away from and out of the water during this swell event</li>
<li>Always keep your eyes on the ocean&#160;</li>
<li>Remain farther back from the water's edge and off of rocks and jetties.</li>
<li>If an area is wet, assume another wave will be at that location again</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t go in after pets that have been swept into the sea, most pets will make it out of the water on their own</li>
</ul>

<p>Curated by the campus&#8217;s award-winning author and literature professor Karen Tei Yamashita, the series runs through December 7 at the Humanities Lecture Hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a very exciting series with an amazing line up of artists, filmmakers, poets, and writers,&#8221; said Yamashita. &#8220;Their work brings insight and understanding about histories of war and refuge, and creatively provides spaces of reconciliation, social justice, and hope--a place beyond walls.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The title, &#8216;Beyond the Wall:&#160; War, Refuge, and Home,&#8217; pushes against the idea that we can build walls to keep others out or in, or to keep our borders safe,&#8221; Yamashita added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are complicit with a long history of war and economic distress making refuge, exile, migration, and loss of home for many a necessary and cruel reality. Perhaps we are not always aware of it, but over time we&#8217;ve come to live among friends and family and neighbors who know intimately the trauma of these histories.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Highlights of the series include readings by <strong>Viet Thanh Nguyen</strong>, whose novel, <em>The Sympathizer</em>, which retraced the events of the war in Vietnam and its aftermath, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; and <strong>Ngugi Wa Thiong&#8217;o</strong>, an exiled Kenyan novelist and theorist of postcolonial literature who is internationally known for his many books of fiction, memoir, and critical thought.</p>
<p><strong>Toni Jensen</strong>, author of the short story collection, <em>From the Hilltop</em>, will also be participating in the series. Jensen is currently working on a new fiction collection about fracking and sex trafficking of Indigenous women. And <strong>Renee Tajima-Pe&#241;a</strong>, whose documentary film, <em>No M&#225;s B&#233;bes,</em> is about immigrant women sterilized after going into labor, will be returning to UC Santa Cruz to talk about her work.</p>
<p><strong>James Janko</strong>, a novelist whose writing began in a veterans writing group founded by Maxine Hong Kingston, will additionally be in conversation with Ellen Greenblatt, a long-time co-facilitator of these workshops.</p>
<p>The goal of the Living Writers Series is to bring visiting authors and poets to UC Santa Cruz in order to provide students with an in-depth look into the world of the working writer. &#160;</p>
<p>All of the readings take place at the Humanities Lecture Hall, 206, on Thursdays from 5:20 to 6 p.m. The series is open to the public and admission is free.</p>
<p>The upcoming lineup:</p>
<p>&#160;<strong>October 12</strong>: Ng&#361;g&#297; wa Thiong'o</p>
<p><strong>October 19</strong>:&#160;Viet Thanh Nguyen (at 7:10 pm)</p>

From research to purchasing, we seek to minimize our environmental footprint. Our latest Campus Sustainability Plan will ensure we go even further.</p>
<p>I am excited to invite everyone in our campus community to the Campus Sustainability Plan kick-off event on Thursday, Oct. 19 from 2&#8211;4:30 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. Please register to attend&#160;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegLbqY70Kw6WWP40wJw37lJCePuwgEuEbf7djooqxoUg1GWA/viewform">online</a>. We will unveil our 5-year Campus Sustainability Plan and share funding resources for staff, faculty, and student sustainability projects. Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham will deliver some brief remarks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/governance/plans-reports/campus-sust-plan/index.html">Campus Sustainability Plan</a> is the result of hard work from several committees, made up of faculty, staff, and students, that looked at how we can advance sustainability in every part of our university. Last spring, we invited everyone on campus to weigh in on the draft plan. The feedback was exceptional and insightful.</p>
<p>Our new plan focuses on four areas:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning &amp; Culture</li>
<li>Materials Management &amp; Food Systems</li>
<li>Natural Environment &amp; Infrastructure</li>
<li>Climate &amp; Energy</li>
</ul>
<p>Each area includes specific goals, strategies, and first-year actions to help move us forward. The plan also acknowledges that concern for the environment intersects with social issues.</p>
<p>We want to build on our existing policies and programs, and strengthen the ties between operations and research.</p>
<p>The plan is ambitious and calls on us to make big steps forward: How can we achieve net zero emissions for all new capital projects? How do we achieve and maintain zero waste by 2020? How do we significantly reduce our use of potable water?</p>
<p>I know there's will across campus to be more sustainable. And thanks to everyone's help, our Campus Sustainability Plan will guide the way.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="036c5002807270177ad8b80e12653c76"><name>lick-observatory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lick Observatory hosts Latino students and parents for night of astronomy</title><summary>An evening event for high school students and their family members, called La Noche de las Estrellas, was the observatory's first Spanish-language event.</summary><keywords>Lick Observatory, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Ana Rodarte, Yuliana Ortega</keywords><start-date>1507647600000</start-date><display-name>Lick Observatory hosts Latino students and parents for night of astronomy</display-name><path>/2017/10/lick-observatory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/lick-observatory</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1507590949889</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1507820896938</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><br/><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7RW5MRTRxU" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/refractor-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/refractor-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>refractor-410.jpg</name><display-name>refractor-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>111446</file-size><width>410</width><height>318</height></image><image-alt>telescope inside dome</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/display-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/display-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>display-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>display-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26566</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>students pointing at hallway display</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Viewing the stars through Lick Observatory's historic 36-inch Refractor Telescope was a highlight of the evening for many students during a visit to Lick Observatory organized by UCSC astronomers.

They were invited along with parents and other family members as part of an effort by Lick Observatory and UC Santa Cruz to reach out to Spanish-speaking communities and encourage student interest in the sciences.</p>
<p>"One of our goals is to inspire young people in these communities to get interested in science," said Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "It was important to include their families in this event so they understand that there are opportunities for their kids in science. We talked about the importance of college and tried to make sure they know that this university welcomes them and values their culture."</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz was among the speakers at La Noche de las Estrellas, Lick Observatory's first event with presentations in Spanish, which took place on Friday, September 29. He entranced the students with the story of the cosmic origins of gold. (On follow-up questionnaires, Ramirez-Ruiz was the overwhelming choice for the person students would most like to see again and spend more time with.)</p>
<p>The event was organized by UCSC astronomers Sandra Faber and David Koo, who provided funding for it through a research grant from the National Science Foundation. They and several other UCSC astronomers, including UC Observatories director Claire Max, were on hand to interact with the visiting students and their parents.</p>
<p><strong>MESA Program</strong></p>
<p>Faber and Koo worked with UCSC's Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Program to connect with teachers and students in high schools where MESA supports educational enrichment programs. Throughout the evening, participants toured the observatory in small groups, learning about the telescopes and engaging in a variety of activities, including observing with amateur astronomer telescopes as well as with Lick Observatory's 36-inch Refractor and 40-inch Nickel Telescopes.</p>
<p>"When I looked at the moon, I felt a little spark go inside of me," said Monserrat Soto, a student from Alisal High School in Salinas. "We've all seen the moon, but seeing it in a telescope is a whole different perspective."</p>
<p>Bilingual UC Santa Cruz students served as tour guides for students and parents. "They had to be comfortable translating, because we felt it was really important to engage with the parents at this event," said Yulianna Ortega, director of STEM Diversity Programs, who recruited the guides. "They're mostly seniors who have been doing undergraduate research in the sciences, and giving back to their community is important to them."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Future events</strong></p>
<p>In addition to having presentations in Spanish and translators for the small-group activities, organizers had observatory signs and videos translated into Spanish. Faber said they will be offering the same program again next year with funding from the NSF grant. "We plan to do more outreach to Spanish-speaking communities and offer more of these kinds of events in the future at Lick Observatory, so this is a good start," Faber said.</p>
<p>"We want to demonstrate our interest in the talent that is in their community," added Ramirez-Ruiz. "These are talented students who were invited, and we want them to know that they belong and that we want them here at UC Santa Cruz. We are constantly seeking the best talent, and it's important for us to reach out to those who might not see themselves as scientists or be aware of the opportunities."</p>
<p>In preparation for La Noche de las Estrellas, graduate students in the astronomy program at UC Santa Cruz brought telescopes and other demonstrations to the participating high schools to introduce the students to some basic concepts in astronomy, including how telescopes work.</p>
<p>"MESA did a great job organizing all this, and the students were enthusiastic and full of questions," said graduate student Asher Wasserman. "They were very inquisitive and curious."</p>
<p>MESA academic coordinator Ana Rodarte said they are already getting requests for more events like this. "The students were not expecting the treat they got," she said. "It's great that we're going to have another opportunity to offer this event."</p>
<p>Ambassador Mauricio Toussaint and others from the Mexican Consulate in San Jose attended the event, along with officials from the UC Office of the President and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Jesus Gonzales, director of the Institute of Astronomy at UNAM (and a former student of Faber's who earned his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz), gave a talk on the history of astronomy, from the Mayans to recent research. The event took place the day after a signing ceremony on the UCSC campus establishing a student exchange program between UC Santa Cruz and UNAM.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/lick-observatory-espanol.html</url><title>El observatorio de Lick fue anfitrión de una noche de astronomía para estudiantes y padres latinos</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0725b852807270177ad8b80ede922b83"><name>faculty-insight-bettina</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Free speech!

The FSM coalition spanned the political spectrum at the time from the Young Republicans to the Young Socialists, to communists, to students variously affiliated with civil rights, religious, and environmental groups. As a result the Regents of the University of California revised their regulations that had previously banned communists and &#8220;controversial speakers&#8221; from visiting the campus, and prevented students from holding rallies, distributing literature, and posting fliers.</p>
<p>The Regents affirmed that henceforth their regulations would not go beyond the purview of the First and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution. Only the time, place, and manner of speech would be subject to regulation so as not to disrupt classes or the flow of pedestrian traffic and so forth. Registered student organizations, departments and so on needed only to request permits for their events in a timely manner. This movement effectively marked the end of the last remnants of the &#8220;McCarthy period&#8221; in which scores of faculty had been fired for refusing to sign &#8220;loyalty oaths,&#8221; and in which hundreds and thousands of folks across the country had lost their jobs and been blacklisted. From this point of view, historians generally mark FSM as a kind of watershed in re-establishing democratic traditions and First Amendment rights in the country.</p>
<p>FSM is also often cited as the first mass movement of what became the New Left, riding on the strength of the black-led civil rights movement that climaxed with the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. FSM was credited with inaugurating northern student protests against the Vietnam War. For these reasons, among others, Berkeley emerged as an iconic symbol of radical and liberal politics.</p>
<p>Within weeks of the inauguration of Donald Trump, therefore, it is not at all surprising that the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; led by Milo Yiannopoulos determined to hijack the issue of &#8220;free speech.&#8221; Acting on invitations from a rightist student organization, he and Ann Coulter tried to speak on campus in February 2017. While hundreds and hundreds of students assembled to peacefully protest their presence because of their racist, homophobic, anti-Muslim, and anti-Semitic hate speech, a smaller group known as antifa&#8212;shorthand for anti-fascist&#8212;engaged in disruptive street actions that shut the events down altogether because the university felt it could not &#8220;guarantee their safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Yiannopolous was widely denounced and forced to resign his position as a senior editor of Breitbart News when he condoned and seemed to advocate the legitimacy of sexual relations between 13-year-old boys and adult men and women. The Conservative Political Action Conference cancelled an invitation for him to speak, and Simon and Schuster publishers cancelled their book contract with him. Neither Yiannopolous nor anyone else accused the Conservative Political Action Conference or Simon and Schuster of infringing on his rights of free speech. Presumably, however, UC Berkeley, as both a public university and an iconic symbol, falls under a different standard.</p>
<p>In August, Yiannopolous announced that he was coming back to UC Berkeley under auspices of a student group called Berkeley Patriots. And as provocatively as possible, garnering considerable press, announced that many others from the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; would join him including Coulter, Ben Shapiro, and Steve Bannon, lately of the White House, for what he called a &#8220;Free Speech Week.&#8221; He also declared that he was going to award Coulter the first Mario Savio Free Speech Award (Savio led the FSM in 1964). At the same time, and with the same kind of deliberate and provocative bravado, he proclaimed that, &#8220;Mario Savio Is Dead.&#8221; For those of us who knew and loved Mario, including his widow, Lynne Hollander, these were particularly vicious statements. Buttons appeared on the campus a few days later, in the blue and white colors of FSM that proclaimed, &#8220;Mario Lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this uproar, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ said the campus would provide whatever security was necessary to guarantee the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; their right of free speech. In the end the campus spent more than $800,000 for &#8220;security.&#8221; Whether or not this was necessary, one can see that the real purpose of the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; was to attack the integrity of the university itself under the guise of free speech.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a considerable number of Berkeley faculty called upon the administration to ban the &#8220;alt-right,&#8221; citing, with considerable credibility, their hate-filled, racist and trans-phobic speech. Progressive students meanwhile, with tremendous effort and keen political acuity, put together a coalition of more than 30 student organizations. They, in fact, held a rally of hundreds from noon to 2 p.m. on Crescent Lawn against white supremacy and to &#8220;Defend Our Campus/Reclaim Free Speech&#8221; on Sept. 25. At the same time, press reported that 25-30 people attended a speech by Yiannopolous on Sproul Hall Plaza that was not sponsored by anyone, and therefore had no sound amplification. The student group, Berkeley Patriots, had withdrawn its invitation. There was no Free Speech Week, and the speakers announced as part of it had either never heard of it, or had declined the invitation (except for Shapiro, a Brietbart writer, and a lawyer). Over the next couple of days, the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; held impromptu rallies with a handful of people, marched to People&#8217;s Park, and back to the campus, and three anti-fascist organizers, including Yvette Felarca, a veteran of the anti-racist group BAMN (By Any Means Necessary) were arrested on misdemeanor charges. And an &#8220;alt-right&#8221; provocateur was arrested on felony charges for carrying an illegal weapon, a leaded stick.</p>
<p>I have carefully rehearsed this sequence of events, and placed them in the context of the legacy of the Free Speech Movement in order to demonstrate as clearly as possible that the alt-right hijacked the issue of free speech, about which they know nothing, and could care less, as a huge distraction. Their aim seemed to be to attack the university itself, embarrass progressives, and garner as much publicity as they could while essentially engaging in a provocative, hate-filled, racist bluff. As in Boston, when they tried a similar tactic in early summer, their non-events were dwarfed by the hundreds and thousands of people, of all hues, ethnicities, genders and political persuasions, who came out to affirm an anti-racist, pro-immigration, pro-gay free speech agenda.</p>
<p>In my view this is how to deal with the alt-right and their ilk. Dwarf their events with non-violent mass movements of unprecedented size and inspired coalition.</p>
<p>I believe we must affirm and protect the First and 14th amendments to the Constitution with everything we have. Under these amendments all the rights we have won, however contested they may be now, from the civil rights laws, to voting rights, to affirmative action, to gay rights, to reproductive rights and many more are under the aegis of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>And our right and ability to organize, assemble, protest, publish, and freely practice religion are protected by the First Amendment. The alt-right, and Trump ideologues, the neo-Nazis and Klan surrogates would have us fall into a trap to limit the purview of protections. Once limited it will be the progressive and radical movements, the anti-racist, and pro-immigration movements, the gay and lesbian and transgender movements that will be its first victims. Even while these amendments are still intact the U.S. Supreme Court, in its new fall 2017 session, is deluged with legal efforts to further gut even the limited protections of civil and human rights that have been won.</p>
<p>Hold firm to the First and 14th. With warmth and strength.<br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="074d1814807270177ad8b80e9b63761b"><name>fire-support</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supporting those affected by the North Bay fires </title><summary>We encourage anyone in our campus community impacted by these fires to reach out for support. &#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Dream expert G. William Domhoff, a distinguished professor emeritus and a research professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, has spent decades chasing the riddle of dreams and their meaning.</p>
<p>Now, with the publication of his new book <em>The Emergence of Dreaming: Mind-Wandering, Embodied Simulation, and the Default Network </em>(Oxford University Press), Domhoff presents an integrated neurocognitive theory of dreams that is grounded in the similarities between dreaming and drifting waking thought.</p>
<p>"Dreaming isn't tied to any one brain state," said Domhoff. "The issue is the level of brain activation. Dreams are imaginative but largely realistic simulations of waking life."</p>
<p>After more than 50 years of close, empirical study of dreams and dream research, Domhoff, 81, concludes that dreaming likely serves no adaptive function in an evolutionary sense.</p>
<p>"The best way to think about our capacity to dream is that it's an accidental byproduct of our waking cognitive abilities," said Domhoff. "Humans have invented uses for dreams in religious and healing rituals, which speaks to how central they are to human experience. But in an evolutionary sense, they don't serve a purpose."</p>
<p>Domhoff's theory addresses many of the persistent mysteries of dreaming, including the preponderance of deeply personal subject matter in dreams, as well as developmental aspects of dreaming, and it provides the neurocognitive link between dreaming and "mind wandering," or daydreaming.</p>
<p>Dreams originate in the same parts of the brain now known to be most active during mind wandering, according to Domhoff. Called the "default network," these areas become more dense and integrated between the ages of 8-15, when dreaming also becomes more frequent and dreams become more complex.</p>
<p>The transition to dreaming occurs in stages as we stop paying attention to the external world, according to Domhoff, whose theory integrates insights from neuroimaging studies of brain activity and the discovery of the "mind-wandering" network. First, the externally focused "central executive network" of the brain deactivates. Second, the attentional networks tamp down, including the vigilant salience network that is always poised to send "red alerts." Finally, as sensory networks screen out stimulation, imagery networks become stronger, and the mind begins to wander intensely.</p>
<p>"It's like a symphony. It's very harmonious," said Domhoff. "As one network deactivates, and then another, the default network begins to ascend, just like when the strings come up or the horns begin to blare. When the default network is free to roam, that's when we dream."</p>
<p>Humans spend 20 to 30 percent of their waking hours in this mind-drifting state, said Domhoff. Neurophysiologically, it's the same process that occurs during sleep, when sleep-inducing neurochemicals provide an additional boost.</p>
<p>Awake or asleep, as the default network ascends, the power of the brain's imagery network transitions us from mind wandering to what researchers call "embodied simulation," during which vivid imagery can make dreamers feel a part of the action.</p>
<p>"That&#8217;s what makes dreams feel so real," said Domhoff. "It's the same with daydreaming. Sometimes you can just <em>feel </em>it. The sense of being an embodied participant is what distinguishes dreaming from other forms of thought."</p>
<p>During sleep, brain activation fluctuates up and down throughout the night. Arousal increases as morning approaches, and so does mind wandering or dreaming, according to numerous laboratory studies. Dreams are highly personal because the default network includes a big part of the "self network," added Domhoff.</p>
<p>"We don't dream about politics or religion or economics," said Domhoff, whose previous books include <em>The Scientific Study of Dreams</em>, <em>Finding Meaning in Dreams: A Quantitative Approach</em>, and <em>The Mystique of Dreams</em>. "All around the world, dreams are dominated by personal concerns. More than 70 percent of dreams are personal&#8212;typically dramatized enactments of significant personal concerns about the past, present, and future."</p>
<p>The frequency of a given topic reflects the intensity of that concern in the dreamer's life, said Domhoff.</p>
<p>"Dreams are generated by this network with a strong self-network within it, coupled with the powerful imagery network," he said. "It's imagination run wild."</p>
<p>Studies show that children don't dream often or with much complexity until they reach the ages of 9-11, said Domhoff, noting that some apparent nightmares in young children happen during "sleep terrors" that aren't dreams, or during awakening. "We only gradually develop the mental imagery, imagination, and ability to tell a story," he said. "The capacity to dream is linked to cognitive and brain development."</p>
<p>Domhoff began studying dreams as a graduate student with his mentor Calvin Hall, a pioneering dream researcher. For many years, he conducted quantitative studies of dream content.</p>
<p>"Gradually, my motivation changed from wanting to understand people through dreams to wanting to develop a really good theory of dreams," said Domhoff, who took advantage of a university early-retirement incentive program in 1994. Stepping away from the day-to-day obligations of teaching and campus service at the age of 57 freed him to focus his full attention to dreams. "These have been the greatest intellectual years of my life," he said.</p>
<p>Today, Domhoff's hope is that his neurocognitive theory will be seen as "one piece of the puzzle of any really good theory of the mind. I want this to be the dream piece."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH6xpzdbnL0&amp;feature=youtu.be</url><title>Bill Domhoff's recent lecture, "Seven Surprising Discoveries That Changed My Thinking About Dreams." </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="07de79b9807270177ad8b80e098966f0"><name>earthquake-preparedness</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Earthquake drill, CruzAlert planned for Thursday, Oct. 19</title><summary>All UC Santa Cruz CruzAlert registrants will receive a CruzAlert notification at 10:19 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 19 as part of earthquake preparedness for the Great Shakeout.</summary><start-date>1507618800000</start-date><display-name>Emergency preparedness</display-name><path>/2017/10/earthquake-preparedness</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/earthquake-preparedness</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1507665540561</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1508257977203</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/stop-drop.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/stop-drop.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stop-drop.jpg</name><display-name>stop-drop.jpg</display-name><file-size>70723</file-size><width>392</width><height>129</height></image><image-alt>Earthquake preparedness</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Monday's (Oct. 9) 4.1&#160;tremor&#160;is a reminder that we should always be prepared for an earthquake.&#160;</p>

<p>The iconic venue&#8212;which has been a stage for legends&#160;such as C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, Angela Davis, Buckminster Fuller, Joan Baez and more&#8212;has been restored and reopened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is with great pride that the Dean of Students Office stewards the Quarry Amphitheater into the next phase of its history and the history of the campus,&#8221; said interim Dean of Students Lucy Rojas. &#8220;We plan to exercise great care in maintaining the Quarry Amphitheater for its bright future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus community is invited to celebrate its re-opening at noon on Thursday, Oct. 19 (<a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2790&amp;cid=5035">RSVP</a>), and the local community is invited to see it as part of <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/day-events-tours.html">Founders Celebration</a> from 2&#8211;4 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 21.</p>
<p>The Quarry restoration is one of the many successes of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which raised more than $335 million to move the campus forward.</p>
<p>Despite the Quarry Amphitheater's central role in campus life since its opening in 1967, the venue fell into disrepair. As a result, events were discontinued beginning n 2006 leaving a void in the heart of campus.</p>
<p>The $8 million project was largely supported by the Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC), which recommended that $6.4 million in student fee reserves be allocated to move the effort forward. Alumni, faculty, staff, students, and donors also pitched in to get the project completed.</p>
<p>"It is important, especially with the 10 college system, to have one space where students can come together,&#8221; said Suini Torres, chair of SFAC. &#8220;With limited spaces for large-scale events and no central meeting space, it can be difficult to engage with many students at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the Quarry Amphitheater can promote unity and boost the campus climate. Especially during a time where it feels as if we are divided, this is a space where students can come together to celebrate and engage in their community here at UCSC."</p>
<p>The venue will be managed by the Dean of Students Office, which is hoping to create a vibrant gathering place for students to produce programs and events, as well as gather informally with friends. The Dean of Students Office will also produce concerts and other programs for students.</p>
<p>The campus broke ground on the restoration in November 2016 and crews have been hard at work bringing the Quarry back to its former glory and up to modern standards.</p>
<p>Carved from a former working quarry amidst redwoods and rocky outcroppings, the amphitheater dramatically showcases the deep connection between the campus, its history, and the natural landscape. Designed in the early &#8217;60s by modernist landscape architect Robert Royston, its asymmetrical terraces and sunny park-like character highlight the surroundings.</p>
<p>While some features are upgraded, one has returned to its original state&#8212;&#8220;the rock,&#8221; an outcropping that dramatically pierces the stage.</p>
<p>The project focused on restoration and new enhancements. It provided improvements to accessibility, building code, life safety, and basic operational upgrades to support performances, events and casual daily use of the venue.</p>
<p>Additionally, seating has been expanded from 1,636 to 2,000; stairs, ramps, handrails, lighting, and overall access is improved and provisions made for portable infrastructure to support events.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Music Festival</em></strong>, October 25-29, at the Music Center Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>Five free public concerts of traditional music and 40 world premieres will be offered, featuring the 55-member <strong>Creative Traditional Orchestra of the Korean National Gugak Center</strong>, the Center's <strong>Chamber Ensemble</strong>, the <strong>Borromeo String Quartet</strong>, the <strong>New York New Music Ensemble</strong>, and <strong>Festival Ensemble Korea</strong></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s festival features a special collaboration between the UC Santa Cruz Music Department and the Creative Traditional Orchestra of the National Gugak Center of Korea (NGC). The word &#8220;gugak&#8221; translates as &#8220;national music,&#8221; and the NGC orchestra is responsible for preserving ancient musical traditions, as well as developing contemporary works for performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea was conceived in 2014 when I resided in Korea as a Fulbright scholar,&#8221; noted Hi Kyung Kim, UC Santa Cruz professor of music and artistic director of the festival. &#8220;I shared the vision of a collaborative orchestra project with Director General KIM Hae-suk of the National Gugak Center: a world premiere program by several American composers written for the Korean Traditional Orchestra.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This historical presentation at the Pacific Rim Music Festival will be the first time the National Gugak Center presents such a premiere program outside of Korea,&#8221; Kim noted.</p>
<p><strong>The theme of the 2017 festival</strong> is <em>From the Root to the Living Tradition</em>. It opens on Wednesday, October 25, with "From the Root," a performance featuring traditional court music, folk music and dance performed by the Creative Traditional Orchestra of the Korea National Gugak Center.</p>
<p>The following evening, Oct. 26, will focus on new works by contemporary Western and Korean composers, performed by the <a href="http://www.borromeoquartet.org"><strong>Borromeo String Quartet</strong></a>, Festival Ensemble Korea, and the National Gugak Center Chamber Ensemble.</p>
<p>On Friday, October 27, the <a href="https://www.nynme.org"><strong>New York New Music Ensemble</strong></a> and Festival Ensemble Korea will present new compositions by Benjamin Carson, Chaya Czernowin, CHOE U-Zong, David Cope, Karlton Hester, Larry Polansky, Laurie San-Martin, LIM Jun-Hee, and Richard Carrick.</p>
<p>And the October 28 concert will highlight Korean and American young composers with new music by graduate student composers from UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Columbia University, Korea National University of Arts, and Seoul National University. These works will be performed by the Borromeo String Quartet, the New York New Music Ensemble, and Festival Ensemble Korea.</p>
<p>The festival closes on Sunday, October 29, with &#8220;Living Tradition&#8221;&#8211;a concert of all premieres by the Creative Traditional Orchestra of the National Gugak Center, Korea. The composers include BAEK Dae-Ung, Chinary Ung, David Evan Jones, Edmund Campion, George Lewis, LEE Geonyong, Hi Kyung Kim, Shih-Hui Chen, and from the New York Philharmonic&#8217;s Very Young Composer&#8217;s program, Madeline Schmidt and LEE Sangjin.</p>
<p><strong>Founded in 1996, the Pacific Rim Music Festival</strong> at UC Santa Cruz was designed to bridge the gap between different cultures and traditions, and to develop new musical traditions for contemporary global culture. Over the past 21 years, the festival has promoted numerous international collaborative projects and presented 120 world premiere compositions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pacific Rim Music Festival represents a historically unprecedented collaboration between Korean and Western large-scale orchestras and ensembles and Western and international composers, with compositions performed using traditional Korean and Western instruments,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz arts dean Susan Solt. &#8220;This festival is an opportunity to embrace traditions outside of our own, and to take in the richness that the sharing of ideas and art in its many forms brings to all of our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The festival is also a reflection of the exceptional creativity that is a hallmark of the UC Santa Cruz Music Department and our commitment to bringing world music in its rich diversity to our students, to UC Santa Cruz, and to our community,&#8221; Solt added.</p>

The public is invited to these events, which are part of UCSC's <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/index.html">2017 Founders Celebration</a>.</p>
<p>The Coastal Biology building now houses the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB), which had been split between two locations for many years, with marine scientists in the Ocean Health building on the Coastal Science Campus and the rest of the department located on the main UCSC campus. Spirits are high now that people are settling into the new building after the stress of moving their offices and labs over the summer, said EEB professor and department chair Ingrid Parker.</p>
<p>"The building itself is beautiful, and it's been a huge lift now that we're in it," Parker said. "Our department is renowned for its deep commitment to linkages across disciplines, and that includes the links between land and sea, so I'm really excited to have us all together again."</p>
<p>Designed by the San Francisco architecture firm EHDD, the two-story building includes labs, offices, meeting spaces, and a 125-seat seminar room that opens up to a courtyard. "The architecture includes a lot of neat details," Parker said. "The natural light inside is beautiful, and there are special touches that make it feel like it was designed for us as field biologists and people who love nature."</p>
<p>Across the road from the main building are new greenhouses for research and habitat restoration. Related projects have also come together at the same time, creating new opportunities for teaching and research at the Coastal Science Campus, said Peter Raimondi, professor of EEB and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences.</p>
<p>"It's really state-of-the-art, not only the new building itself, but the location is ideal for conveying science to students because we can so easily take them into the field, and with all of the co-located research labs, there are all kinds of great opportunities for the students," Raimondi said.</p>

<p>In addition to the Coastal Biology building, Long Marine Laboratory, and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, the Coastal Science Campus is also home to a NOAA fisheries science laboratory, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife marine wildlife center, and Younger Lagoon Reserve, where 72 acres of the 100-acre campus are set aside for environmental restoration and preservation of sensitive habitat.</p>
<p>The Coastal Biology building was the first major construction project to be carried out under UCSC's Coastal Long Range Development Plan (CLRDP), approved by the California Coastal Commission in 2009. The project included major infrastructure upgrades for the entire Coastal Science Campus, including new paths for walking and biking, overlooks with interpretive panels, and a small public access parking lot.</p>
<p>Younger Lagoon Reserve, part of the UC Natural Reserve System, was established in 1986 as a 25-acre reserve of lagoon, beach, marsh, and coastal bluff habitat adjacent to Long Marine Laboratory. In 1999, UCSC purchased from Wells Fargo Bank approximately 55 acres of the upland terrace next to Long Marine Lab, of which 47 acres were added to Younger Lagoon Reserve. The developable area where the Coastal Biology building sits has been named the Wells Fargo Coastal Science Research Center.</p>
<p>The expansion and renovation of the marine vertebrate facilities at Long Marine Laboratory was also recently completed, providing larger pools and upgraded facilities. The new Coastal Biology building has opened up space in the marine lab's Ocean Health building to house new programs, such as the graduate program in Coastal Science and Policy. The habitat restoration work on the expanded reserve is also creating new opportunities for students and researchers, Raimondi said.</p>
<p>"The restoration work has been great, and now that the construction work is done and the public access trails are open, we're seeing a lot of people from the community enjoying the site and the coastal access," he said.</p>

<p>The awards were presented at the annual Fall breakfast hosted by Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to recognize the extraordinary contributions and accomplishments of our faculty and staff across the Division of Social Sciences," said Mitchell. "Collectively, these four people have provided nearly 100 years of service to UC Santa Cruz. We are fortunate to call them colleagues."</p>
<p>The four awards presented today were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Golden Apple Teaching Award: </strong>Associate Professor of Sociology Deborah Gould is this year's recipient. Gould, who joined the faculty in 2009, was recognized for her teaching and mentorship. She is "deeply respected by her colleagues and students for her relentless commitment to teaching high-quality sociology graduate and undergraduate courses across the curriculum." Gould creates an open and inclusive classroom environment, and students value her as a passionate, inspiring, extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and approachable faculty member. Gould received a $2,500 cash award and a golden apple trophy.</li>
<li><strong>Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research</strong>: Barbara Rogoff, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Distinguished Professor of Psychology, has made vast contributions to the field of developmental psychology. Her research analyzes changing cultural practices of learning by children by integrating the individual, interpersonal, and cultural aspects of early development in different cultural contexts, especially Guatemala. She has published an extraordinary number of books and journal articles and is deeply committed to mentoring her colleagues and students. Rogoff, who joined the faculty in 1991, received a $2,500 cash prize and a crystal trophy.</li>
<li><strong>Outstanding Staff Award:</strong> Martha Brown, senior editor for the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, was recognized for her contributions to numerous publications, as well as for her "wisdom, experience, historical perspective, and common sense problem solving skills." Brown was nominated by an "impressive range" of colleagues who appreciate the quality and impact of her work, as well as her dedication, good humor, availability, and willingness to collaborate. Brown, who joined the staff in 1984, received a $1,500 cash prize and a plaque.</li>
<li><strong> Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Award: </strong>Professor Emerita Catherine Cooper of Psychology was recognized as a "visionary scholar" whose scholarship has empowered youth to help themselves. Founder of the developmental psychology doctoral program at UC Santa Cruz, Cooper is widely known for her research on the academic development of underrepresented and under-resourced youth. Her work focuses on how students forge their personal identities, exploring how they navigate their cultural and family traditions with those of their schools, communities, and workplaces. Her research has impacted colleagues, students, teachers, community organizations, lawmakers, and adolescents and their families. Cooper joined the faculty in 1987 and retired in 2012, but she remains active in research, and she also serves on numerous campus, community, and UC boards and organizations. The award includes a plaque.</li>

evento para estudiantes de escuelas secundarias y sus familiares, titulado La Noche de las Estrellas, fue el primer evento en español del observatorio</article-subhead><article-text><p>El viernes, 29 de septiembre, estudiantes de escuelas secundarias de Watsonville, Salinas, Gonzales, y Soledad tuvieron la oportunidad de ver la luna y las estrellas con dos poderosos telescopios en el observatorio James Lick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Una de nuestras metas fue inspirar a estudiantes de nuestras comunidades y fomentar su inter&#233;s en las ciencias,&#8221; dice Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, profesor y jefe del departamento de astronom&#237;a y astrof&#237;sica en UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Era importante incluir a sus padres en este evento para darles a conocer que hay oportunidades para sus hijos en ciencias. Hablamos sobre lo importante que es ir a la universidad y asegurarles que esta universidad les da la bienvenida y valora su cultura.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz fue uno de los oradores de La Noche de las Estrellas, el primer evento con presentaciones en espa&#241;ol, del observatorio James Lick el viernes 29 de septiembre. &#200;l entusiasm&#243; a los estudiantes con su historia de los or&#237;genes c&#243;smicos del oro. (En las encuestas, Ramirez-Ruiz era la persona que los estudiantes eligieron volver a ver).</p>
<p>El evento fue organizado por Sandra Faber y David Koo, astr&#243;nomos de UC Santa Cruz, quienes proporcionaron fondos a trav&#233;s de una beca de investigaci&#243;n de la Fundaci&#243;n Nacional de Ciencias (NSF). Ellos y varios otros astr&#243;nomos de UC Santa Cruz, incluyendo la directora del observatorio, Claire Max, estaban disponibles para interactuar con los estudiantes y sus familias.</p>
<p>Faber y Koo trabajaron con el programa de matem&#225;ticas, ingenier&#237;a, logro cient&#237;fico (MESA) y las escuelas secundarias, donde MESA apoya programas de enriquecimiento de conocimiento para reclutar estudiantes. Durante la noche, participantes recorrieron el observatorio en grupos, aprendieron sobre los telescopios, tuvieron la oportunidad de observar en telescopios de astr&#243;nomos aficionados y en los telescopios refractor (36 pulgadas) y Nickel (40 pulgadas).</p>
<p>&#8220;Cuando vi la luna, sent&#237; una peque&#241;a chispa entrar dentro de m&#237;,&#8221; dijo Monserrat Soto, estudiante de las escuela secundaria alisal en Salinas. &#8220;Todos hemos visto la luna, pero verla con un telescopio es una perspectiva completamente diferente.&#8221;</p>
<p>Estudiantes biling&#252;es de UC Santa Cruz fueron gu&#237;as para los estudiantes y sus padres. &#8220;Los gu&#237;as estuvieron bien preparados para traducir porque sentimos que era muy importante involucrar a los padres en este evento&#8221; dijo Yulianna Ortega, directora del STEM Diversity Program, quien reclut&#243; a los gu&#237;as. &#8220;Casi todos estaban en su &#250;ltimo a&#241;o, haciendo investigaciones de pregrado con UC Santa Cruz, y devolver a su comunidad es importante para ellos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adem&#225;s de tener presentaciones en espa&#241;ol y traductores para las actividades, los organizadores tradujeron los signos y videos del observatorio al espa&#241;ol. Faber ha dicho que ofrecer&#225;n el mismo evento el pr&#243;ximo a&#241;o con fondos de la subvenci&#243;n de NSF. &#160;&#8220;Planeamos acercarnos m&#225;s a las comunidades hispano hablantes y ofrecer m&#225;s de este tipo de eventos en el futuro por parte del observatorio James Lick, por lo que este es un buen comienzo,&#8221; dijo Faber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queremos demostrar nuestro inter&#233;s en el talento que existe en sus comunidades,&#8221; agreg&#243; Ram&#237;rez-Ruiz. &#8220;Son j&#243;venes talentosos quienes fueron invitados y queremos que sepan que los queremos en UC Santa Cruz. Buscamos constantemente el mejor talento, y es importante para nosotros hablar con estudiantes que no se ven a s&#237; mismo como cient&#237;ficos o que no conocen las oportunidades.&#8221;</p>
<p>En preparaci&#243;n para el evento, estudiantes de posgrado en el programa de astronom&#237;a de UC Santa Cruz trajeron telescopios y otras demostraciones a las escuelas secundarias para introducir conceptos basicos de astronomia, incluyendo c&#243;mo funciona un telescopio.</p>
<p>&#8220;MESA hizo un buen trabajo organizando las demostraciones y los estudiantes estaban entusiasmados y llenos de preguntas,&#8221; dijo el estudiante de posgrado Asher Wasserman. &#8220;Eran muy curiosos sobre los temas de ciencias.&#8221;</p>
<p>La coordinadora acad&#233;mica Ana Rodarte dijo que MESA est&#225; recibiendo peticiones para otro evento similar. &#8220;Los estudiantes no esperaban la experiencia que recibieron,&#8221; dijo Rodarte. &#8220;Vamos a tener otra oportunidad para ofrecer este evento.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mauricio Toussaint, embajador, y miembros del consulado mexicano en San Jos&#233; asistieron al evento junto a funcionarios de la oficina del presidente de la universidad de california (UCOP) y la universidad nacional aut&#243;noma de m&#233;xico (UNAM). Jes&#250;s Gonzales, director del instituto de astronom&#237;a (y un ex estudiante de Faber que obtuvo su doctorado en UC Santa Cruz), dio un discurso sobre la historia de astronom&#237;a, de los Mayas a investigaciones recientes. El evento tom&#243; lugar el d&#237;a despu&#233;s de una ceremonia de firma en el campus de UC Santa Cruz que estableci&#243; un programa de intercambio de estudiantes entre UC Santa Cruz y UNAM.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0df1aba8807270177ad8b80e178c9f47"><name>fehrenschmitz-island</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Paleogenomic analysis sheds light on Easter Island mysteries</title><summary>New paleogenomic research conducted by an international team led by UC Santa Cruz sheds light on the early  inhabitants of Easter Island. </summary><keywords>archaeology</keywords><start-date>1507824000000</start-date><display-name>Fehren-Schmitz-island</display-name><path>/2017/10/fehrenschmitz-island</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/fehrenschmitz-island</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1507767461820</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1525379783407</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/fehren-schmitz-moai_360.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/fehren-schmitz-moai_360.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fehren-schmitz-moai_360.jpg</name><display-name>fehren-schmitz-moai_360.jpg</display-name><file-size>42691</file-size><width>360</width><height>239</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Moai sculptures on Easter Island.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/fehren-schmitz-moai-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/fehren-schmitz-moai-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fehren-schmitz-moai-80.jpg</name><display-name>fehren-schmitz-moai-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6736</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Moai sculptures on Easter Island.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Easter Island is famous for its monumental moai sculptures, and for questions about how and when the island became inhabited--and by whom.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Easter Island is a place of mystery that has captured the public imagination. Famous for ancient carved statues and a location so remote it boggles the mind, the island presents a captivating puzzle for researchers eager to understand how and when it became inhabited, and by whom.</p>
<p>New paleogenomic research conducted by an international team led by UC Santa Cruz sheds light on those questions by ruling out the likelihood that inhabitants of Easter Island intermixed with South Americans prior to the arrival of Europeans on the island in 1722.</p>
<p>Lars Fehren-Schmitz, associate professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, presents his findings in a new paper published in the Oct. 12 edition of <em>Current Biology</em>.</p>
<p>The team analyzed bone fragments from the ancient skeletal remains of five individuals that were excavated in the 1980s and became part of the Kon-Tiki Museum's collection in Oslo. Each sample, which had been used in a previous study, yielded less than 200 milligrams of material. Three individuals lived prior to European contact, and two lived after.</p>
<p>"We found no evidence of gene flow between the inhabitants of Easter Island and South America," said Fehren-Schmitz. "We were really surprised we didn't find anything. There's a lot of evidence that seems plausible, so we were convinced we would find direct evidence of pre-European contact with South America, but it wasn't there."</p>
<p>Questions surrounding Pacific islanders' contact with South Americans are hotly debated among anthropologists. An earlier study found genetic traces of early inhabitants of the Americas in present-day indigenous residents of Easter Island. Those researchers posited that the intermixing most likely occurred between 1280 and 1425. Fehren-Schmitz was the first to use paleogenomic analysis to directly test that hypothesis; his findings indicate that contact must have taken place after 1722.</p>
<p>Slavery, whaling, mass deportations, and other activities that followed European contact gave rise to opportunities for intermixing that likely left the genetic imprint seen in islanders today, he said.</p>
<p>"The most likely scenario is that there wasn't a single episode," said Fehren-Schmitz. Acknowledging that his results answer one question but leave many others unanswered, he said, "The story is simply more complicated than we expected."</p>
<p>A member of the <a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Paleogenomics Laboratory</a>, Fehren-Schmitz uses DNA sequences recovered from preserved biological remains to trace molecular evolutionary processes through time. The analysis of DNA from ancient humans sheds light on human evolution, researchers' understanding of how humans diverged and interacted over time, and how the forces of culture and biology have shaped human genetic diversity.</p>
<p>"This study highlights the value of ancient DNA to test hypotheses about past population dynamics," said Fehren-Schmitz. "We know the island's modern populations have some Native American ancestry, and now we know that early inhabitants did not. So the big questions remain: Where and when did these groups interact to change the genetic signature of Easter Islanders?"</p>
<p>One of the mysteries of Easter Island&#8212;also called Rapa Nui&#8212;is how the island came to be populated. Located nearly 1,300 miles from the nearest inhabited island, it is 2,200 miles from central Chile on the nearest continent of South America. Some archaeologists have suggested that sea travel between Polynesia and the Americas was plausible, leading to the intermingling of those populations and perhaps even the peopling of the Americas. But plausibility isn't proof, noted Fehren-Schmitz.</p>
<p>"We want to do more work to determine more precisely when this gene flow between Native Americans and the people of Rapa Nui occurred, and where in the Americas it originated," he said. "The population dynamics of these regions are fascinating. We need to study the ancient populations of other islands&#8212;if remains exist."</p>
<p>This project also demonstrates the value of using recently developed research methods on materials from older museum collections. Tropical conditions make preservation difficult, and rib fragments are generally too soft to be desirable, but recent technological advances opened up new possibilities, said Fehren-Schmitz.</p>
<p>"Our methodologies have evolved so much in the last five years that we might need to re-study samples we gave up on in the past to see if we can get DNA out of them," he added.</p>
<p>Co-authors on the paper include Catrine Jarman at University of Bristol; Kelly Harkins at UC Santa Cruz; Manfred Kayser at University Medical Center Rotterdam; Brian Popp at University of Hawaii; and Pontus Skoglund at Harvard Medical School.</p>

<p>In 2016, Nguyen received the Pulitzer Prize for his first novel, <em>The Sympathizer</em>. Later that year, his nonfiction book, <em>Nothing Ever Dies: </em><em>Vietnam and the Memory of War</em><em>,</em> was named a finalist for the National Book Award.&#160;</p>
<p>Next Thursday, October 19, Nguyen will give a reading at the Humanities Lecture Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus at 7 p.m. as part of the campus&#8217;s 2017 fall <strong><em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/living-writers-fall-17.html">Living Writer Series</a></em></strong>. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>A professor at USC and a critic for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, Nguyen is well known for his compelling exploration of the immigrant experience. Born in Buon Me Thuot, Vietnam, he came to the United States in 1975 with his family and was initially settled in Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, one of four camps for Vietnamese refugees.</p>
<p>Nguyen ended up in San Jose, where his parents opened one of the first Vietnamese grocery stores in the city. He used that setting for his most recent book of fiction, a short story collection titled <em>The Refugees</em>, which was published earlier this year.&#160;</p>
<p>A review of the book in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> noted that &#8220;wistfulness threads through <em>The Refugees</em> like an anthem of displacement,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the collection casts a formidable spell, especially at this political moment when refugees are both a lightning rod and an abstraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the MacArthur Foundation noted, &#8220;Nguyen's body of work not only offers insight into the experiences of refugees past and present, but also poses profound questions about how we might more accurately and conscientiously portray victims and adversaries of other wars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nguyen&#8217;s essays and short stories have appeared in a wide variety of publications including the <em>New York Times, The Guardian, Time, The Atlantic, Ploughshares, </em>and the<em> Asian American Literary Review</em>. He is also the author of the book, <em>Race and Resistance: Literature and Politics in Asian America</em>.</p>
<p>A graduate of UC Berkeley, Nguyen is currently affiliated with the University of Southern California, where he is the Aerol Arnold Chair of English and a professor in the Department of American Studies and Ethnicity and the Department of Comparative Literature.</p>

As the two stars spiral toward one another and merge to form a "hyper-massive" neutron star, a small fraction of the matter is ejected in a tidal tail (labeled "red component" in the diagram). The merger generates a short gamma-ray burst resulting from twin jets of material moving out from the rotational poles of the merger at close to the speed of light, likely triggered after the collapse of the remnant onto a black hole. In addition, an intense outflow of neutrinos from the hyper-massive neutron star drives a wind of material moving at about one-tenth the speed of light (labeled "blue component" in the diagram). The blue and red wavelengths that dominate the light from the kilonova at different stages result from different elements in the ejected material, which is heated by radioactive decay processes.

From that moment on August 17, the race was on to detect a visible counterpart, because unlike the colliding black holes responsible for LIGO's four previous detections of gravitational waves, this event was expected to produce a brilliant explosion of visible light and other types of radiation.</p>
<p>A small team led by Ryan Foley, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, was the first to find the source of the gravitational waves, located in a galaxy 130 million light-years away called NGC 4993. Foley's team captured the first images of the event with the 1-meter Swope Telescope at the Carnegie Institution's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.</p>
<p>"This is a huge discovery," Foley said. "We're finally connecting these two different ways of looking at the universe, observing the same thing in light and gravitational waves, and for that alone this is a landmark event. It's like being able to see and hear something at the same time."</p>
<p><strong>New window</strong></p>
<p>Theoretical astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and a member of Foley's team, said the observations have opened a new window into understanding the physics of neutron star mergers. Among other things, the results could resolve a hotly debated question about the origins of gold and other heavy elements in the universe, which Ramirez-Ruiz has been studying for years.</p>
<p>"I think this can prove our idea that most of these elements are made in neutron star mergers," he said. "We are seeing the heavy elements like gold and platinum being made in real time."</p>
<p>Foley's team is publishing four papers October 16 in <em>Science</em> based on their observations and analysis, as well as three papers in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>, and they are coauthors of several more papers in <em>Nature</em> and other journals, including two major papers led by the LIGO collaboration. The key <em>Science</em> papers include one presenting the discovery of the first optical counterpart to a gravitational wave source, led by UCSC graduate student David Coulter, and another, led by postdoctoral fellow Charles Kilpatrick, presenting a state-of-the-art comparison of the observations with theoretical models to confirm that it was a neutron-star merger. Two other <em>Science</em> papers were led by Foley's collaborators at the Carnegie Institution for Science.</p>
<p>By coincidence, the LIGO detection came on the final day of a scientific workshop on "<a href="https://kspa.soe.ucsc.edu/2017">Astrophysics with gravitational wave detections</a>," which Ramirez-Ruiz had organized at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and where Foley had just given a talk. "I wish we had filmed Ryan's talk, because he was so gloomy about our chances to observe a neutron star merger," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "But then he went on to outline his strategy, and it was that strategy that enabled his team to find it before anyone else."</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Foley's strategy involved prioritizing the galaxies within the search field indicated by the LIGO team, targeting those most likely to harbor binary pairs of neutron stars, and getting as many of those galaxies as possible into each field of view. Other teams covered the search field more methodically, "like mowing the lawn," Foley said. His team found the source in the ninth field they observed, after waiting 10 hours for the sun to set in Chile.</p>
<p>"As soon as the sun went down, we started looking," Foley said. "By finding it as quickly as we did, we were able to build up a really nice data set."</p>
<p>He noted that the source was bright enough to have been seen by amateur astronomers, and it likely would have been visible from Africa hours before it was visible in Chile. Gamma rays emitted by the neutron star merger were detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope at nearly the same time as the gravitational waves, but the Fermi data gave no better information about the location of the source than LIGO did.</p>
<p>Foley's team took the first image of the optical source 11 hours after the LIGO detection and, after confirming their discovery, announced it to the astronomy community an hour later. Dozens of other teams quickly followed up with observations from other telescopes. Foley's team also obtained the first spectra of the source with the Magellan Telescopes at Carnegie's Las Campanas Observatory.</p>
<p><strong>Rich data set</strong></p>
<p>The gravitational wave source was named GW170817, and the optical source was named Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a). By about seven days later, the source had faded and could no longer be detected in visible light. While it was visible, however, astronomers were able to gather a treasure trove of data on this extraordinary astrophysical phenomenon.</p>
<p>"It's such a rich data set, the amount of science to come from this one thing is incredible," Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>Neutron stars are among the most exotic forms of matter in the universe, consisting almost entirely of neutrons and so dense that a sugar cube of neutron star material would weigh about a billion tons. The violent merger of two neutron stars ejects a huge amount of this neutron-rich material, powering the synthesis of heavy elements in a process called rapid neutron capture, or the "r-process."</p>
<p>The radiation this emits looks nothing like an ordinary supernova or exploding star. Astrophysicists like Ramirez-Ruiz have developed numerical models to predict what such an event, called a kilonova, would look like, but this is the first time one has actually been observed in such detail. Kilpatrick said the data fit remarkably well with the predictions of theoretical models.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look like anything we've ever seen before," he said. "It got very bright very quickly, then started fading rapidly, changing from blue to red as it cooled down. It's completely unprecedented."</p>
<p>A theoretical synthesis of data from across the spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays, was led by Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, a graduate student working with Ramirez-Ruiz, and published in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>, providing a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the full range of observations. Their analysis indicates, for example, that the merger triggered a relativistic jet (material moving at near the speed of light) that generated the gamma-ray burst, while matter torn from the merger system and ejected at lower speeds drove the r-process and the kilonova emissions at ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavelengths.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz has calculated that a single neutron-star merger can generate an amount of gold equal to the mass of Jupiter. The team's calculations of heavy element production by SSS17a suggest that neutron star mergers can account for about half of all the elements heavier than iron in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Not a joke</strong></p>
<p>The detection came just one week before the end of LIGO's second observing run, which had begun in November 2016. Foley was in Copenhagen, taking advantage of his one afternoon off to visit Tivoli Gardens with his partner, when he got a text from Coulter alerting him to the LIGO detection. At first, he thought it was a joke, but soon he was pedaling his bicycle madly back to the University of Copenhagen to begin working with his team on a detailed search plan.</p>
<p>"It was crazy. We barely got it done, but our team was incredible and it all came together," Foley said. "We got lucky, but luck favors the prepared, and we were ready."</p>
<p>Foley's team at UC Santa Cruz includes Ramirez-Ruiz, Coulter, Kilpatrick, Murguia-Berthier, professor of astronomy and astrophysics J. Xavier Prochaska, postdoctoral researcher Yen-Chen Pan, and graduate students Matthew Siebert, Cesar Rojas-Bravo, and Enia Xhakaj. Other team members include Maria Drout, Ben Shappee, and Tony Piro at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science; UC Berkeley astronomer Daniel Kasen; and Armin Rest at the Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>

In close consultation with Student Health Center, we advise limiting physical activity outside and keeping building windows closed. In addition, Physical Plant Campus Services is assessing the operational impacts of shutting down air-handling units in buildings that have this capability. Where feasible, this action may be taken to reduce the amount of outside air that is being delivered. As conditions improve, employees will be encouraged to resume their regular duties outdoors.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If an employee has a chronic medical condition that may be exacerbated by the air quality, they are encouraged to follow their personal doctor's directions, and seek care in a timely manner if they have symptoms or concerns. Employees are advised to communicate and coordinate with their supervisors on any temporary accommodations that may be needed.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>EPA maintains an Air Quality Guide for Particulate pollution. You can find it&#160;<a href="http://air.mbuapcd.org">here</a>. Currently, the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Santa Cruz is 111, which is in the &#8220;Unhealthy for sensitive groups&#8221; category.&#160; EPA&#8217;s guidance for this index level is:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive groups: Avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. Consider moving activities indoors or rescheduling.</li>
<li>Everyone else: Reduce prolonged or heavy exertion. Take more breaks during outdoor activities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Finally, Environmental Health and Safety will continue to monitor this situation and update the UC Santa Cruz community as substantive developments occur.</div>

<p>The EPC&#8217;s &#8220;Paving a Path for a College-Going Generation&#8221; project plans to serve 1,930 at-risk, underrepresented students in the predominantly agricultural towns of Gonzales, Greenfield, Soledad, and King City. The U.S. Department of Education received 122 partnership applications and awarded 24 partnership grants nationwide.&#160;</p>
<p>The GEAR UP funding continues the Educational Partnership Center&#8217;s focus on improving high school graduation and college-enrollment and attainment rates for low-income, first-generation college students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions, said EPC Executive Director Maria Rocha-Ruiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;This funding will allow us to help underrepresented students in South Monterey County get on the path to college eligibility and realize their dream of graduating from college,&#8221; Rocha-Ruiz said. &#8220;We are looking forward to continuing our partnership in South Monterey County to widen the impact and build upon the foundation of the work already achieved, further building upon the existing college-going community for students and their families."</p>
<p>EPC will work with partner organizations Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Monterey County, Bright Futures Education Partnership for Monterey County, City of Gonzales, Gonzales Unified School District, Greenfield Union School District, Hartnell Community College, King City Union School District, Monterey County Free Libraries, Soledad Unified School District and South Monterey County Joint Union High School District as part of its GEAR UP program (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs).</p>
<p>Within the region to be served, only 5 percent of the population holds B.A./B.S. degrees or higher. Among the students enrolled in partner middle and high schools, 35 percent are designated English Learners, 38 percent are proficient or higher in English, only 13 percent are proficient or higher in math, and only 13 percent are assessed into college-level math, all factors which affect prospects for college graduation and college-based careers. Only 30 percent of graduating students currently enroll in college.</p>
<p>EPC has identified three goals for its program: 1) increase students&#8217; academic performance and preparation for postsecondary education; 2) increase high school graduation and enrollment in postsecondary education; and 3) increase educational expectations for students as well as student and family knowledge of postsecondary options, preparation, and financing.</p>
<p>Students will receive customized college and career advising; financial aid advising; comprehensive mentoring; academic tutoring; grade-relevant college and career curriculum; plus services that extend and enrich the school day and year, such as summer academies, and early college experiences; referrals to essential college support services at their respective colleges; and improved instruction designed to prepare all students for college and careers.</p>
<p>The Educational Partnership Center coordinates student academic preparation efforts of UC Santa Cruz with the goal of increasing access and opportunity to postsecondary education for students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="17e47699807270177ad8b80e9b80065a"><name>leauthaud-packard-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Alexie Leauthaud wins prestigious Packard Fellowship</title><summary>Leauthaud is the 13th UCSC faculty member, and sixth UCSC astronomer, to receive a Packard Fellowship.</summary><keywords>Alexie Leauthaud, dark matter</keywords><start-date>1508158800000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Alexie Leauthaud wins prestigious Packard Fellowship</display-name><path>/2017/10/leauthaud-packard-fellowship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/leauthaud-packard-fellowship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1507934368406</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1508160791609</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</name><display-name>alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>119835</file-size><width>375</width><height>449</height></image><image-alt>Alexie Leauthaud</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20090</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alexie Leauthaud</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Alexie Leauthaud (Photo by T.

<p>The Packard Fellowship, one of the nation's most prestigious honors for early-career scientists, gives Leauthaud $875,000 over the next five years to support her research on the connection between dark matter and galaxy formation. She will use the technique of "gravitational lensing" and data from a large imaging survey covering tens of millions of galaxies to address how galaxies and cosmic structures grow over time within a cosmological landscape dominated by invisible dark matter.</p>
<p>Leauthaud leads the galaxy formation working group for the "HSC Survey," which uses the Hyper Suprime Camera on the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii.</p>
<p>"This is an impressive state-of-the-art instrument that stands 3 meters high, weighs 3 tons, and is the largest camera in the world," she said. "Our team uses this camera to collect the most accurate and deep data available to measure gravitational lensing."</p>
<p>Gravitational lensing occurs when the gravity of a galaxy in the foreground of an image bends and distorts the light from another galaxy behind it. The bending of light by gravitational lensing can be used to measure the mass of the object in the foreground, including the invisible mass of the galaxy's dark matter halo. The data collected by the HSC Survey over the next three years will enable Leauthaud to characterize the link between galaxies and dark matter and map out the growth of cosmic structures over time in ways that were not previously possible.</p>
<p>"The results of this program have the potential to revolutionize our understanding about the fundamental makeup of the universe," she said.</p>
<p>Although the nature of dark matter remains a mystery, it appears to account for about 82 percent of the matter in the universe. As a result, the evolution of structure in the universe has been driven by the gravitational interactions of dark matter, while the ordinary matter that forms stars and galaxies follows the distribution of dark matter. Galaxies form in the center of dark matter halos ("big fluffy balls of dark matter"), Leauthaud explains, while on larger scales, dark matter is distributed in a vast cosmic web, with clusters of galaxies forming at the nodes of the web.</p>
<p>Leauthaud wants to understand the connections between galaxies and dark matter across a broad range of mass scales, from tiny dwarf galaxies to enormous clusters of galaxies (the largest structures in the universe).</p>
<p>The techniques developed by Leauthaud's team will pave the way for major cosmology projects now in the planning stages, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Wide-Field Infrared Telescope, which are the top priorities in the 2020s for the National Science Foundation and NASA, respectively.</p>
<p>Leauthaud is the 13th UCSC faculty member, and sixth UCSC astronomer, to receive a Packard Fellowship, awarded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to support young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity. It is among the nation's largest nongovernmental fellowships, designed to allow maximum flexibility in how the funding is used.</p>
<p>Leauthaud earned her M.S. at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris and her Ph.D. at the Laboratory of Astrophysics in Marseille, both in astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz in 2016, she was a researcher at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Tokyo.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/science/packard-fellowships-for-science-and-engineering/fellows-highlights/2017-packard-fellowships-science-engineering-awarded-18-researchers/</url><title>Packard Foundation announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="17fe98d7807270177ad8b80e5de3bad7"><name>slug-pride-events</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>I ❤ UCSC Week to further Slug pride</title><summary>In an effort to unite the student body and spark Slug pride, I ❤ UCSC Week will host a variety of events on campus starting on Oct. 16.</summary><start-date>1507878000000</start-date><display-name>Slug pride</display-name><path>/2017/10/slug-pride-events</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/slug-pride-events</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1507936081121</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1507936801879</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/heart-ucsc.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/heart-ucsc.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>heart-ucsc.jpg</name><display-name>heart-ucsc.jpg</display-name><file-size>147761</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Students on campus</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an effort to unite the student body and spark Slug pride, "I &#10084; UCSC Week" will host a&#160;variety of events on campus&#160;from Oct. 16&#8211;20.</p>

The index was devised by CollegeNet chief executive Jim Wolfston, who is not a fan of the well-known college rankings. The SMI aims to measure the extent to which a college or university educates economically disadvantaged students (family incomes below the national median) at lower tuition, so they can graduate and obtain good paying jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz, 13th in the nation on the most recent index, was selected as an innovator because of its continuing commitment to a &#8220;whole student&#8221; philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our central objective is educational equity,&#8221; said Padgett, a professor in linguistics. &#8220;We look at larger forces, like the family challenges or financial hardships that our students face, or non-cognitive factors, such as whether they have a sense of belonging on campus. These things definitely matter when you&#8217;re talking about engagement, retention and student success. It&#8217;s fantastic to see our approach recognized.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the university&#8217;s strengths cited by the award granters: the residential-college system, academic support programs dedicated to increasing the diversity of students earning bachelor&#8217;s degrees in STEM, Hispanic-Serving Institution status, and optional preparation programs offered during the summer to students who have yet to enroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is providing real educational opportunity to promising students regardless of their economic background,&#8221; Wolfston said earlier this year of the university&#8217;s efforts. &#8220;Its civic contribution is key given that economic mobility and the American Dream are rapidly deteriorating. ... UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s focus and innovation provide an example of how we can reverse these trends.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="26b6f652807270177ad8b80ed94f26c4"><name>research-frontiers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Migration, climate, housing among the topics featured during fifth annual UC Santa Cruz Research Frontiers Evening Oct. 26</title><summary>Six UC Santa Cruz researchers who are tackling "key issues of the 21st century" will be featured during the fifth annual Division of Social Sciences Research Frontiers Evening on October 26.&#13;

<p>The Clery Act (otherwise officially known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, section 485 of the Higher Education Act, codified at 20 U.S.C. 1092 (f)) is a federal law requiring colleges and universities across the United States that receive Title IV funding to disclose information about particular crimes on and around their campuses and related policies. It is the policy of the University to comply with its obligations under the Clery Act and California law.</p>
<p>In accordance with statutory requirements, the University strives to ensure students, faculty, and other academic appointees, and staff employees (the &#8220;University Community&#8221;), have access to accurate information about crimes committed on and around the Campus; as well as, access to University-wide security policies and related local campus procedures and a confidential reporting process for victims and witnesses. This Policy describes roles and responsibilities for the University Community related to compliance with legal requirements regarding crime reporting, awareness, and prevention.</p>

A passing shrimp-like amphipod appeared to be carrying a tiny orange pack on its back.</p>
<p>Intrigued, McClintock, then a young assistant professor of polar and marine biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, scooped up the creature and took it back to the lab at McMurdo Station where he and a fish biologist teased the pack from the creature&#8217;s back.</p>
<p>To their stunned surprise, the orange pack opened up and flew away.</p>
<p>The tiny sea butterfly, which had been captured and held by the amphipod, turned out to contain an unpalatable chemical that kept the crustacean from becoming lunch for some hungry fish. Its discovery not only landed McClintock in the pages of the prestigious journal <em>Nature</em> but also launched a career that has made him a something of scientific rock star.</p>
<p>McClintock (biology, &#8217;78, Cowell) has published 265 scientific papers, written two books, spoken about his work in front of 1,000 people at a Moth storytelling event at Lincoln Center in New York City, and had a point in McMurdo Sound in Antarctica named after him by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names in honor of his work. More importantly, his research in Antarctica has included studies on ocean acidification, the effects of climate change on marine life, and the discovery of chemicals contained in seaweed and sponges that may hold promise for treatment of melanoma and the deadly MRSA bacterium that is resistant to many antibiotics.</p>
<p>If not for two professors at UC Santa Cruz, his story might have been very different.</p>
<p>Arriving at the wooded campus from Santa Barbara with the idea of studying English, McClintock remembers becoming intrigued when a Cowell College core course in biology turned to talk of marine invertebrates. He soon signed up for an invertebrate zoology course taught by John Pearse and Todd Newberry, now both emeritus professors in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology, which focused on these amazing and adaptable creatures.</p>
<p>As McClintock tells it, &#8220;John is this amazing teacher who has a way of grabbing you by the soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pearse, for his part, recommended that McClintock spend a semester at a UC marine research lab in Bodega Bay studying sea stars and sea urchins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim was a self-starter,&#8221; remembers Pearse, who later invited McClintock to accompany him to Antarctica as a postdoctoral researcher. &#8220;He was very curious and outgoing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if Pearse grabbed McClintock&#8217;s soul, Antarctica took his heart. He&#8217;s been there 15 times as a researcher and 10 times as lead lecturer for an annual philanthropic cruise focused on climate change and organized by the ship line Abercrombie and Kent. Listen to him talk by phone from his campus office in Birmingham and his description of Antarctica is close to poetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale of the landscape is absolutely stunning,&#8221; he says. Mountain ranges that appear close enough to touch are actually hundreds of miles away. The sea surface, glassy and calm one minute, can be lifted into the air by hurricane-force winds a few moments later, while the ice is alive with unimaginable shades of blue and green.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t come back from Antarctica the same way you left,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>His research trips, the last 25 years of which have been funded with grants from the National Science Foundation, have included a collaboration with Bill Baker, a marine natural products chemist from the University of South Florida, and Charles Amsler, a seaweed biologist also from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.</p>
<p>Working out of remote Palmer Station, the trio has focused on defense mechanisms developed by invertebrates and seaweed involving chemicals that are unpalatable and sometimes toxic to their predators. The research also has had implications for drug development including the discovery of a substance in sea squirts that appears to fight melanoma and a seaweed protein that seems to be active against the H1N1 flu, which sparked a 2009 pandemic. Most recently, the group found a compound in an Antarctic sponge that could help in the treatment of a specific type of the deadly MRSA bacteria.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, McClintock, along with his colleague Richard Aronson at the Florida Institute of Technology, is also charting the movement of king crabs up the Antarctic Slope as ocean temperatures rise. The arrival of these claw-equipped predators on the Antarctic Shelf could cause incredible damage to a pristine sea floor where rare invertebrates like sponges and anemones thrive, he says.</p>
<p>But if the excitement of discovery brings McClintock back to Antarctica, the rapid changes he&#8217;s witnessed there make him worry for our future.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s studied the impacts of ocean acidification and watched a glacier that used to calve once a week now release chunks of ice four to five times a day, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can look across from Palmer (Station) and see the ghost rookeries where, 45 years ago, there were 15,000 breeding pairs&#8221; of Ad&#233;lie penguins, says McClintock by telephone from Birmingham where he is now an endowed university professor of polar and marine biology.&#160; &#8220;Now there are 1,500 breeding pairs, which means 90 percent are gone, and we know very confidently it is because of climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seabirds, he explains, lay their eggs the same week each year but because of climate change, unseasonable snowstorms sometimes bury the colony, and when the snow melts, the penguin eggs and chicks drown.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the reasons, he says, he has shepherded 200 well-heeled cruise-ship passengers to the Antarctic each year for the past decade.</p>
<p>Experiencing a beach filled with a mass of penguins that have no fear of humans and will often wander up to inspect their two-legged visitors, seeing humpbacks surface, and hearing scientists talk about how climate change is threatening the breathtaking landscape and wildlife can bring people to tears, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people go home as ambassadors for Antarctica. They talk to senators and politicians about climate change,&#8221; McClintock says.</p>
<p>That outreach has made him understand the importance of scientists letting their voices be heard. He helped start a website, UAB in Antarctica, which allows lay people an up-close look at scientific research; has traveled across the country speaking to students from third grade to college; and has lectured in front of groups including the famed Explorers Club. In fact, he says, since the United States pulled out of the Paris Accord, which laid out a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, his requests for climate-change talks have increased.</p>
<p>Yet his message, he says, is also hopeful.</p>
<p>He likes to tell the story of the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in the 1980s, when scientists released a paper detailing how the protective layer between earth and the sun was thinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I like to tell people is that within several years of one of the most important papers of the 20<sup>th</sup> century,&#8221; McClintock says, &#8220;we had 20 countries sitting around a table in Montreal, and they OK&#8217;d the Montreal Protocol,&#8221; which phased out products that were harmful to the ozone layer. The treaty has now been ratified by 197 parties.</p>
<p>Last year, McClintock says, a new paper showed that rather than expanding, the ozone hole is shrinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I leave audiences with,&#8221; McClintock says. &#8220;That maybe we can get together and figure this out after all.&#8221;</p>

The major changes apply to travel of less than 30 days within the continental United States:</p>
<p>Lodging:&#160;The maximum daily lodging expense reimbursement rate is $275, excluding taxes and mandatory fees.</p>
<p>A request for reimbursement in excess of this cap amount due to the inability of the traveler to obtain lodging within the maximum rate will require written justification and submission of documentation, such as screenshots of comparison nearby hotel rates taken at the time of booking.</p>
<p>An exception is allowed if a meeting or conference is held at a hotel in which the lodging rate exceeds the $275 threshold. Under these circumstances, additional documentation does not need to be provided.</p>
<p>Meals and incidentals: maximum daily reimbursement for meals and incidentals is $62.<br/><br/>Travel-related guidance and forms on the Financial Affairs website are being updated to reflect these changes.

As he begins his second full academic year as dean, we sat down with Dean Wolf to discuss his first year and his plans for the future of the engineering school.<br/><br/>Wolf&#8217;s background is in computer science and computer engineering. He has done research in a wide range of areas, most recently focusing on cloud data centers. At UC Santa Cruz, he is leading the engineering school during a period of rapid growth in student enrollments. With nearly 4,500 undergraduate students and 600 graduate students, the Baskin School of Engineering now accounts for more than a quarter of UCSC&#8217;s undergraduates and a third of its graduate students.<br/><br/>"That quick ramp up over the past several years has strained our academic and administrative services, but we've been very successful in hiring, and we have 11 new faculty members joining us this year," Wolf said. "Particularly significant is that four of the 11 new faculty are women. Women have historically been woefully underrepresented here at Baskin and in engineering schools across the country, typically around 20 percent, so we're happy to be able to move the needle by hiring above that."<br/><br/>In the following excerpts from our conversation, Wolf shared more thoughts on diversity in engineering, as well as on experiential learning, Silicon Valley, the local technology industry, and more.<br/><br/><strong>Q. What were some of the highlights of your first year as dean of engineering at UC Santa Cruz?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> I felt it was very important, before embarking on any major initiatives, to put in place a strong staff and faculty leadership team. I also wanted to increase the involvement of faculty in leadership positions in the dean&#8217;s office. We have been putting a lot of energy into improving student success and undergraduate advising, and have hired a talented and dynamic new director of undergraduate affairs, Dr. Carmen Robinson, who has been honored for her work with transfer students in particular. We&#8217;ve formed two new research centers, one focused on Cyber-Physical Systems and one on Data Science, both very exciting areas of research. And we are building out new labs for robotics and for smart power in the facilities at 2300 Delaware Avenue.<br/><br/><strong>Q. What can we expect in the coming year? Tell us about some of your future plans and goals for the engineering school.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> We&#8217;re continuing to recruit new faculty, and we will be enhancing our graduate education programs to provide more mentoring and instruction of our graduate student teachers to help them be effective TAs and learn that side of the profession. We also want to infuse our undergraduate curriculum with more experiential learning, building on the very successful capstone program that gives students in several departments significant hands-on, project-based experience. Given that engineering is about building things and making things, it&#8217;s important that we give our students as much of that experience as we can. My long-term goal is to expand experiential learning both horizontally across departments and vertically throughout the curriculum, so more students get the experience earlier and more fully.<br/><br/><strong>Q. Do you see a need to educate all students, not just engineers, in at least some aspects of engineering?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> I would say that this is one of the most important intellectual challenges for the campus, and also an opportunity. Engineering as a field is quickly moving from being somewhat isolated, intellectually, to becoming one of the fundamental areas in which a well-informed citizen needs to have knowledge. The students themselves are telling us this: in 2015-16 (the most recent data I have), 36 percent of the students taking engineering courses were majoring outside of engineering. The students see that this is the way the world is going. At the same time, our engineering students also need breadth. So I&#8217;m going to be working with my fellow deans to think about how we can insure that our students leave here with a full set of skills. We need people who are conversant in all of the humanities, the arts, the sciences, social sciences, and engineering. If you look at future jobs and the future challenges facing our society, it&#8217;s hard to find ones that don&#8217;t involve some aspect of all of those.<br/><br/><strong>Q. The need to increase the diversity of STEM fields, and of engineering in particular, is a nationally recognized issue. How is diversity being addressed in the Baskin School of Engineering?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> We have a vibrant portfolio of student organizations and clubs that are not only about pizza parties, but about professionalism and peer mentoring. They have grown up to fill a need that is both discipline-oriented and focused on the retention and success of the historically underrepresented. Some of these are local chapters of national organizations, and some are homegrown clubs. I believe that the dean&#8217;s office can play a vital role in nurturing and helping these groups to collaborate and advance. I am confident we&#8217;ll be successful if we work from the students&#8217; own energy to help that along.<br/><br/>We are also a partner in the SEMILLA project, a campus initiative funded by a grant from the Department of Education, which is allowing us to increase support for MEP, the Multicultural Engineering Program. MEP provides a more formal structure in which to develop peer mentoring and essential services to increase retention and success among our underrepresented groups, and it is an extremely important part of our mission. As an engineering school within a major research university that is also an Hispanic-serving institution, we are quite unique. That rare combination presents a wonderful opportunity to create an educational environment that is as inclusive as it is rigorous.<br/><br/><strong>Q. Has its proximity to Silicon Valley helped the engineering school build strong connections with the technology industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Absolutely. Silicon Valley has been a wellspring of innovation and an ecosystem for exploiting new technologies developed in universities, and we&#8217;ve been connecting with that in several ways. Industry sponsors engage deeply with our students through the Corporate Sponsored Senior Projects Program. Our research centers have industry partners that provide funding and engage with our researchers. And we have faculty and students who are engaged in startup activities, both in Silicon Valley and here in Santa Cruz. In the future, we will build out more professional degree programs at the Silicon Valley Campus, situating faculty there so that they can be more intimately engaged with Silicon Valley industry.<br/><br/>The proximity to Silicon Valley has been extremely beneficial, but we&#8217;re also encouraged by the development of the local technology industry, and the engineering school has been an important engine for that growth. Our local tech industry is a striking manifestation of the ethos of Santa Cruz, with a focus on social good, sustainability, and life and health. As a school, the partnership with the city of Santa Cruz is emerging as one of our most valuable and exciting assets.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="302d4c6d807270175d9801f1644a68da"><name>mutualistic-networks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Understanding the coevolving web of life as a network</title><summary>A new study exploring how mutualistic species coevolve suggests rapid environmental change can destabilize networks of interacting species.</summary><keywords>John Thompson</keywords><start-date>1508346000000</start-date><display-name>Understanding the coevolving web of life as a network</display-name><path>/2017/10/mutualistic-networks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/mutualistic-networks</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1508341794894</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1509060166934</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/toucan-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/toucan-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>toucan-425.jpg</name><display-name>toucan-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>86742</file-size><width>425</width><height>325</height></image><image-alt>green-billed toucan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/toucan-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/toucan-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>toucan-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>toucan-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22589</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>green-billed toucan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Toucans, such as this green-billed toucan in Brazil, are major dispersers of seeds of some tropical forest trees, including palm trees.

But many species have mutualistic interactions with multiple partners, leading to complex networks of interacting species.</p>
<p>In a paper published October 18 in the journal <em>Nature</em>, a group of ecologists and evolutionary biologists from five universities has attempted to understand how species coevolve within large webs of mutualistic species. The study yielded surprising findings about the relative importance of direct and indirect effects within such networks.</p>
<p>"When pair-wise interactions are embedded within a larger web of interactions, what happens as the effects diffuse through the network? It's a really difficult problem to solve, and not just in biology," said coauthor John Thompson, distinguished professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Webs and networks</strong></p>
<p>The power of webs and networks is familiar in this internet age. The internet and its users form webs, as do roads and cars, businesses and cities, and the neurons within our bodies. Earth&#8217;s millions of species also form webs as species prey on each other, parasitize each other, compete for food, and form mutually beneficial associations.</p>
<p>Natural selection favors predators that are better at capturing prey, prey that have better defenses, and individuals that compete better against other species. Among mutualistic species, natural selection favors, for example, plants that are better at attracting pollinating insects and flower-visiting insects that are better at extracting pollen and nectar from flowers.</p>
<p>Just describing the full pattern of connections within these webs is a daunting task. In the new study, the authors began with a set of 75 webs of interacting species that other researchers had previously described from a wide range of terrestrial and marine environments. These webs included, for example, plants and pollinators, plants and fruit-eating birds and mammals, and anemones and anemone fish.</p>
<p>Each web had, at one extreme, species that interact with only one other species and, at the other extreme, species that interact with many other species. When drawn as a network, each species is a node and each interaction between species is a line between two nodes. Each line is therefore a direct interaction between two species.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Mathematical model</strong></p>
<p>Using these webs as a starting point, the authors developed a mathematical model that allowed them to explore for the first time how coevolution might shape the traits of species throughout complex webs of many interacting species. They wanted to understand how coevolution shapes species that interact both directly and indirectly. If two species interact and coevolve with each other, then their coevolution, in turn, could indirectly affect the future evolution of other species within the web. The authors studied the relative effects of direct and indirect coevolution on the evolution of traits within webs of different shapes.</p>
<p>Their analyses suggested two counterintuitive results. First, the stronger the importance of coevolutionary selection between partners, the greater the importance of indirect effects on overall evolution throughout the network. Second, in mutualisms involving multiple partners, the most specialized species&#8212;those species with the fewest direct partners&#8212;are more influenced by indirect effects than by their direct partners.</p>
<p>These two results, together with other results reported in the paper, have many implications for the understanding of evolution and coevolution within webs of interacting species. Among the most important are two conclusions that link evolution, coevolution, and the rate of environmental change.</p>
<p>With slow environmental change, the indirect effects of species on the evolution of other species may help mutualistic interactions persist over long periods of time. In contrast, rapid environmental change may slow the overall rate of evolution driven by direct interactions within large networks, making each species more vulnerable to extinction. With rapid environmental change, then, environments may change faster than species can adapt within large mutualistic networks.</p>
<p>"The indirect effects serve to buffer the system under slow environmental change, keeping it stable. With the kinds of rapid environmental changes we're seeing now, however, this buffering effect can actually prevent species from adapting fast enough," Thompson said.</p>
<p>The problem of direct and indirect effects within networks is not unique to biology. How to study indirect effects within webs has troubled scientists in physics, engineering, computer science, and other disciplines. The modeling framework developed by the authors is applicable to many types of networks.</p>
<p>The study began as a collaboration between Thompson and first author Paulo J. Guimar&#227;es Jr. of the University of Sao Paulo (formerly a postdoctoral researcher in Thompson's lab). The work then expanded and deepened through collaboration with Mathias M. Pires at the University of Campinas, Brazil (who also did postdoctoral research at UC Santa Cruz), Pedro Jordano from the Biological Station of Do&#241;ana in Spain, and Jordi Bascompte from the University of Zurich, with each researcher providing unique expertise.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

2005</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group (SCCBG), a local charity supporting cancer research and patient care, has awarded grants of $12,500 each to four researchers at UC Santa Cruz: <strong>Lindsay Hinck</strong>, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology; <strong>Zhu Wang</strong>, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology; <strong>Daniel Kim</strong>, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering; and <strong>Nikolaos Sgourakis</strong>, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>
<p>The SCCBG has given more than $450,000 in grants to the campus since 2005. In the past, pilot projects funded by these small grants from SCCBG have enabled UCSC faculty to obtain preliminary results that led to much larger grants from the National Institutes of Health and other fundraising agencies.</p>
<p>Lindsay Hinck&#8217;s lab is studying how breast cancer develops resistance to standard anti-estrogen therapies like Tamoxifen, which is used against breast cancer cells that are positive for estrogen receptors. Resistance to anti-estrogen therapies has been associated with increased expression of a gene called <em>Notch4</em>. Hinck's lab is studying a cell signaling pathway involved in regulating this gene. Funds from the grant will support the preparation of specialized cell lines to study the relationship between this signaling pathway and treatment resistance in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Zhu Wang&#8217;s lab is working to improve the understanding of bladder cancer progression by developing novel genetically-engineered mouse models. Building upon methods developed under a previous SCCBG grant, Zhu will now investigate the interplay of the top-ranked mutated genes identified in the Cancer Genome Atlas program's bladder cancer project. His lab wants to identify the gene mutations responsible for giving rise to different subtypes of bladder cancer. This may help clinicians identify which treatments are most effective against different types of bladder cancer.<br/><br/>Daniel Kim&#8217;s lab investigates the newly discovered "dark matter" in our genome known as long noncoding RNAs, produced by a highly abundant class of genes that do not make proteins. Many of these novel RNAs are only turned on in cancer cells. This grant will allow Kim&#8217;s lab to leverage the unique properties of RNA dark matter to detect signatures of cancer in the blood, using a state-of-the-art genomic platform called nanopore sequencing. These studies will develop non-invasive and highly specific liquid biopsy approaches for the early detection of lung cancer, when it is most curable.</p>
<p>Nikolaos&#160;Sgourakis is working to characterize novel targets on neuroblastoma tumors, a type of cancer that affects the development of the sympathetic nervous system in early infants and young children under the age of 10. Because neuroblastoma spreads quickly through the body, the survival rate is less than 50 percent and relapse is common in survivors. The grant will support the Sgourakis lab's research on a class of proteins displayed by tumor cells for immune surveillance by cytotoxic T cells, which can then eliminate the tumor. This research could lead to the development of personalized immune therapies for patients with neuroblastoma.</p>
<p>The SCCBG holds several annual events to raise funds for the programs it supports.

<p>The class of 2017 followed scientists into redwood forests, drought-stricken rivers, acidifying oceans, and neurosurgery labs. The young reporters documented scientists' efforts to save insects from pesticides, communities from farm runoff, and children from cancer, and learned how scientists are seeing the insides of cells and proteins more clearly than ever before.</p>
<p>Several of the stories focus on work by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, including bioinformatician Olena Morozova and her colleagues at the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative; biochemist Carrie Partch (biological clocks); neuroscientist Yi Zuo (seeing shifting cells); and ecologist Kristy Kroeker (untangling kelp forests).</p>
<p>Edited by program director Erika Check Hayden, this year's magazine sports a brand new design. The stories are enhanced with original illustrations and animations by the talented artists in the Science Illustration Program at CSU Monterey Bay, directed by Ann Caudle.

<p>In the midst of this tension, a small but dedicated band of faith-based organizations is doing what they consider God's work: protecting immigrants from detention and deportation.</p>
<p>The role of churches in the sanctuary movement is distinctive in three key ways, according to Katharyne Mitchell, a professor of sociology and dean of the Social Sciences Division at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who writes about them in the current issue of <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13562576.2017.1380883"><em>Space and Polity</em></a>:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Propelled by faith and a desire to help others, these groups provide enduring support that persists after others have moved on;</li>
<li>Many are willing to break the law to answer to a "higher calling;"</li>
<li>Their actions affect policy as, for example, police opt not to enter churches to remove people seeking sanctuary.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Secular organizations have to play within the rules of the game, but churches don't operate under the same constraints," said Mitchell. "Providing church asylum is not legal. It turns out human values are important in everyday practices and forms of activism. These insurgent citizens are pushing the boundaries of democracy and liberalism."</p>
<p>Since 2012, faith-based organizations have become more prominent in migration relief work as churches, synagogues, and mosques provide sanctuary to those at risk of deportation, said Mitchell.</p>
<p>"I wanted to understand how faith-based assumptions and beliefs differ from secular norms&#8212;how they intertwine with secular governments and other organizations to shape what's happening on the ground," said Mitchell.</p>
<p>A geographer, Mitchell spent four months in Europe investigating the impact of the faith-based community on the migrant crisis. She interviewed more than 50 pastors, priests, church administrators, members of activist church networks, politicians, European Union bureaucrats, aid workers, migrants, and administrators of intergovernmental organizations. Her research took her to Geneva, Vienna, Berlin, Brussels, Athens, and Mytilene, a port city on the island of Lesbos.</p>
<p>Considered sacred space, churches are an important resource for immigrants. They provide sanctuary and are a gateway to additional support, including material assistance, medical attention, and physical refuge. Publicity and media coverage of church activities can shape public opinion, said Mitchell, adding that churches can "push policy" without fear because of their historical and cultural roles in society.</p>
<p>"For many people of faith, providing sanctuary is a necessary act that's in keeping with their beliefs and their commitment to care for their neighbors," said Mitchell. "Intervention, whether it's legal or not, is a moral duty. They invoke international law, as well as 'higher' law. They say, 'It's not just my job. It's who I am.'</p>
<p>"This level of engagement has political repercussions, as the sanctuary movement and associated politics of "alternative justice" grow, said Mitchell.</p>
<p>"In Europe, this movement was greatly energized by the Pope in 2015 when he encouraged every parish, church, and faith-based community to take in one person," she said. "This was just as the pushback against Syrian refugees and others was beginning. The Pope stood up at that critical moment, when governments were looking to get around international laws, established in the wake of World War II, governing refugee assistance and asylum."</p>
<p>Faith-based organizations providing sanctuary are "relatively small but symbolically important" players in the European migrant crisis, said Mitchell. As European Union nations turn their backs on the 1951 Refugee Convention that outlines the rights of the displaced, sending refugees back to so-called "safe spaces," faith communities are refusing to go along with policies they cannot support.</p>
<p>"They are stepping into the breach caused by the fracturing of national politics and the unwillingness of the EU to continue providing aid," she said. "After World War II, when millions of refugees were displaced, Europe said 'Never again,' and yet, it's happening again. Faith-based communities are saying, 'Not on my watch.' "</p>

Their report,<span>&#160;</span><em><strong><a href="http://sustainableagriculture.net/publications/bfrdp/">Cultivating the Next Generation</a></strong>,<span>&#160;</span></em>explores the impact that this unique program &#8211; currently the only federal program explicitly dedicated to training the next generation of farmers &#8211; has had since it first received funding in the 2008 Farm Bill.</p>
<p><em>Cultivating the Next Generation</em><span>&#160;</span>describes the types of projects funded, explores best practices, provides examples of successful projects, and offers recommendations for better serving beginning farmers and identifying project impacts. Jan Perez, a research and education specialist for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), served as one of the two lead evaluators contributing to the report.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;</strong>The report provides resources and recommendations both for those running beginning farmer projects and for USDA personnel involved in the program,&#8221; said Perez. &#8220;Project leaders shared their ideas on how to best work with beginning farmers. Farmer-to-farmer strategies, one-on-one services, networking, and adult/general education methods are a few of the main strategies they found most effective,&#8221; said Perez.<strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p>Since 2008, BFRDP has invested roughly $150 million in over 250 new farmer training projects across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interest in agriculture as a career is growing,&#8221; said Juli Obudzinski. NSAC deputy policy director. &#8220;And as our current generation of farmers and ranchers prepares for retirement, so too is our need for new, talented producers who can replace them. It is our hope that this analysis will provide a better understanding of the value and impact of BFRDP in training the next generation, and help to make the program even stronger going forward.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<h4><strong><em>Program has served more than 60,000 beginning farmers</em></strong></h4>
<p>The report highlights the BFRDP projects&#8217; achievements and outcomes: over 60,000 beginning farmers have been impacted directly by projects funded by the BFRDP. Project leaders estimated that over half of their participants are now engaged in a farming career, and that nearly three-quarters of them felt more prepared for a successful career in agriculture following program completion. BFRDP has also helped nonprofit and community-based organizations, as well as academic institutions, to build their capacity and serve more farmers with better services.&#160;</p>
<p>The BFRDP funding program is also creating a new model &#8211; one that provides a variety of services to beginning farmers that are developed by collaborations between organizations (often academic and nonprofit), with direct farmer input. BFRDP projects are helping create and expand the reach of effective approaches to training beginning farmers, and appear to fill a need in the changing composition of beginning farmers.</p>
<p>The report also offers recommendations on ways to improve the program, including: continuing long-term investments in new farmer training and evaluation, deepening farmer engagement in program development, and improving the grant reporting process to ensure consistency in outcome data.</p>
<p>Other key report findings include:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>While the projects serve those who are aspiring to be farmers, to those who are somewhere in their first 10 years of farming, almost all projects focused on farmers in their first 5 years, with a significant focus on those farmers starting out at a small-scale</li>
<li>Over half of all projects served socially disadvantaged farmers as their primary audience</li>
<li>Over 90 percent of projects included farm business management training, and more than a third helped new farmers access land and capital</li>
<li>More than two-thirds of projects offered intensive programs, lasting months or even several years, designed to move aspiring farmers quickly into production</li>

<p>Activists too have struggled to understand and evaluate the power and effectiveness of horizontal movements.&#160;Why have the movements, which express the needs and desires of so many, not been able to achieve lasting change and a more just society?</p>
<p>Many assume that if only social movements could find new leaders they would return to their earlier glory and be able to sustain and achieve projects of social transformation and liberation.&#160;Where, they ask, are the new Martin Luther King Jr.s, Rudi Dutschkes, Patrice Lumumbas, and Stephen Bikos?</p>
<p>On Friday, October 27, The Center for Cultural Studies and the Institute for Humanities Research will present <em>Where Have All the Leaders Gone?&#8212;</em>a guest lecture by Duke University professor Michael Hardt, on campus at Kresge Town Hall, beginning at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Admission is free and open to the public.&#160;</p>
<p>Hardt is co-director of the Social Movements Lab at Duke University. He is the author of&#160;<em>Gilles Deleuze</em>&#160;and co-author--with Antonio Negri--of six books. Their <em>Empire</em> trilogy (<em>Empire,&#160;Multitude,</em> and&#160;<em>Commonwealth</em>) analyzes the contemporary capitalist global order and investigates the existing resources for creating alternatives oriented toward democracy and liberation.&#160;</p>
<p>Hardt and Negri&#8217;s most recent book,&#160;<em>Assembly</em>, explores how social movements today can enact lasting political transformations. In this lecture, Hardt will use examples from past theory and practice to situate and clarify some of the issues and alternatives involved in the organization of social movements today.</p>

Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Michael Dine, a professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded the <a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/sakurai.cfm">J.J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Physics</a> by the American Physical Society (APS).</p>
<p>Dine shares the prize with physicist Ann Nelson of the University of Washington "for groundbreaking explorations of physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, including their seminal joint work on dynamical super-symmetry breaking, and for their innovative contributions to a broad range of topics, including new models of electroweak symmetry breaking, baryogenesis, and solutions to the strong charge parity problem."</p>
<p>Dine and Nelson have many shared interests in particle physics and collaborated extensively during the 1990s on supersymmetry, an extension of the standard model of particle physics that aims to fill some of the remaining gaps. "We still talk a lot, because there is a lot of overlap in our interests," Dine said.</p>
<p>The Sakurai Prize will be presented to Dine and Nelson at an award ceremony during the April meeting of the APS in Columbus, Ohio. Dine's colleague at UC Santa Cruz, Howard Haber, won the prestigious award last year.</p>
<p>Much of Dine's research has been aimed at understanding questions for which the standard model does not provide answers, work that often relates to issues in astrophysics and cosmology. He was among those who proposed the existence of a particle called the axion as a solution to a puzzle known as the "strong CP problem" that could explain why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe. The axion is also a leading candidate for the mysterious dark matter that dominates the structure of the universe.</p>
<p>Dine's work on supersymmetry helped open a rich field studying the dynamics of supersymmetric theories and yielded insights into aspects of string theory. He proposed models to account for the "hierarchy problem," also known as the "problem of large numbers," which relates to the widely disparate energy scales in nature.</p>
<p>A Fellow of the APS and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Dine has held Guggenheim and Sloan Fellowships and won a Department of Energy Outstanding Junior Investigator Award. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award of the UCSC Division of Physical and Biological Sciences in 2011.</p>
<p>Dine received his B.S. from Johns Hopkins University in 1974 and his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1978. He did postdoctoral research at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, after which he was a long term member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He was the Henry Semat Professor at City College of the City University of New York, before joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1990.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="375d5280807270175d9801f19d2dc0c3"><name>morton-marcus-poetry</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Award-winning poet Dorianne Laux to read at 8th annual Morton Marcus memorial event</title><summary>Award-winning American poet Dorianne Laux will be the featured guest at the eighth annual Morton Marcus Poetry Reading, Thursday, November 16, at 5:30 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall at Cowell College.  </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz poetry, ucsc poetry, dorianne laux, poetry news</keywords><start-date>1508464800000</start-date><display-name>Award-winning poet Dorianne Laux to read at 8th annual Morton Marcus memorial event</display-name><path>/2017/10/morton-marcus-poetry</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/morton-marcus-poetry</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1508462382734</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1508464901391</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/marcus-poet-laux-400.png</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/marcus-poet-laux-400.png</link><site>news</site><name>marcus-poet-laux-400.png</name><display-name>marcus-poet-laux-400.png</display-name><file-size>237036</file-size><width>400</width><height>395</height></image><image-alt>ucsc poster for morton marcus poetry event</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/marcus-poet-laux-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/marcus-poet-laux-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>marcus-poet-laux-thumb.png</name><display-name>marcus-poet-laux-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>33397</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>ucsc poster for morton marcus poetry event</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/marcus-logo-200.png</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/marcus-logo-200.png</link><site>news</site><name>marcus-logo-200.png</name><display-name>marcus-logo-200.png</display-name><file-size>50846</file-size><width>200</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Award-winning American poet, <strong>Dorianne Laux</strong> will be the featured guest at the eighth annual <strong>Morton Marcus Poetry Reading</strong>, Thursday, November 16, at 5:30 p.m. in the Humanities Lecture Hall at Cowell College. &#160;</p>
<p>The event is held each year to honor poet, teacher, film critic, and Santa Cruz cultural icon Morton Marcus (1936-2009).</p>
<p>It was created to continue Marcus&#8217;s tradition of bringing acclaimed poets to Santa Cruz County, to acknowledge the significant role poetry has played in the community's history, and to help preserve poetry's influence in the county's culture.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz humanities lecturer and alumnus Gary Young--Santa Cruz's first ever poet laureate--will emcee the program and present a&#160;$1,000 prize to the winner of the annual Morton Marcus Poetry Contest.</p>
<p>Admission is free, and the public is invited.</p>
<p>Dorianne Laux&#8217;s most recent collections of poetry are <em>The Book of Men</em> (winner of The Paterson Prize and The Roanoke-Chowan Award for Poetry) and <em>Facts about the Moon</em> (winner of the Oregon Book Award).</p>
<p><em>The Book of Men</em> was reviewed in the <em>New York Times</em> as one of five books of poems suggested for summer reading shortly after its release.</p>
<p><em>Publisher&#8217;s Weekly</em> noted that &#8221;Laux's fifth collection continues in her descriptive, storytelling vein&#8230;Something of a baby boomer's field guide, this book portrays the legacy of the 1960s from the perspective of one who has survived and must look back on what that decade did and didn't change. And so, the Vietnam War, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Mick Jagger, Cher, Frank O'Hara, and Superman all make appearances.&#8221;</p>
<p>A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize, Laux is also the author of <em>Awake, What We Carry</em>, and <em>Smoke</em>, as well as three fine press editions, <em>Superman: The Chapbook, Dark Charms,</em> and <em>The Book of Women</em>.</p>
<p>Laux teaches poetry in the MFA Program at North Carolina State University and is a founding faculty member at Pacific University&#8217;s Low Residency MFA Program. She is also co-author of a handbook on writing, <em>The Poet's Companion: A Guide to the Pleasures of Writing Poetry.</em></p>
<p>Her reading will be followed by a book signing and reception.</p>

Unfortunately, current and projected cost increases of UC&#8217;s health benefits for retirees are greater than inflation and growing faster than the university&#8217;s budget. UC&#8217;s commitment to these benefits has not wavered, but the current model is putting the financial stability of the program at risk.<br/><br/>To preserve the retiree health-benefits program for current and future retirees, UC must evaluate options to manage costs.<br/><br/>In early 2018, the UC Office of the President will convene an advisory work group with representatives from a wide range of groups to explore potential strategies and develop options for UC leaders to consider. As they look for solutions, members of the work group will examine programmatic and plan design changes that will allow us to ensure the program&#8217;s overall financial sustainability. The work group is expected to deliver its recommendations by June.<br/><br/>This work only pertains to retiree health benefits and does not affect University of California Retirement Plan pension benefits.<br/><br/>No funding or programmatic changes regarding UC&#8217;s retiree health benefits will take place until 2019, at the earliest. The benefits offered to retirees for 2018 reflect UC&#8217;s current funding policy, with a continuing contribution of at least 70 percent of the cost of retiree health-care benefits.<br/><br/>I understand how important good health benefits are to our retirees, and to the ability of faculty and staff to plan for their financial futures. Please be assured we will keep you informed about any proposed changes to UC&#8217;s retiree health benefits.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c092e24807270175d9801f17aa3a633"><name>cross-country</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cross country bolstered by new faces</title><summary>Bolstered by a crop of fresh faces who have already made an impact in the early season, the Banana Slugs returned a core group from last year’s squad, which placed seventh at the NCAA West Regionals. </summary><start-date>1508482800000</start-date><display-name>NCAA coverage</display-name><path>/2017/10/cross-country</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/cross-country</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1508540754466</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1508540754466</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Andrew Matheson</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/cross-country-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/cross-country-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cross-country-400px.jpg</name><display-name>cross-country-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>204497</file-size><width>500</width><height>341</height></image><image-alt>Cross country team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/cross-country-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/cross-country-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cross-country-80px.jpg</name><display-name>cross-country-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>18290</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cross country team</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Bolstered by a crop of fresh faces who have already made an impact in the early season, the Banana Slugs returned a core group from last year&#8217;s squad, which placed seventh at the NCAA West Regionals. (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sophomore Paul Colosi last season became the first freshman harrier from UC Santa Cruz to reach the NCAA cross country championships&#8212;and the first male overall since 2012. He earned a spot on the all-region team after garnering a 15th-place finish at the NCAA Division III West Regionals, and he was named Male Runner of the Year and Male Rookie of the Year by the Association of D-III Independents.</p>
<p>But, despite those accolades, the Corralitos native isn&#8217;t necessarily feeling the pressure to top his campaign from a year ago. Rather, Colosi is feeling the squeeze from his teammates&#8212;and he&#8217;s welcoming it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like there&#8217;s a little bit of pressure from the incoming freshmen,&#8221; said an excited Colosi, who made his season debut with a third-place finish at the Las Positas Invitational on Sept. 15.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot more depth this year,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And in the long term, I think this team is going to do very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the women&#8217;s team will be looking to fill the void left by top runner Shannon McClish, who this year is studying abroad in Switzerland, the men&#8217;s team enters as a more solidified unit.</p>
<p>Bolstered by a crop of fresh faces who have already made an impact in the early season, the Banana Slugs returned a core group from last year&#8217;s squad, which placed seventh at the NCAA West Regionals. Anchored by Colosi, a graduate of St. Francis High in Watsonville, the youthful Slugs boast plenty of talent that will continue to improve this year and next.</p>
<p>In fact, only one senior&#8212;Takehiro Yamaya (Redondo Beach)&#8212;is listed on the 19-runner men&#8217;s team, which counts seven freshmen. Kellen O&#8217;Neill (Arcata) and Nick Kleiber (Oakland), among others, have shined in early meets for the Slugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole freshmen group is talented,&#8221; said first-year coach David Klech, who last season was an assistant under head coach Jamey Harris. Klech, a two-time All-American at the University of Oregon, where he later coached, believes the Slugs can better last year&#8217;s finish at regionals.</p>
<p>Regionals this year are scheduled for Nov. 11 at Pomona-Pitzer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a challenge to decide who the top seven (runners) are by the end of the season,&#8221; Klech said. &#8220;We had athletes step up during track season (in the spring) and there are a slew of freshmen who want to earn spots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twice recording a season-best time of 26 minutes, 7 seconds across 8,000 meters, Colosi last season was one of three Slugs who earned all-region honors. Returners Zahid Anjum (Santa Clara), a sophomore, and junior Dante Capone (Sebastopol) also earned all-region recognition after garnering a top-35 spot at West Regionals.</p>
<p>Sophomore Raymond Breault (Brisbane), who recorded a season-best 27:19 as a freshman&#8212;and who lists Colosi as his favorite athlete&#8212;had a strong track season for the Slugs. Although he&#8217;s a &#8220;speed guy,&#8221; Klech said, Breault is still expected to contribute for UCSC.</p>
<p>Also showcasing a strong track season was Draven Hawk, a junior who was sidelined last season because of injuries. Hawk, a Scotts Valley High alum, led the Slugs at West Regionals as a freshman in 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s at a level of fitness we&#8217;re definitely excited about,&#8221; Klech said of Hawk, who made his season debut with a 13th-place finish at the Las Positas Invitational.</p>
<p>Klech featured the freshmen during UCSC&#8217;s first meet, the Notre Dame de Namur Invitational at Crystal Springs on Sept. 2. There, O&#8217;Neill and Kleiber paced the Slugs to a third-place finish, clocking respective times of 28:02 and 28:12.</p>
<p>Other freshmen who have impressed include Dante De Los Santos (Napa) and Sean Reidel (Boulder, Colo.), who has looked strong in workouts, Klech said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had very fast times in high school, much faster than when I was in high school,&#8221; Colosi said of O&#8217;Neill, who garnered Runner of the Week honors by the Association of D-III Independents following the Sept. 2 race.</p>
<p>Slugs freshman Carrie Bradley (Truckee) also earned Runner of the Week honors after she ran to an 11th-place finish at Crystal Springs, recording a 26:06.5 across six kilometers.</p>
<p>Noting McClish placed 10th at Crystal Springs during a 5k race last season, Klech said Bradley has been a welcomed surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;She likes to work hard and I think she&#8217;s going to work hard at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Klech said.</p>
<p>The loss of McClish will, no doubt, have an impact on the Slugs, though. Although McClish is expected to re-join the program next year, the Slugs&#8217; top runner from a year ago was coming off a campaign in which she qualified for the national championships and earned all-region accolades.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think whenever you lose your star, it&#8217;s a challenge,&#8221; Klech said.</p>
<p>McClish&#8217;s departure will force others to step up, which could benefit the Slugs next season.</p>
<p>The Slugs count three seniors and five freshmen on their 17-runner roster. Along with Bradley, freshmen Allie Lourim (Sacramento), Abby Klein (Torrance) and Victoria Mitchell (Bentonville, Ark.) have either contributed or turned heads in the early season.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big shoes to fill, for sure,&#8221; said junior Sydney Gutierrez (San Francisco), a top returner for UCSC who narrowly missed all-region status at last season&#8217;s West Regional. &#8220;Not sure we&#8217;ll reach (McClish&#8217;s) speed, but I think everyone has the potential to improve and I think our team looks pretty strong right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gutierrez said the Slugs will still try and reach McClish&#8217;s times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone wants to be as good as Shannon,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Klech expects the women&#8217;s team to compete as it builds toward regionals, maybe even surprise a few teams along the way. The Slugs coach is excited to watch Autumn Burton (Rocklin) as she begins her senior season, along with Lizzie Meredith (Newcastle) and Bella Demachkie (Santa Barbara).</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes for senior athletes, when they know it&#8217;s their last one &#8230;&#8221; Klech said.</p>
<p>Burton posted a first-place finish (19:43.2) at the Las Positas Invitational. Bradley (20:00.9) and Gutierrez (20:20.1) were second and third, respectively, at the meet, which featured mostly community colleges.</p>
<p>The Slugs are slated to compete in Sacramento, Santa Rosa, Claremont and Sunnyvale prior to West Regionals.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a strong pack and if we&#8217;re healthy in November,&#8221; Klech said, &#8220;we&#8217;re pretty excited with what we can do there.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c19ad58807270175d9801f1cfb2c6d2"><name>regent-visit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Board of Regents chair visits to connect with campus community</title><summary>As Board of Regents chair, George Kieffer's goals include focusing on the quality of undergraduate education, examining the costs of higher education, preserving the university’s historic excellence in teaching, research and public service, and continuing to expand access to more and diverse Californians.</summary><start-date>1508742000000</start-date><display-name>UC system</display-name><path>/2017/10/regent-visit</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/regent-visit</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1508541835596</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1508782355793</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/regent-students-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/regent-students-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>regent-students-400.jpg</name><display-name>regent-students-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>184813</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Regent Kieffer meeting with students</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/regent-students-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/regent-students-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>regent-students-80.jpg</name><display-name>regent-students-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>14188</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Regent Kieffer meeting with students</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Board of Regents Chair George Kieffer said he's planning to visit all 10 University of California campuses by the year's end to learn more about the needs and concerns of each campus.&#160;(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an effort to learn more about UC Santa Cruz, UC Board of Regents Chair George Kieffer spent two days on campus meeting with faculty, staff, student leaders, alumni, and community leaders.</p>
<p>"I thought I knew Santa Cruz from other visits, but this involved a more substantive set of discussions,&#8221; Kieffer said. &#8220; I learned a great deal, particularly with respect to housing and enrollment. And everyone was both candid and helpful. It&#8217;s a very engaged group of students, faculty and staff&#8221;</p>
<p>Kieffer, who earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in history from UC Santa Barbara and a law degree from UCLA, was appointed to the Board of Regents in 2009 and previously served as an alumni regent from 1978 to 1980. He was elected board chair in July. The University of California system is governed by the 26-member Board of Regents.</p>
<p>As Board of Regents chair, his goals include focusing on the quality of undergraduate education, examining the costs of higher education, preserving the university&#8217;s historic excellence in teaching, research and public service, and continuing to expand access to more and diverse Californians.</p>
<p>Kieffer said he's planning to visit all 10 University of California campuses by the year's end to learn more about the needs and concerns of each campus. He is hoping to promote the special nature of each campus.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal said he was pleased to host Kieffer.</p>
<p>"The feedback I&#8217;ve received has been overwhelmingly positive," Blumenthal said. "His decision to engage students, staff, faculty and administrators on the issues they care about was very much noticed&#8212;and appreciated."</p>
<p>On Oct. 5, Kieffer met with faculty and administrative leadership, student government leaders, and the Staff Advisory Board.</p>
<p>Staff Advisory Board President Michael Luttrell said Kieffer was eager to hear about staff concerns, which include the housing crisis affecting the entire campus community; salary levels, given the proximity to the Bay Area; staffing levels, given recent enrollment growth; and more.</p>
<p>"Regent Chair Kieffer jumped right in asking us what was on our minds&#8212;what information would be good for him to take back to the other Regents," Luttrell said. "It was refreshing."</p>
<p>Nicole VanderMeer and Adrienne Ricker, co-presidents of the UC Santa Cruz Graduate Student Association, met with Kieffer to discuss issues graduate students face.</p>
<p>"I value the opportunity to sit down with a representative of the UC Board of Regents to discuss issues that affect UCSC graduate students like housing and normative time,&#8221; said Nicole VanderMeer, co-president of the UC Santa Cruz Graduate Student Association, "but it is frustrating when the response is consistently, 'petition your legislators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kieffer sat down on Oct. 6 with members of City on a Hill Press, Banana Slug Network, and TWANAS in a discussion that focused on UC support for DACA students, free speech on college campuses, housing access and affordability, and the long-term financial path for the system.</p>
<p>The visit wrapped up with Kieffer touring the main campus and the Coastal Science Campus.</p>
<p>"Santa Cruz is special. It&#8217;s a particular goal of mine to help illuminate the differences as well as the similarities of our campuses, both in atmosphere and issues,&#8221; Kieffer said. &#8220;They&#8217;re all great. But there&#8217;s something so very unique about Santa Cruz you won&#8217;t find anywhere else and it&#8217;s so very clear why students choose to be there. We need to help with housing and classroom space. But it&#8217;s pretty darn cool.&#8221;<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fbd484c807270175d9801f14b435fd6"><name>statement-library</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Statement on incident in library</title><summary>I was disheartened to see the video of three students at McHenry Library on Sunday demanding that another group of students who might hold different political opinions leave the building, but I commend university staff for their handling of the situation</summary><start-date>1508598000000</start-date><display-name>Campus message</display-name><path>/2017/10/statement-library</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/statement-library</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1508602889284</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1508603013323</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I was disheartened to see the video of three students at McHenry Library on Sunday demanding that another group of students who might hold different political opinions leave the building, but I commend university staff for their handling of the situation.

<p>Freedom of speech is a fundamental right in America, and it&#8217;s something we believe in fiercely at UC Santa Cruz. A university is a marketplace of ideas. It must be. We grow intellectually by listening to other opinions, sometimes liking them, sometimes not, but always listening to them. This free interchange of ideas is integral to our mission, and we are committed to protecting everyone&#8217;s right to peacefully and lawfully assemble.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="408a2778807270175d9801f1ae99c890"><name>fire-highway</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fire along Highway 1 near Western Drive</title><summary>Fire crews are working to extinguish a fire along Highway 1, near Western Drive. </summary><start-date>1508569200000</start-date><path>/2017/10/fire-highway</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/fire-highway</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1508616315781</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1508625492148</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h3>October 21, 2017&#160;</h3>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Artists and budding naturalists should make their way up to the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History at UC Santa Cruz on November 4-5.</p>
<p>The center&#8217;s sixth-annual all-ages open house and fundraiser will place a strong emphasis on natural illustration. The aptly titled <a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/community/events/index.html">&#8220;<em>Artstravaganza!</em>,&#8217;</a>&#8221; will take place at the Norris Center in the Natural Sciences 2 Building, room 239.</p>
<p>Students and members of the Santa Cruz community will have a chance to learn about illustrating nature and find out how to make prints using linoleum cuts. The open house lasts from noon to 5 p.m. on both days. Though admission is free, donations to the Norris Center are encouraged.</p>
<p>It makes sense that art and nature would join forces at this community-friendly event, said Norris Center curator Chris Lay. Artists and naturalists both benefit from &#8220;slowing down, looking carefully at living things and making good observations,&#8221; Lay noted.</p>
<p>With this principle in mind, <em>Artstravaganza!</em> will feature a student art show, hands-on art making and face painting, and artist talks and demonstrations from several student and locally renowned nature artists. Talks and demonstrations will start at 1, 2:30, and 4 p.m. each day.&#160;</p>
<p>On Saturday at 1 p.m., Juniper Harrower will give a multimedia presentation inspired by research in Joshua Tree National Park. At 2:30 p.m. that day, Emily Underwood will talk to guests about natural history print-making. Then, at 4 p.m., guests are invited to a special presentation by artist Josie Iselin, known for her captivating fine-art photography that captures the colors and textures of seaweed, marine algae, beach stones, and other treasures she discovers while walking along the seashore.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Dillyn Adamo will talk about linocut printmaking of California native plants, followed, at 2:30 p.m., by Hannah Caise, who will discuss the use of markers in scientific illustration. At 4 p.m., Mattias Lanas will close out the day by providing &#8220;perspectives in botanical illustration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also on display will be various natural history exhibits featuring specimens from the Norris Center&#8217;s growing collections, including butterflies and moths from around the world, mammals, birds, reptiles, and much more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all part of a program that is part of the Norris Center&#8217;s community outreach. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a large public display space,&#8221; Lay said. &#8220;These events become important ways to communicate to the larger public, the student body, and the larger community about what we are doing and what we support.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Norris Center was established in 2014 as part of an endowment gift from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.&#160; Its mission is to inspire and provide resources for anyone interested in studying the natural world. Through its work, the center carries on the legacy of beloved UC Santa Cruz environmental studies professor Ken Norris, a world-renowned expert in whales and dolphins who inspired many generations of UCSC students to pursue their passions as naturalists. Norris died in 1998. Currently, thanks to a generous donor, the center is expanding art/nature-related opportunities for students and the broader community.</p>
<p>Free parking will be available at the Core West Parking Structure. Close parking for mobility-impaired guests will be available in the small parking lot adjacent to the loading dock of the Science and Engineering Library.</p>

<p class="p1">Last academic year, the CITL received approximately 50 applications from faculty members for the inaugural cohort of fellows. With support from several campus sponsors, the CITL more than doubled the number of fellows&#8212;from 10 spots to 22, said Jody Greene, the center&#8217;s founding director.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It's incredibly significant for an institution to say 'teaching matters,'" Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp said. "There's enormous pressure to bifurcate research and teaching, and pretend like they have nothing to do with each other, and when we bring them together it can be powerfully transformative for both our students and our faculty."</p>
<p class="p1">The faculty fellows, representing all five academic divisions, will meet monthly to discuss their research and approaches to teaching, attend presentations, and hold workshops for other faculty members.</p>
<p class="p1">Assistant Professor Christy Byrd's research project is aimed at understanding how students respond to inclusive teaching. Byrd plans to survey students whose instructors have participated in inclusive teaching workshops at the CITL, and students whose instructors have not, to see if there are any differences from the student perspective.</p>
<p class="p1">"I want my project to show that even employing simple techniques can be helpful for students," Byrd said.</p>
<p class="p1">With a background in educational psychology, Byrd said working with the CITL is another opportunity to explore her interests that relate to teaching.</p>
<p class="p1">Teaching does not happen in a vacuum, and the CITL is hosting several programs this year that respond to changes in higher education and to the overall national climate. In light of the events at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and the rescission of DACA, the CITL is hosting several workshops with Derisa Grant, who holds a Ph.D. from the Stanford University School of Education and who facilitates community-wide conversations on diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p class="p1">"Our aim from the start has been to build a center that draws on the great tradition of teaching at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Greene noted, &#8220;while allowing us to respond nimbly to the very real and sometimes sudden challenges facing instructors in college classrooms today.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;From curating conversations on the most pressing social issues of the day, to keeping up with the pace of technology, to learning how to best support students from an impressively broad range of educational and cultural backgrounds, our faculty fellows and all of the instructors we work with are committing themselves with energy and enthusiasm to redefining and fostering excellence in teaching and learning at a 21st-century public university.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The CITL&#8217;s <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/annual-convocation/convocation-2018.html"><span class="s1">annual convocation</span></a>, on March 1-2, will feature Cathy N. Davidson, an educational innovator and a distinguished scholar of the history of technology. Davidson is an avid proponent of active ways of learning that help students to understand and navigate the radically changed global world in which we now all live, work, and learn.</p>
<p class="p1">The Faculty Fellows program has received sponsorships from the Division of Student Success, the Institute for Humanities Research, the Arts Division, the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences Division, Learning Support Services, Cultivamos Excelencia, and the Hispanic Serving Institution initiatives.</p>

The award was presented during the foundation's 34th annual gala award ceremony&#160;on Oct. 13 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The 150-year-old Cowell Ranch Hay Barn near the entrance of campus, a key building in the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, was made possible with a $5 million grant from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation. Dozens of community volunteers, including members of the Santa Cruz Construction Guild, participated in a one-day "barn raising" in March 2015 that kicked off the restoration. Period construction techniques&#8212;including mortise and tenon joinery&#8212;were used to tie together the superstructure, which was made up of new timbers as well as timber salvaged from the original barn.</p>
<p>Countless individuals participated over the coming months, before the completion of the restoration was celebrated Sept. 12, 2015. Today, the barn serves as the headquarters of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>The foundation provides statewide leadership, advocacy, and education to ensure the protection of California's diverse cultural heritage and historic places. The design awards recognize exemplary work in historic preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, sustainability, and other aspects of preservation.</p>

<p>The foundation of the paper, <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/10/e1603080">published October 25 in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, is a database mapping the global distribution of highly threatened vertebrates and invasive species on islands. The <a href="http://tib.islandconservation.org/">Threatened Island Biodiversity Database</a> lays the fundamental groundwork for planning conservation actions to prevent extinctions.</p>
<p>The first database of its kind, it is the culmination of an intensive systematic review of over 1,000 available datasets, publications, and reports, as well as consultation with more than 500 experts worldwide with specialized knowledge about native and invasive species on islands. From this investigation, researchers identified and mapped all 1,189 land-based amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals breeding on 1,288 islands and listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a>.</p>
<p>Investigators then documented whether introduced, damaging (invasive) vertebrates, such as rats and cats, occurred on the same islands. The dataset also contains important social, political, and ecological information about each island, critical for informing conservation decision-making.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunities to prevent extinctions are now laid out right in front of us,&#8221; said lead author Dena Spatz. &#8220;This knowledge base of threatened island biodiversity can really empower more efficient and better-informed conservation planning efforts, which is exactly what our planet needs right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spatz, now a conservation biologist at <a href="http://www.islandconservation.org/">Island Conservation</a>, began this work as a graduate student at the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Coastal and Conservation Action Laboratory (CCAL)</a> led by coauthors Donald Croll and Bernie Tershy (who also founded Island Conservation). CCAL, Island Conservation, BirdLife International, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) Invasive Species Specialist Group created the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database to guide conservation planning and prevent island extinctions.</p>
<p><strong>Why Islands?</strong></p>
<p>Islands are isolated landmasses surrounded by ocean that hold many of the most threatened species in the world. For example, the Floreana mockingbird in the Gal&#225;pagos Islands, Ecuador, disappeared from its namesake island in the 19th century, mere decades after human colonization. The mockingbird was wiped out primarily by invasive species on the island, including rodents and feral cats which remain on Floreana and prevent the mockingbird's safe return. The few hundred individuals left of this critically endangered bird are now confined to tiny predator-free islets adjacent to Floreana.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a common story for island wildlife, which suffer disproportionately from endangerment and extinction as compared with plants and animals on continental land-masses. In part, this is because animals on islands tend to lack defenses against mainland species often introduced, intentionally or unintentionally, by humans. Islands represent only 5.3 percent of the world&#8217;s land area, yet have hosted 61 percent of all recorded extinctions since 1500. The majority of those extinctions were driven by invasive species, particularly rodents and cats, responsible at least in part for 44 percent of bird, mammal, and reptile extinctions in recent centuries.</p>
<p>Spatz and colleagues created the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database as a foundational tool to pinpoint which species to protect, and where, to prevent extinctions.</p>
<p><strong>Hope on islands</strong></p>
<p>On some islands, it is feasible to implement biosecurity measures to prevent invasive species from arriving and becoming a threat. And for many islands with invasive species, it is possible to completely remove the interlopers, which has led to remarkable recovery stories for native species around the world. On Anacapa Island in the Channel Islands, California, for example, the successful removal of invasive rats led to positive outcomes for the vulnerable Scripps&#8217;s murrelet and the recent discovery of the endangered ashy storm-petrel.</p>
<p>Coauthor Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at Birdlife International, said &#8220;The datasets assembled for this paper support the most comprehensive assessment yet of the distribution of threatened species on islands and where they occur with invasive alien vertebrates. The analysis underpins ongoing efforts to determine on which islands preventing invasions and controlling or eradicating invasive species would provide the greatest contribution to global biodiversity conservation.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the species threatened by invasive vertebrates make up almost half of all highly threatened land vertebrates world-wide, they occur on a fraction of the Earth&#8217;s landmass and on fewer than 1 percent of the world&#8217;s islands. Many of these islands were found to be relatively small and with minimal human habitation, especially those with threatened reptiles and birds. These islands represent a significant opportunity to address the biodiversity crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The database validates the importance of islands globally for biodiversity conservation and lays the groundwork for pinpointing efficient and effective conservation action at global and regional scales,&#8221; said coauthor Piero Genovesi, head of Wildlife Service - ISPRA Institute for Environmental Protection and Research and Chair of the IUCN SCC Invasive Species Specialist Group.</p>
<p>The paper highlights a handful of these islands where conservation efforts would be important. For example, Gough Island, a U.K. Overseas Territory of the St. Helena and Tristan da Cunha island group in the Atlantic Ocean, is home to six species that are highly threatened, such as the Tristan albatross. Invasive mice occur on the island as well, threatening the survival of the albatross and other threatened species.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global nature of the paper offers a comparative look at threats to biodiversity and conservation opportunities,&#8221; Spatz said. &#8220;Furthermore, it provides national and regional governments and NGOs with critical biodiversity information assembled on a global platform, which can inform and stimulate promotion, fundraising, and action to protect species from extinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next steps, she said, are to apply the information gathered from this dataset to key conservation planning efforts at global and regional scales, combining other factors affecting the feasibility of implementing island conservation interventions to identify the most important islands where conservationists should focus global efforts to prevent extinctions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4f289986807270175d9801f11c39de9e"><name>open-forum-student-housing-west</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Open forums on Student Housing West project</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will host two open forums on Student Housing West, a new housing development project that will offer more opportunities for students to live on campus.</summary><start-date>1508828400000</start-date><display-name>Open forums</display-name><path>/2017/10/open-forum-student-housing-west</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/open-forum-student-housing-west</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1508861580687</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1509060664807</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz will host two open forums on </span><a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/housing/studenthousingwest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new housing development project that will offer more opportunities for students to live on campus.</span></p>

"We have to give students avenues, aspirations, visions of what they can do. We have to let their imaginations soar." (Photo by Melissa De Witte)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A year ago, Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell was a professor of geography, happily ensconced at the University of Washington, her intellectual home since 1993. And then Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.</p>
<p>"I was spurred to leadership by the election," said Mitchell. "I was feeling like a lot of what I value and cherish&#8212;what I love about this country, and what I love about the Earth&#8212;suddenly seemed much more fragile."</p>
<p>When a colleague alerted her that the dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UC Santa Cruz was retiring, Mitchell was intrigued. A native of Boston, Mitchell earned her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and had long considered this campus to be a beacon of innovative, interdisciplinary scholarship&#8212;a campus steeped in progressive values that offered a dynamic educational experience to students.</p>
<p>"I was feeling some despair about the future and what I could do when a colleague sent me the job description," said Mitchell. "I realized I was in a place in my career and in my life where I could take a leadership voice, contesting the things I saw coming down the pike on the national front."</p>
<p>Two months into her new job, Mitchell has brought energy, focus, and vision to the division.</p>
<p>"I want to use the resources of the university to provide faculty with what they need for their research and students with their education so that we can all work together to mitigate the harmful effects of what's going on at the national level," she said during a recent interview.</p>
<p>Already, Mitchell is reaching out to the other academic divisions on campus&#8212;arts, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and engineering&#8212;because she believes social scientists have contributions to make across the disciplines.</p>
<p>"Social scientists ask the probing questions about access, power, justice, and equity," she said. "Engineers make robots, but social scientists study how humans interact with robots. Scientists tell us water levels will rise with climate change, but social scientists are the ones who look at who will be affected, they look at the fairness of mitigations, how changes will impact schools and food distribution. That's our world. <em>Any </em>project should have a social science component."</p>
<p>An urban geographer who swims several times a week for exercise (and plans to take up surfing), Mitchell studies migration, refugee and asylum policy, citizenship, and education and democracy; her faculty appointment is in the Sociology Department.</p>
<p>Mitchell is an unapologetic champion of higher education, with a particular fondness for public universities. Faculty contribute "real research, real facts," and universities model the "importance of inquiry, civility, dialogue, and engaging across difference."</p>
<p>"We do that!" she said. "That's what happens at a university. We have to take that show on the road."</p>
<p>Mitchell's message for faculty is to keep doing high-caliber research, keep producing knowledge, and keep nurturing the critical-thinking skills of the next generation.</p>
<p>"It's the young people who keep us from getting cynical and despairing," said Mitchell. "It's always important to critique the system, but teaching is not just about deconstruction. Doom and gloom isn't helpful. We have to give students avenues, aspirations, visions of what they can do. We have to let their imaginations soar."</p>
<p>Alumni have to step up, too, she said: "They need to value us and the fabulous education they got at this public university. They need to be loud and clear about the value of what they learned."</p>
<p>Mitchell, who credits great staff with allowing her to "hit the ground running," said her top priority this year is to launch a social sciences research institute to raise the profile of the division. Led by a faculty director and a staff assistant director, the institute will provide financial support to faculty and students, host events, and share research results broadly with academic and non-academic audiences. An executive board made up of faculty will govern the institute, which Mitchell hopes will be fielding proposals by Spring Quarter.</p>
<p>"The social sciences are the core of the campus," Mitchell told the audience during the division's recent annual fall breakfast, when she announced the institute. "We are the lifeblood that connects and sustains this place. We will develop strategic themes over time. Our social justice mandate is our heritage and our comparative advantage."</p>

For the past 400 years, a debate has raged among critics and scholars over whether or not it is anti-Semitic.
<p>The play is both lauded and loathed, depending on who you talk to.</p>
<p>As writer Stephen Greenblatt wrote in a recent <em>New Yorker</em> magazine piece titled <em>Shakespeare&#8217;s Cure for Xenophobia: What &#8216;The Merchant of Venice&#8217; taught me about ethnic hatred and the literary imagination, </em>&#8220;Even now, more than four centuries later, the unsettling that the play provokes remains a beautiful and disturbing experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, November 7, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute for Humanities Research will bring Karin Coonrod, the founding director of Italy&#8217;s Compagnia de&#8217; Colombari theater company, to the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History for a public discussion of her groundbreaking production of <em>The Merchant of Venice, </em>staged last year in the Venice Ghetto.</p>
<p>The panel will also include Nathaniel Deutsch, history professor and director of the Center for Jewish Studies at UC Santa Cruz; and Sean Keilen, professor of literature and director of Shakespeare Workshop in the Humanities Division at UCSC.</p>
<p>Mike Ryan, artistic director of Santa Cruz Shakespeare, will additionally provide opening remarks about the history of <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> in Santa Cruz. And Coonrod will be introduced by UCSC emeritus humanities professor Murray Baumgarten, who has conducted extensive research on site at the Venice Ghetto.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe that the play is anti-Semitic,&#8221; said Keilen. &#8220;I believe that it uses anti-Semitic rhetoric, along with some very sobering criticism of Christian hypocrisy and early capitalism, to suggest where the fault lines in a pluralistic society might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Karin Coonrod&#8217;s production of <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>&#160;was the first production of the play in the Venice Ghetto, timed to coincide with the 500th anniversary of the Ghetto's creation and the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death,&#8221; Keilen noted. &#8220;It was very well received in Venice. Partly on the strength of that reception, she has been able to bring her production to the east coast this fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keilen added that he sees the play as a key text for deciding how to be free and just in today&#8217;s global society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shakespeare's Venice is a multicultural society and a society in which economic thinking is pervasive, so much so that Shakespeare's characters don't seem to be able to think about the value of a human life or of relationships between people without thinking about money,&#8221; said Keilen.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons why I am drawn to the play is that Shakespeare asks to consider whether a pluralistic society would be better off with another value system, a system in which value itself is not monetized, or whether the society that he imagines in Venice is actually the best that we can hope for.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, money seems to trivialize human bonds and commodify precisely those experiences that we describe as priceless--love most of all. On the other hand, money in the play provides a language and medium in which characters of very different points of view are able to find common ground and enter into exchanges with each other.&#8221;</p>

Now a distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, Griggs has published two new books this year.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520293625">Coasts in Crisis: A Global Challenge</a></em> (UC Press, September 2017) dives headfirst into the geological and historical conditions that have brought three billion people to occupy and exploit the world&#8217;s dynamic coastlines. According to Griggs, sea level rise may be the greatest challenge human civilizations have ever faced globally.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Edge.html?id=zF6ZAQAACAAJ"><em>The Edge: The Pressured Past and Precarious Future of California&#8217;s Coast</em></a> (Craven Press, October 2017) Griggs and coauthor Kim Steinhardt explore California&#8217;s captivating coastal edge from past to present and look ahead to its uncertain future. The book shines light on how climate change, fisheries, petroleum industries, and coastal development intertwine to transform coastal communities, and it explains how decisions made today will shape the coasts of tomorrow.</p>
<p>These are the ninth and 10th books Griggs has published in a long-running effort to raise public awareness of issues involving the oceans and coasts. He also writes a regular column, &#8220;Our Ocean Backyard,&#8221; for the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>. A side project that Griggs originally believed would last for only a few months, the column is now on its ninth year.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you write the right thing at the right time you can have a profound impact,&#8221; Griggs said. &#8220;Writing for the <em>Sentinel</em> for the past nine years has been fun. It taught me how to write so the public can understand.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sea level rise</strong></p>
<p>The threat of sea level rise, driven by climate change, as well as the growing populations concentrated in coastal areas are central concerns of<em> Coasts in Crisis. </em>The global average sea level is expected to be one foot higher by 2050 and will likely be three to five feet higher by 2100, leading to unprecedented levels of coastal flooding, erosion, and storm damage. Sea level rise intensifies the impacts of storm surge, making short-term weather events more dangerous, as seen in the devastation and lives lost from Hurricane Katrina (2005), &#8220;superstorm&#8221; Sandy (2012), and this year&#8217;s hurricanes Harvey and Irma.</p>
<p>In addition to opening readers&#8217; eyes to the many natural hazards that impact the hundreds of millions of people living within three feet of the high-tide line, <em>Coasts in Crisis </em>offers recommendations at the end of each chapter for how governments and individuals can take action. The book also addresses the impacts of civil engineering tools such as seawalls used to protect property from erosion, desalination for drinking water, use of seawater to cool coastal power plants, and coastal wind farms for harvesting renewable energy.</p>
<p>People love the coasts for their beauty and recreational opportunities, but they are also where people dump waste and extract resources. &#8220;The ocean has a memory, and you can&#8217;t just keep dumping and expect it not to respond,&#8221; Griggs said. &#8220;Corals are dying as the ocean is becoming more acidic. We need to be aware of those impacts. It is a global issue.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Lifelong connections</strong></p>
<p><em>The Edge </em>is more recent and more personal than <em>Coasts in Crisis</em>. The first two chapters touch on the authors&#8217; childhoods and lifelong connections to the coast, but the book still has a hard-nosed focus on coastal challenges, both past and present. Subjects include early and recent human migration, offshore drilling, fishing, and neighborhoods lost to the ever-eroding edge that is California&#8217;s coastline. The book looks back in history at political clashes over protection of the coastal environment and at the policies that have made California a model to the world for coastal protection.</p>
<p>Griggs&#8217;s friend and coauthor Kim Steinhardt is a retired administrative judge with years of coastal policy experience and a particular interest in sea otter conservation. Steinhardt is also an accomplished photographer whose pictures have appeared in <em>National Geographic</em> children&#8217;s books. <em>The Edge </em>has 125 captivating images of California&#8217;s expansive, changing coastlines and diverse wildlife, including many of Steinhardt&#8217;s wildlife photos and Griggs&#8217;s pictures documenting geological processes and hazards.</p>
<p><em>The Edge</em> illustrates how California came to be such an important edge, where early human populations and later European immigrants found abundant resources, including fish and wildlife thriving in the rich coastal waters. It chronicles the boom and bust cycles of California&#8217;s fisheries, the erosion of sand from beaches, and the uncertain recovery of the sea otter population. At the same time, the book&#8217;s personal approach forced Griggs and Steinhardt to talk more deeply about their understanding and appreciation of the coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a personal piece, more so than my other books,&#8221; Griggs said. &#8220;To have two books come out in one year, well, it just happened that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Griggs and Steinhardt will discuss <em>The Edge</em> in a public talk and book signing at the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> on Friday, November 3, from 6:30 to 8 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5aa98ba4807270175d9801f1b9a600c9"><name>halloween-students</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Halloween, October 31st and days prior</title><summary>On behalf of the university and the City of Santa Cruz, I encourage you to avoid downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night and instead choose to be on campus in order to participate in one or more of the many programs offered throughout our college and residential communities.</summary><start-date>1509001200000</start-date><display-name>Halloween, October 31st and days prior</display-name><path>/2017/10/halloween-students</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/halloween-students</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1509054580637</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1509054580637</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I hope this message finds you well as we approach fall mid-terms. One of my roles as associate vice chancellor for Colleges, Housing and Educational Services is to provide you with information that helps you to make safe choices. You should find the information below useful as you plan how and where to spend your time on Halloween this year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>On behalf of the university and the City of Santa Cruz, I encourage you to avoid downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night and instead choose to be on campus in order to participate in one or more of the many programs offered throughout our college and residential communities. Please see <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2017/2017-10-20.html">http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2017/2017-10-20.html</a> for a list of programs hosted on campus. In past years on Halloween, the downtown has been marred by incidents of violence, including stabbings. Out of concern for community members who may unintentionally become victims of violence, the City of Santa Cruz takes a no tolerance stance toward those that would disrupt the community&#8217;s safety.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Like the City of Santa Cruz, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department also enforces a no tolerance policy in regard to unlawful, disruptive and/or dangerous behavior, and will deploy appropriate staff to deal with any issues that arise. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and allied law enforcement agencies will forward information to Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards those students engaged in unlawful, disruptive and/or dangerous behavior. Additional community safety officers (CSOs) will also be deployed throughout the campus&#8217;s residential areas. Please be mindful and respectful of all campus policies, rules, and regulations. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>CALL 911: Do not hesitate to report any suspicious activity or behavior by dialing 911 (on campus you may also dial 831/459-2231, ext 1). In addition, if you feel that someone is suffering from substance poisoning or other medical emergency, dial 911 immediately. Timely calls to 911 save lives.</strong></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>If, however, you do choose to go downtown, please be advised:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Friday and Saturday nights preceding Halloween, UCSC will operate Night Owl buses on their regular schedule from downtown Santa Cruz (Cathcart Street) approximately every 20 minutes from 11:30pm until 2:10am. CSOs will be riding these buses to assist in identifying any individuals that are clearly intoxicated and cannot care for themselves or others. These individuals will not be allowed onto the bus, and Police and/or Fire may be summoned to assess individuals.</li>
<li>On Halloween Night, Tuesday 10/31/17, UCSC will operate Night Owl buses from downtown Santa Cruz (near 511 Cedar Street) approximately every 20 minutes from 11:30pm until a last departure from downtown at 12:50am. SCMTD Metro buses will operate on their regular service schedule Tuesday night, Oct. 31, with the last Route 16 bus departing downtown at 12:07am to reach Science Hill at 12:25am before returning downtown at 12:47am.</li>
<li>Bus service from the downtown area may be limited and you may find yourself walking back up to campus. Should you have to walk back to campus, please remember to be good neighbors (i.e., respect the city noise ordinance, traffic laws and the property of others). Try to walk home with others as it can be very dark along several sections of the route back to campus.</li>
<li>Be advised that the downtown area has been designated a &#8220;triple fine&#8221; area for violations of city ordinances beginning on Monday, Oct. 30 and extending through the early hours of Wednesday, Nov. 1. Should you be involved in any incident for which you are cited by the City of Santa Cruz Police, you will also be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for possible university judicial action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our colleagues from SHOP at the Student Health Center have provided tips for a safe Halloween both on and off campus. Please visit the SHOP News tab on the following website for more information:</p>
<p><a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu/">http://shop.ucsc.edu/</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the City of Santa Cruz Police Department has asked the university to share the following with students:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>If you are planning to come to downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night, we ask that you have fun and behave responsibly. With the well-being of our residents and visitors in mind, the City has concentrated resources downtown to promote a safe environment that everyone can enjoy. This includes over 100 law enforcement officers from 9 agencies patrolling the downtown corridor and triple fines for certain violations of the Municipal Code. Triple fines and court costs make an alcoholic open container violation total $480, and littering almost $300.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#160;</em></p>
<p>For your reference, information regarding the triple fine zone in the City of Santa Cruz is available at:<br/> <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2017/pdf/Halloween-downtown-regulations2017.pdf">http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2017/pdf/Halloween-downtown-regulations2017.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I hope that you have a fun and safe Halloween.</p>

<p>The goal of the project is to provide a fun and immersive community experience.</p>
<p>Current sites include Soquel Drive at Chanticleer Avenue, near the Sutter Surgery Center, until Nov. 15; and Natural Bridges at the railroad crossing near the Wrigley Building, until Nov. 29.</p>
<p>The visualizations use on-site viewers to demonstrate transportation and land use options that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize use of existing streets through enhanced bicycle, pedestrian and transit facilities to address congestion</li>
<li>Expand safe mobility options for all members of the community</li>
<li>Include options that decrease greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle miles traveled and help meet state pollution-reduction mandates</li>
<li>Provide walk-friendly, compact, mixed-use neighborhoods</li>
<li>Encourage options that decrease personal transportation expenses thereby increasing the amount of money that can be reinvested in the local economy</li>
<li>Reflect projects approved by voters in Measure D, projects in city and county plans and community priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants can provide feedback about the short and long term visualizations via a short survey on the viewer. Each visual will also be accessible through an app for smart phones, computers, or other devices. The app is available at www.sccrtc.org/vis.</p>
<p>For more information, please visit the project website at www.sccrtc.org/vis. People can sign up to get project updates by sending an email to info@sccrtc.org with &#8220;Vis&#8221; in the subject line.</p>
<p>The Sustainable Transportation Visualization for Santa Cruz County project was funded through a Caltrans Transit Planning for Sustainable Communities grant to help meet the state goal of expanded accessibility and multimodal options.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6f9be489807270175d9801f161bc71ae"><name>barn-talk</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Talk with the architect: Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</title><summary>On Wednesday evening, November 8, architect, UC Santa Cruz alumnus and Professor Emeritus of architecture Richard Fernau will speak about his office’s renovation/reinvention of the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn.</summary><start-date>1509346800000</start-date><display-name>Barn-talk</display-name><path>/2017/10/barn-talk</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/barn-talk</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1509406007395</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1509406090165</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/barn-lit-up.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/barn-lit-up.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barn-lit-up.jpg</name><display-name>barn-lit-up.jpg</display-name><file-size>63288</file-size><width>310</width><height>232</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/barn-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/barn-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>barn-80.jpg</name><display-name>barn-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6778</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Cowell Ranch Hay Barn</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Cowell Ranch Hay Barn at UC Santa Cruz.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On Wednesday evening, November 8, architect, UC Santa Cruz alumnus and Professor Emeritus of architecture Richard Fernau will speak about his office&#8217;s renovation/reinvention of the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn in the context of his recently published book,<span>&#160;</span><em>Improvisations on the Land: the Houses of Fernau &amp; Hartman.</em><span>&#160;</span>The event takes place at the Hay Barn, with a reception beginning at 6 p.m. and the presentation at 7 p.m.</p>

This is the fourth year </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has published its global rankings.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/university-of-california-santa-cruz-110714"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz at No. 47</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joins five other UC campuses in the top 50. Berkeley was highest at No. 4 in the world followed by UCLA (13), UCSF (15), UC San Diego (16), and UC Santa Barbara (28). Close behind are Davis (52) and Irvine (75).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rankings focus on the publication of academic research and on reputation. "The schools that rank the highest in the Best Global Universities rankings are those that emphasize academic research, including by partnering with international scholars to produce highly cited articles," said Robert Morse, chief data strategist at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz ranked third in the world for the percentage of highly cited papers that are among the top 1 percent most cited. The campus was fourth for the percentage of total publications that are among the top 10 percent most cited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is listed at 13</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for international collaboration besides being fifth in the world in space sciences. <br/></span></p>

Rather than bringing students into faculty research labs, where only a limited number can be accommodated, Sanford is bringing his research program into the laboratory classroom.</p>
<p>Sanford's Undergraduate Biomedical Research Initiative is a pilot program launched this quarter with 35 students in a new class that provides research experience while fulfilling laboratory course requirements for majors in the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental (MCD) Biology. The students will be working on projects directly connected to Sanford's research on disease-causing genetic mutations.</p>
<p>"We're taking them out of the cookbook-style lab classes and putting them in a research lab where they can do hypothesis-driven experiments," said Sanford, an associate professor of MCD biology. "It's going to be super cool."</p>
<p>The benefits for undergraduates of hands-on experience in a faculty research lab are well documented, and UC Santa Cruz has many programs that support undergraduate research. Finding a spot in a lab can be hard, though, especially in departments with large numbers of students. MCD biology, for example, has more than 2,000 students in its majors and only about 25 faculty with active research labs.</p>
<p>"We want to make it easy for all students to get research experience," said department chair William Saxton, professor of MCD biology. "We have so many students in biology, a lot of classes have hundreds of students in them. It's important for undergraduates to go beyond the kind of learning they do in those large classes. The research lab is a way to pass on high-level skills and provide the training students need to get a job."</p>
<p>Crucial funding to get the new lab course off the ground was provided by a gift from UCSC alumnus George Kraw and his wife, Raphael. Sanford first connected with Kraw through their shared enthusiasm for rugby--Sanford serves as a volunteer coach for the men's rugby team, and Kraw, who played on UCSC's first team in 1967, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/field-lights.html">donated funds to provide stadium lights</a> for the team's practices. Their new gift earlier this year included funds for the equipment and materials needed to set up Sanford's undergraduate research laboratory in the Sinsheimer Laboratories building.</p>
<p>Industry partners could provide ongoing funding to expand and sustain the initiative in the long run, Sanford said. "Funding is always a challenge, and I think the solution is to partner with the biotechnology industry," he said. "I'm working to build a consortium of companies to provide funding and internships for the students. The companies are interested because competition for talent is fierce and these students will be able to hit the ground running, already trained to think like a scientist and work in a lab."</p>
<p>Sanford studies proteins that regulate gene expression, the roles such proteins play in cancer, and disease-causing mutations that disrupt their normal activities. The students in his lab class will be working to characterize many of the disease-related mutations that Sanford's lab has identified in previous research.</p>
<p>"These kids could make some important discoveries, and that's exciting," Saxton said. Eventually, he noted, other faculty could set up similar undergraduate research labs based on their own research programs and integrated into the MCD Biology curriculum.</p>
<p>In 2009, with funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, MCD Biology launched a phage genomics course that also provides hands-on research experience. Grant Hartzog, who initially taught the course along with fellow MCD biology professor Manuel Ares, said Sanford's course is similar in that each student has ownership of their own research problem, but there are also important differences.</p>
<p>"One nice thing is that it's related to Jeremy's research, so students can see that they are contributing to a larger research project," Hartzog said. "Also, he's designed it so that once it's up and running there will be students at different levels, so the more experienced students can help those with less experience. And he's forging connections to the larger Bay Area biotechnology community, which will enrich students' experiences and perspectives."</p>
<p>Hartzog cautioned that Sanford may not realize how demanding it is to teach a course like this, but Sanford said he'd rather work harder teaching the lab course than give lectures to classes with 350 students. And Saxton said he's been impressed by Sanford's energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"We have the equipment, we have the funding, and we have a guy who's energetic enough to make it go," Saxton said. "Jeremy is a real asset for the department and for the campus."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7370f957807270175d9801f1a71d9797"><name>update-student-housing-west</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Progress made on Student Housing West</title><summary>By Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services — We have selected Capstone Development Partners as our preferred developer to deliver the project, and they have been working alongside UC Santa Cruz team members in developing building siting, density and program adjacencies. </summary><start-date>1509433200000</start-date><display-name>Campus housing</display-name><path>/2017/10/update-student-housing-west</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/update-student-housing-west</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1509470303539</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1509476401235</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sarah Latham</name><title>Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</title><phone/><email>sclatham@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/latham_sarah-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/latham_sarah-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>latham_sarah-400.jpg</name><display-name>latham_sarah-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>117100</file-size><width>400</width><height>271</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <a href="../05/keynote-latham-housing.xml">Student Housing West project</a> continues to progress. The project, which will deliver 3,000 beds to campus by 2022, includes housing for upper-division undergraduates, graduate students, students with families, and child care. This project is critical in addressing the need for more on-campus housing.</p>
<p>We have selected Capstone Development Partners as our preferred developer to deliver the project, and they have been working alongside UC Santa Cruz team members in developing building siting, density and program adjacencies. Collegiate Housing Foundation has been selected to serve as the non-profit owner of the development.</p>
<p>When the Student Housing West project was launched, there were several objectives shared with development teams vying to deliver the project. With an overarching goal of advancing affordability, the objectives continue to guide work as we have moved into project siting and design, and include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for student development, student retention, and academic success</li>
<li>Maximization of creativity in addressing planning, design, and implementation challenges</li>
<li>Creation of inclusive communities for a diverse student population</li>
<li>Development of housing communities that support a student experience consistent with that of students living in campus owned and operated housing communities</li>
<li>Advancement of university sustainability goals and minimization of environmental impacts from facilities and operations</li>
<li>Accommodation of the diverse needs of upper division students, graduate students, and students with families and provision of high density neighboring adjacencies conducive to communal living</li>
<li>Sensitivity to the natural environment in the siting of buildings, infrastructure, and open spaces</li>
<li>Enhancement of connectivity between the west and larger campus networks with pathways for pedestrian, bicycle, shuttle, and vehicular transportation</li>
<li>Utilization of life-cycle cost metrics, a total cost of ownership framework, and a robust, comprehensive financial plan to ensure the longevity and quality of facilities and systems</li>
</ul>
<p>As work has evolved on the project, so too has the thinking on the best location for family student housing and child care. It was announced at the end of 2016 that, as part of the new housing project, child care would be expanded to accommodate the children of employees. A revised approach to siting has emerged as a way to maximize project objectives, including those outlined above. The revised plan will shift family student housing and child care to a site off of Hagar Drive near the base of campus. In addition to advancing project objectives, it also moves child care to a location more proximate and accessible to employees living on campus.</p>
<p>We have been conducting several stakeholder engagement sessions in recent weeks. For those who would like to learn more, we are hosting two open town halls on November 1st:</p>
<ul>
<li>1&#8211;2 p.m. at Kresge Town Hall</li>
<li>7&#8211;8 p.m. at Oakes Learning Center</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The divisions of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement prepare low-income, first generation students for postsecondary education, work to expand the diversity of our undergraduate student body at UC Santa Cruz, and seek to offer experiences that challenge students intellectually and personally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week, some of this work was on display when Chancellor George Blumenthal spoke to hundreds of students at Pajaro Valley High School, as part of the </span><a href="http://achieve.universityofcalifornia.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieve UC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative. &#160;Accompanied by a team from the Educational Partnership Center, the chancellor </span><a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20171025/NEWS/171029794"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told a gym full of students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a UC education is affordable and attainable, and that they need to submit their UC application by Nov. 30. He joined a panel discussion about college life and even took a moment to read an aspiring astrophysicist&#8217;s essay for their UC Santa Cruz application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieve UC and many more outreach efforts are run by our </span><a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational Partnership Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EPC), which just received a $10.5 million </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/grant-epc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Education to further build upon the existing college-bound communities in south Monterey County, joining existing programs and collaborations in the Pajaro Valley as well as Santa Clara, North Monterey, and Santa Cruz counties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this work points to the partnerships, among schools, businesses, foundations, and governments, to continuously build the pipeline to college and future success. Developing a diverse class relies on connecting early and broadly to students to ensure their greatest success, and on bringing together experiences from places near and far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a diverse class also deeply involves our faculty. We work closely with the </span><a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic Senate&#8217;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid (CAFA) to set local admissions strategies that help us to form a new undergraduate class from more than 60,000 applications. These strategies guide our efforts to recruit and enroll California transfer students, California high school students, students from out of California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://admissions.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office of Undergraduate Admissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in collaboration with other staff, faculty, students and alumni, has been an instrumental partner in the campus&#8217;s success in improving campus diversity. Now, 4 percent of undergraduates identify as African American, and 1 percent as American Indian. Further, beyond California, 3 percent are from 44 states and Puerto Rico, and 6 percent from 40 countries other than the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers, still small and needing to grow, enrich the campus experience for everyone by bringing in more experiences, cultures, and skills.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Banana Slugs abroad</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After students arrive on campus, we also strive to diversify the experiences they have throughout their undergraduate career and ensure an inclusive campus environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, I joined a systemwide meeting focussed on &#8220;getting to 30 percent&#8221;, doubling undergraduate participation in </span><a href="https://studyabroad.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">international study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, research, and internship. Perhaps surprisingly, this is a challenging goal!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, just 14 percent of our graduates had had some international educational experience after joining our campus, and 3 percent before joining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other strategies, we are building new relationships with universities abroad, and helping create new opportunities for </span><a href="https://studyabroad.ucsc.edu/faculty/facultyproposal.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz faculty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to teach courses and take students abroad. These integrated campus-led programs should increase opportunities for students from groups less represented in study abroad, as will our general work to enhance opportunities and accessibility to study abroad for all UC Santa Cruz students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement also work extensively with units and divisions throughout campus to ensure all students feel welcome and respected. </span><a href="https://orientation.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orientation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/summer-academies/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Academies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://isss.ucsc.edu/students/newlyadmitted/orientation/globalstart.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Start</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/campus/colleges.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learning communities, the </span><a href="https://firstgen.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Generation Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the new diversity training are just the early launch-points of work on campus climate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nearly $20 million Environmental Health and Safety Facility&#8212;funded by the state through the UC Office of the President&#8212;will help ensure the campus continues to comply with state and federal regulations. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7,300</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-square-foot building will be built adjacent to Heller Road, just south of the Kerr Hall pedestrian bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction on the facility is expected to start in November and end in December 2018. Like all campus buildings, architects have designed the facility to blend in with the natural landscape and carefully site the building around groves of trees so as to minimize the number of trees removed for the building and accompanying driveways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, lab waste is directed to two different interim facilities, one on Science Hill and one at the base of campus. This project will consolidate the management into one site. Patrick Goff, executive director of Environmental Health &amp; Safety and the Office of Emergency Services, said all other UC campuses, except Merced, have built similar facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The facility will be used to manage chemical waste and low-level radioactive waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has instructors and researchers in the life sciences, physical sciences, and fine arts who use chemicals in their work and generate waste that needs processing and disposal. In addition, chemicals are used to help maintain the campus. Chemical waste is packaged and labeled by trained researchers and staff, and is collected once a week to bring it to the holding facility. Within 90 days, a licensed contractor transports the chemical waste to an approved and permitted treatment, storage, and disposal facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, some researchers in the life sciences and physical sciences use low-level radioactive materials to carry out experiments and educate students on certain techniques. The campus annually receives less than 100 milliliters&#8212;or less than 3 ounces&#8212;of radioactive material for research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural radiation is all around us. For example, living in Santa Cruz exposes a person to about 647 millirem of radiation every year. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, can expose a person to much more. A pack a day adds up to about 25,000 millirem in a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC's radiation workers, including researchers and staff handling radioactive waste, typically receive doses below 10 mrem per year from their work.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7437ecb4807270175d9801f199386d6f"><name>olsen</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fishing physician</title><summary>Alumnus Greg Olsen not only leads a successful medical practice, but also a booming commercial fishing business</summary><author>J.D.

For Greg Olsen, leading a successful medical practice was just a start. <br/><br/>Olsen (Rachel Carson &#8216;80, biology) also runs a booming commercial fishing business. <br/><br/>His tendency to buck norms was apparent when he was a teenager. He tested out of high school early, enrolled at Santa Barbara City College, and moved to a cottage near the beach. He&#8217;d wake up at 5 a.m. each day and check the ocean. <br/><br/>&#8220;If there was surf, then I&#8217;d surf. If there wasn&#8217;t surf, I&#8217;d come back and study,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I was a long-haired hippie surfer egghead.&#8221; <br/>
<h3>Rockin&#8217; surf town</h3>
The surfer hippie egghead soon realized he wanted to become a doctor and transferred to UC Santa Cruz. At the time the university didn&#8217;t issue grades. To Olsen that &#8220;implied education for the sake of knowledge.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;It also really appealed that it was a rocking surf town,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Not to mention the campus&#8212;I mean, oh my God!&#8221;<br/><br/>As an avid student he liked the fact that professors, not graduate students, led classes. <br/><br/>&#8220;I learned so many amazing things there. I felt there was such a solid emphasis on teaching.&#8221; <br/><br/>Ironically, when he graduated, medical schools didn&#8217;t immediately respond to his gradeless applications. He was about to give up and make an epic surfing expedition.<br/><br/>&#8220;I was packed for Central America and I wasn&#8217;t coming back,&#8221; Olsen says.<br/><br/>His acceptance letter from the Medical College of Wisconsin arrived just in time to interrupt his emigration.<br/>
<h3>&#8220;Valhalla moment&#8221;</h3>
After medical school, he was practicing in Santa Barbara and took an invitation to substitute in the emergency room. He calls that shift a &#8220;Valhalla moment.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;After that first day I came with the realization that this is what I want to do for my entire life,&#8221; Olsen says. <br/><br/>Being an ER doctor allows him to meet a &#8220;totally unselected slice of humanity,&#8220; and support them as they face extraordinary drama.<br/><br/>He recounts the story of a recent patient whose heart stopped on the finish line of a marathon. Paramedics resuscitated her and rushed her to the ER, but when he finished his shift, she appeared to have no brain function.<br/><br/>&#8220;The critical care doctors called me back two days later and said, &#8216;Guess who&#8217;s sitting up talking,&#8217;&#8221; Olsen says.<br/><br/>He found the woman he had not expected to recover in a room surrounded by her family. When he entered and explained he had been her ER doctor, everyone in the room started weeping. <br/><br/>&#8220;Who gets to do that?&#8221; he says. &#8220;We lose a lot of battles. Sometimes we win and people get up and walk away and go back to the people they love.&#8221;
<h3>The Romance Ward</h3>
The hospital was where he met supermodel Kathy Ireland. Ireland is now CEO, chair, and chief designer for the fashion and home furnishings company kathy ireland Worldwide. <br/><br/>She was there for lunch with her mother, who was a nurse. They were standing outside the psychiatric ward, and according to Ireland, &#8220;this gorgeous guy walked by and he caught us looking at him.&#8221; So her mother introduced them. <br/><br/>&#8220;I proceeded to stalk him for two months,&#8221; she says.<br/><br/>They now have three children, one of whom was just married. Ireland and Olsen celebrate their 29th wedding anniversary this year.<br/><br/>Now Olsen calls the psychiatric ward &#8220;the Romance Ward.&#8221; <br/><br/>Ireland says Olsen is &#8220;more awesome&#8221; now than when they met. She says unlike many doctors who become detached from their patients&#8217; struggles, her husband gets emotionally involved.<br/><br/>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go to the store without somebody stopping me and saying, &#8216;Your husband was my son's doctor. My little boy was so scared, and he just took the fear away.&#8217;&#8221; <br/>
<h3>Hooked on fishing</h3>

</figure>
In 2007, Olsen bought a commercial license to fish for lobster. He had been enjoying fishing recreationally and thought going into business would allow him to spend more time on the boat. He ended up making more money than he would have practicing medicine for the same period. Now he&#8217;s been running the business for ten years. <br/><br/>His ability to succeed in two completely opposite careers at once came as no surprise to Ireland. Her husband learned a great work ethic in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s self-directed environment. <br/><br/>As he dove into fishing, Ireland says, Olsen displayed a youthful ability to continue learning. He taught himself to weld. He built lobster traps, testing them by dropping them from the second story of their house. <br/><br/>She also attributes his drive to his Christian faith, which characteristically Olsen arrived at via an uncommon path.<br/><br/>Olsen calls religion &#8220;arguably one of the most destructive forces mankind has ever devised.&#8221; He became interested in Christianity when he realized Jesus agreed.<br/><br/>Instead, he says, Jesus &#8220;stood for love, forgiveness, and charity.&#8221; He draws on that inspiration to approach his patients as a servant, &#8220;to frolic in the surf with the heart of a child, to spend countless hours in solitude reflecting on the unending beauty of the world, to approach fearsome circumstances with courage and confidence.&#8221;<br/><br/>Olsen says he approaches life as if it&#8217;s full of moments you can either take advantage of or allow to slip by. That includes the impulse to start a career wholly different from the one he&#8217;d trained for.<br/><br/>&#8220;It turned out it was something I wanted to do my whole life. There are some of us who are just supposed to be on the sea,&#8221; he says. &#8220;One of the biggest tragedies you can have in your life is to be in your later years and look back and feel that you have not fulfilled your purpose or your passions.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="78554aaa807270175d9801f1eedab0ad"><name>open-enrollment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Open Enrollment 2018</title><summary>The annual Open Enrollment (OE) period begins today (Thursday, October. 26) at 8:00 a.m., and ends at 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November. 21.</summary><start-date>1509001200000</start-date><display-name>Open Enrollment 2018</display-name><path>/2017/10/open-enrollment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/open-enrollment</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1509552375456</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1509552375456</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The annual Open Enrollment (OE) period begins today (Thursday, October. 26) at 8:00 a.m., and ends at 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, November. 21. Changes made become effective January 1, 2018. This is the time of year to review your health and welfare benefits, decide whether to make any changes, and enroll or re-enroll in a flexible spending account (FSA) for the 2018 plan year.&#160;</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>OE Booklets were mailed to home addresses this week. If you haven't received a booklet or were hired after September 14, 2017 you can contact the campus Benefits Office for a copy. Call 831-459-2013. All Open Enrollment information is <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/">also online</a>.&#160; Follow the links to 2018 Open Enrollment information.&#160;</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>While there are few benefit changes to our health plans this year, it is always a good idea to review the Open Enrollment booklet and consider all of your available choices. System-wide, the same suite of plans available in 2017 will continue in 2018.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>The Office of the President worked diligently to hold down costs for faculty and staff while continuing to provide a full array of plan choices. Most employees will see an increase of less than $10 in their monthly premiums. Premium increases for UC Care will be a bit higher, ranging from $17-$53 a month. The plan premiums <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs-2018.html">can be found online</a>. In addition, the University will continue to cover 100 percent of the premium cost for the vision and dental plans for employees and dependents.&#160;</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>Some other 2018 changes include:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>All four pay bands have been adjusted upward.<span>&#160; </span></li>
<li>UC&#8217;s PPO medical plans, UC Care, UC Health Savings Plan and Core, will continue to be administered by Anthem Blue Cross.</li>
<li>Anthem will provide prescription drug coverage for members of the PPO plans beginning in 2018 instead of Optum Rx. The behavioral health network for our PPOs plans will continue to be Anthem Blue Cross</li>
<li>ARAG (legal plan) will have a slight increase (less than 60 cents/month), will add benefits related to real estate and family law and is open for enrollment.&#160;</li>
<li>Employee Supplemental Life and Dependent Basic and Expanded Life and Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) premium rates remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes and other information are detailed in the OE information found in your OE Booklet and on-line at <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/oe/</a>&#160;</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>The UCSC Benefits Office will also provide the campus with a number of OE presentations. The schedule is below and will be available at the <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/Open%20Enrollment1/index.html">UCSC SHR website</a>.&#160;</p>

<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>UC continues to offer several medical plans to choose from. Each plan provides comprehensive coverage, including behavioral health benefits. But the cost, both in terms of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as provider choice and flexibility to use out-of-network doctors and hospitals, varies significantly. And if you plan to retire during 2018, please remember that the medical plan that you choose will carry into retirement, in most cases.&#160;</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>Please take time to review your 2017 options and choose the medical plan that best fits your needs. If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation. For individual assistance, please contact the campus Benefits Office at 831-459-2013.</p>

<p>El calendario de Inscripci&#243;n abierta para JUBILADOS est&#225; en el sitio web de la Oficina de Beneficios.</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>UC contin&#250;a ofreciendo varios planes m&#233;dicos entre los que puede escoger. Cada plan proporciona cobertura amplia, que incluye los beneficios de salud conductual. Sin embargo, tanto el costo en t&#233;rminos de primas y gastos de desembolso directo (de su bolsillo) como la opci&#243;n de proveedor y flexibilidad de usar m&#233;dicos y hospitales fuera de la red var&#237;a significativamente. Adem&#225;s, si tiene planificado jubilarse durante 2018, recuerde que el plan m&#233;dico que elija continuar&#225; en la jubilaci&#243;n en la mayor&#237;a de los casos.&#160;</p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p>Le recomendamos que dedique el tiempo para revisar sus opciones de 2017 y elegir el plan m&#233;dico m&#225;s adecuado para sus necesidades. Si tiene alguna pregunta o necesita ayuda con sus decisiones para la inscripci&#243;n, considere asistir a una presentaci&#243;n de la Inscripci&#243;n abierta. Para ayuda individual, comun&#237;quese con la Oficina de Beneficios del campus llamando al 831-459-2013.</p>

This is your chance to help shape the future of our campus. This process will enable us to describe the university&#8217;s unique strengths&#8212;and to identify our unique opportunities. Articulating our character and our goals for the future will not only help UC Santa Cruz advance, but can leverage our strengths to take a leadership role in shaping the future of higher education.</p>
<p>This effort will be different from Envision, completed nearly three years ago. Great work went into Envision, which was a strategic campus plan, not an academic one. We now need to identify, and then highlight and energize, academic areas that will strengthen the university as a whole, allowing us to build stronger programs for students, create new research opportunities for faculty, and strengthen our global impact.</p>
<p>Together, we will identify the major themes that make UC Santa Cruz the truly remarkable place that it is. We have developed pathbreaking programs on this campus. We have one of the most cited and powerhouse faculties in the world. We are ranked in the top 50 of thousands of universities. Identifying and building upon those things that make us uniquely who we are will improve our capacity to recruit faculty and students, capture extramural funding, and find donors who want to invest in our programs, our faculty, our students, and our future. We might, for example, decide to highlight global health, the coastal environment and climate, or social justice. Our community will identify the areas. Investing strategically will allow us to utilize our resources in the most meaningful ways and will enable UC Santa Cruz to grow its impact.</p>
<p>This week, we finalized a contract with a consulting group that will help guide us. The group specializes in seeing the process through to goal setting and execution. I have pulled together a small group of leaders who will shepherd the process. Please be prepared, in the months that follow, to respond to our call to campus constituents. Your input will be vital to making the academic plan reflective of the true depth and excitement of UC Santa Cruz, and I want all of your voices engaged. We will develop a five-year plan that sets a clear vision for the future of academics at UC Santa Cruz and outlines concrete steps to move the campus forward.</p>
<p>Our timeline is ambitious but achievable. We will spend this academic year drafting the plan, and the 2018-19 academic year launching its implementation.</p>
<p>I am genuinely excited to learn how our community will set a course. Through interviews and scoping sessions with faculty, staff and students, we will identify our existing strengths, the needs of our students and of our state, and unmet opportunities. Then together we will set clear priorities.</p>
<p>This is important work that has the power to set UC Santa Cruz on a powerful upward trajectory, and I hope you all will join me in it.</p>

He credits his piano teacher at UCSC, Mary Jane Cope, and her husband of Professor Emeritus of Music, David Cope, for presenting him with a new way of thinking about music that ultimately set him in the direction that has taken him to the incredible place he is now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized when I got to UC Santa Cruz how most of the other piano students were so much more advanced than me,&#8221; says Klyce.&#160;"I went in thinking I was good, but quickly realized how many students were obviously far better and more talented.&#160;It was an adjustment for me to make as a musician. When you think of something as your skill set -- and then you realize it&#8217;s not&#8230;you don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re really cut out for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But making that profound, though tough, discovery didn&#8217;t diminish Klyce&#8217;s love of music. He really appreciates how being at UCSC enabled him to have many inspiring teachers who showed him a new way to express his talent.</p>
<h3>"I had wonderful teachers"</h3>
<p>He credits Professors Gordon Mumma and David Cope with introducing him to Music Concr&#232;te:&#160;a 1940's genre of music that was in many ways, like sound design. &#8220;I had wonderful teachers!&#160;Learning music theory and ear training from Professor Mary Badarak was invaluable, however some theory was at times a bit difficult for me.&#160;But what was unique about the electronic music courses, and studying Musique Concr&#232;te, was that they were all about listening and celebrating the composers who challenged the very definition of music itself.&#160;These 1940's composers considered sound as music. That really resonated with me.</p>
<p>Klyce also was amazed by the computer software that Cope was creating then called EMI (Experiments in Musical Intelligence) which produced musical pieces in the style of various composers. &#8220;David wrote this very complicated program that analyzed other composers&#8217; music and figured out their styles and tendencies,&#8221; explains Klyce. &#8220;Cope was coding this while I was his student, so it was a very exciting time as it was right at the point where computers were just starting to come into the creative realm for music making.</p>
<p>Another major influence at UC Santa Cruz was Professor Peter Elsea, who was the director of the Electronic Music Studios on campus and who taught Klyce how to mix audio and edit analog audio tape. Editing music and sounds (before computers) was a painstaking operation that required a lot of hands-on time, patience and dexterity, as editors literally spliced tape with razor blades and then taped them back together to create the final audio pieces they wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the first assignments Peter gave us was to compose a Musique Concr&#232;te piece on 1/4 inch tape that had only one sound at a time and constrain ourselves to work in mono,&#8221; says Klyce. &#8220;I think that having a creative constraint was one of the most valuable lessons I&#8217;ve ever learned in my life. And David Cope encouraged the computer aspect of it. I really got excited about computers because of him.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Professor David Cope's profound influence</h3>
<p>&#8220;Ren Klyce is a truly gifted man of immense talent, and no one who knows him and his abilities could possibly say any differently,&#8221; said Cope.</p>
<p>Even though Klyce is now a renowned sound designer, he was never formally trained. While at UC Santa Cruz, he continued to pursue electronic music, computers, and, thanks to Peter Elsea's class and access to the studio,&#160; learned the necessary tools and techniques along the way. A turning point for Klyce was when he successfully completed a composition assignment from Cope where he composed electronic music using a computer drum machine. Cope reviewed it and liked what he heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting how at different times of your life, when you get praise from people you respect, how far that can go and David Cope did that for me,&#8221; says Klyce. &#8220;He gave me encouragement which gave me confidence. When you have your teacher tell you, without a grade, but just&#160;<em>tell</em>&#160;you&#8230;.It was a very empowering moment for me. I was so appreciative of that.&#8221;</p>
<h3>"Sound is fifty percent of the movie-going experience." &#8211; George Lucas</h3>
<p>&#8220;When I was nine&#160;years old, George Lucas had rented the house next door at&#160;8 Laurel &#8221; says Klyce. &#8220;George was editing&#160;<a href="http://lucasfilm.com/thx-1138">THX-1138</a>&#160;in this house. My godfather, [famed sound artist and radio satirist]&#160;<a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/10/03/445015413/remembering-henry-jacobs-the-goof-off-who-pioneered-surround-sound">Henry Sandy Jacobs</a>&#160;was the one who told me that George was making his movie there.&#160;(Lucas' sound designer,&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Murch">Walter Murch</a>, had hired Jacobs for voice work in the film).</p>
<p>A decade later, Klyce got what would be a very fortuitous summer job as an art assistant on an animated feature that was being produced by Lucas. While working on the film, (<em>Twice Upon a Time</em>)&#160;&#160;Klyce met another young 19 year old named&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher">David Fincher</a>, who would later grow up to be one of Hollywood&#8217;s most successful film directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were fortunate because we didn&#8217;t have to go to L.A. to get our start.&#160;Films like&#160;<em>THX-1138</em>,&#160;<em>American Graffiti</em>, and&#160;<em>Star Wars</em>&#160;were being made here in our Bay Area backyard, and we were lucky enough to have gotten the job on&#160;<em>Twice Upon a Time</em>.</p>
<p>Fincher and Klyce became fast friends and found that they really enjoyed working together. &#8220;David is a genius&#8230;just incredibly talented,&#8221; says Klyce. But despite their talent, they still needed to manage their way up in an extremely competitive industry. Their perseverance paid off. Big time.</p>
<h3>A smoking fetus</h3>
<p>As Klyce and Fincher were working on&#160;<em>Twice Upon a Time</em>,&#160;Fincher got a side job to direct his first commercial for the American Cancer Society, and asked Klyce to work with him on it.&#160;The spot aimed at warning pregnant women about the dangers of smoking.&#160;The pitch:&#160;Fincher wanted to show the image of a fetus (in utero) smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a bit grotesque,&#8221; says Klyce who did the music and sound for the commercial. &#8220;You see a baby fetus close up and think how sweet it is, and then the camera pulls back and the baby lifts up this massive cigarette to its mouth, smoking it&#8230;the music sours! It was the beginning of David pushing the controversy button on society. If you can get a lot of people to react &#8211; even if it&#8217;s negative &#8211; you can start a conversation. So we did that and it actually did really well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter Elsea was generous and allowed Klyce to use the UCSC music studio to produce his soundtrack.&#160;"I didn't own the proper tools to create the music, so I was most appreciative to Peter in letting me sneak in after hours and use the studio," says Klyce.</p>
<p>Fincher went on to direct music videos by many well-known artists, including Madonna, and most notably her controversial&#160;<em>Like a Prayer</em>&#160;video. In the early 1990s, he got his first feature film directing project,&#160;<em>Alien 3</em>, and wanted to hire Klyce to do the sound, but the producers wouldn&#8217;t go for it. &#8220;David tried to get me on it but I had no experience, and therefore couldn&#8217;t get hired."</p>
<p>But on his next film,&#160;<em>Seven</em>, Fincher would not take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer when it came time to hire Klyce to design the sound. &#8220;He told the producers he wanted me as the designer and he really championed me,&#8221; says Klyce. &#8220;And so the studio finally agreed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many times people ask me, &#8216;how do you get into the film industry?&#8217;&#8221; says Klyce. &#8220;And the only advice I can give is to make friends and collaborate with other young filmmakers who you think are exceptional,&#160;because young filmmakers grow up, and can grow up to be amazing filmmakers, and David certainly did.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Academy Award nominations</h3>
<p>Since that time, Klyce has been the sound designer on virtually all of David Fincher&#8217;s films and commercials, as well as the hit Netflix series&#160;<em>House of Cards</em>. He&#8217;s been nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Achievement in Sound Mixing and Best Achievement in Sound Editing for&#160;<em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>; Best Achievement in Sound Mixing for&#160;<em>The Social Network</em>; Best Achievement in Sound Mixing for&#160;<em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>; and Best Sound Effects Editing for&#160;<em>Fight Club</em>.</p>
<p>David Fincher said of Ren in a&#160;<em>Guardian</em>&#160;interview: &#8220;I work with Ren Klyce, who&#8217;s worked on all my movies since&#160;<em>Seven</em>, and who I trust implicitly. He&#8217;s just responsible for the sound. He helps choose the composer, helps spot the music and where it goes, and he works with all the source cues.&#8221; Fincher adds, &#8220;on&#160;<em>Panic Room</em>, for instance, which is an interesting movie &#8211; maybe not from an audience&#8217;s standpoint &#8211; but from a technical standpoint: you have an entire movie taking place in one space. To have that space evolve in some kind of way over the course of two hours, part of the thing he did was &#8230; he would record all the Foley, all the footsteps, all the doorknob turns, all the hard effects of everything, in the actual set that we were shooting in on the weekends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other films Klyce has worked on include the recent&#160;<em>Alice Through the Looking Glass&#160;</em>(directed by James Bobin), Pixar&#8217;s&#160;<em>Inside Out</em>&#160;(directed by Pete Docter), Spike Jonze&#8217;s&#160;<em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>,&#160;<em>Her</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Being John Malkovich</em>, and Fincher&#8217;s&#160;<em>Gone Girl</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Zodiac</em>.</p>
<p>Being nominated for five&#160;Oscars, Klyce laughs that he still doesn&#8217;t really understand the process of getting selected. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it happens! But it&#8217;s a really interesting thing to have happen to you&#8230;.The first time for me was for&#160;<em>Fight Club</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with Fincher, Klyce also enjoys working with director Spike Jonze. &#8220;I worked on Spike's last film,&#160;<em>Her</em>,&#160;as his music editor,&#8221; says Klyce. &#8220;That was a wonderful experience because I got to work with [Canadian indie rock band] Arcade Fire.&#160;They&#8217;re amazing people.&#160;Being with them in their studio in Montreal was a real treat.&#160;In fact, there was a moment where David Cope was going to collaborate with them.&#160;The film involves a man who falls in love with a female voiced computer named Samantha, and at one point in the film, Samantha composes a piece of music.&#160;Winn and Regine (Arcade Fire) were fans of David Cope's work with EMI, and wanted to collaborate with Cope in composing the score.&#160;How cool is that?&#160;Arcade Fire are fans of a UCSC professor! I arranged a few calls with the band and Cope, which went well, and then Cope agreed to send them a bunch of EMI's midi files to work with.&#160;Unfortunately, Spike didn't end up using any of the pieces and so Cope never got to be a part of the film."</p>
<p>Klyce is currently busy teaming up with David Fincher again on a new series for Netfilx called&#160;<em>Mindhunter</em>&#160;(which is based on the book&#160;<em>Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI&#8217;s Elite Serial Crime Unit</em>&#160;and is being produced by Fincher and Charlize Theron), and is working on a documentary as music editor for&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Reznor">Trent Reznor</a>&#160;(film score composer/Nine Inch Nails founder).&#160;"The documentary is about climate change and is a very important topic, especially this election year."</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also really excited about having recently purchased two older, French toy pianos from a now extinct manufacturer named Michelsonne. &#8220;The factory sadly burned down in 1970, and since then, they have been hard to find,&#8221; says Klyce. &#8220;The Michelsonne has an unusual sound that is very&#160;different&#160;from the standard. The tone is quite whimsical yet haunting, and has inspired me to write a piece. I plan to record it with two microphones (one close, one far) in an empty concrete corridor.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he&#8217;s not in the studio, Klyce enjoys all that the Bay Area has to offer. Together with his family, he loves to cook as well as be outside hiking and biking, and going to San Francisco. &#8220;We pretend we&#8217;re visiting from far away, and do all the tourist things that people on vacation enjoy doing in this great city. People fly from the other side of the globe to visit this place, so it's a fun way of reminding ourselves how&#160;lucky&#160;we are to live here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reflecting back on why he chose UC Santa Cruz, Ren says: &#8220;I just liked it. It was close enough to home and I thought it was beautiful, and my friends were there. My sister and brother-in-law were there, too!&#160;It was exciting to have fantastic teachers who enlightened me and gave me the tools to figure things out. The Santa Cruz period of my life is still very special to me.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="65b5152c8072701752a34ca33c59d26e"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2017/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/10/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1483470083348</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483470083348</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
