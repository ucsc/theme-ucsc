<p>Summer is the perfect time for smaller class sizes and a peaceful atmosphere. There are more than 250 courses both ranging from screenwriting, to marine ecology, to survey of rap and hip hop music, and anything UC Santa Cruz students need to graduate.There are also 20 online classes offered so students can take summer anywhere.</p>
<p>Extended again this year, UCSC staff and faculty get half off tuition to encourage professional and personal development. Students and staff can enroll up until the first day of classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Summer is a unique time when classes are open to everyone,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;Staff, community members, high school students eager to start their college education, and students from other universities can take advantage of this fabulous campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>With multiple sessions, summer allows ample time to study with top-notch faculty, while still having time to work and have fun.</p>

This was also an opportunity for us to provide information about a number of improvements, policing initiatives, and current events that affect our community.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback we received, a town hall has been organized for May 2, 2017, from 5&#8211;7 p.m. at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. The town hall will be moderated by members of the Indian Student Association, Sigma Lambda Beta, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and the SUA Office of Diversity and Inclusion. This is also being sponsored by the Title IX Office and Office of Standards and Community.</p>
<p>We hope that you will be able to join us to discuss issues or concerns you have to enhance security across campus, increase collaboration and interaction with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, and become more informed about initiatives we have implemented.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cac313318072701702deaeb0dba29baa"><name>zachos-national-academy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Climate scientist James Zachos elected to National Academy of Sciences</title><summary>Election to the academy is one of the highest honors a U.S. scientist can receive.</summary><keywords>James Zachos, National Academy of Sciences, NAS, climate change</keywords><start-date>1493708400000</start-date><display-name>Climate scientist James Zachos elected to National Academy of Sciences</display-name><path>/2017/05/zachos-national-academy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/zachos-national-academy</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1493755432390</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495648106482</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/jim-zachos-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/jim-zachos-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jim-zachos-350.jpg</name><display-name>jim-zachos-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>105539</file-size><width>350</width><height>382</height></image><image-alt>James Zachos</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jim-zachos-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19279</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>James Zachos</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>James Zachos</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>James Zachos, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of his distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.</p>
<p>Election to the academy is one of the highest honors a U.S. scientist can receive. Zachos joins 11 other UCSC faculty who are members of the academy.</p>
<p>"Jim Zachos has been transforming our understanding of ancient climates since his time as a graduate student and all through his long career at UC Santa Cruz. I'm extremely happy that the National Academy of Sciences has recognized those contributions," said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>A leader in the fields of paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, Zachos studies the climates and marine environments of Earth's distant past by analyzing evidence in the layers of sediments deposited on the seafloor. His research has reshaped scientists' views of long-term climate change and rapid climate transitions during the past 65 million years.</p>
<p>Zachos's investigations of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and other major climate shifts in Earth's past are highly relevant to understanding how human activities are driving modern-day global climate change. A study he coauthored in 2016 shows that the current rate at which carbon is being released into the atmosphere is unprecedented in at least the past 66 million years.</p>

<br/>
 Over the past several weeks, flyers urging whites to &#8220;love who they are&#8221; have appeared across campus. They are produced by an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as a white nationalist hate group. While we unequivocally support freedom of expression on campus, and student and employee pride in their identities, as an institution of higher learning we are equally committed to ensuring that our campus community has the historical context needed to understand the arguments these flyers make.<br/>
<br/>
 Campus Diversity Officers Dr. Teresa Maria Linda Scholz (Staff &amp; Students) and Professor Martin Berger (Faculty) invite you to participate in a conversation about the flyers and campus climate. The event will take place on <strong><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4344" target="_blank">Monday, May 15 from 5:30-7:30 pm in the Oakes Learning Center</a></strong>.<br/>
<br/>
 We will begin the event by hearing briefly from faculty who work on race, gender and representation about the flyers&#8217; ideological significance before turning to audience roundtable discussions. We ultimately want your perspective in determining concrete steps that our campus can take to build a more inclusive community&#8212;for those of us of color, those of us who are white, and all of us with multiple, intersecting identities.<br/>
<br/>
 We want people of color to feel safe and valued on campus and we want European Americans to feel safe and valued on campus. We hope that European Americans will understand that they have a role to play in addressing the problems of race and that students of color will appreciate that European Americans can be allies in the fight for racial justice.<br/>
<br/>
 We&#8212;a daughter of Central American immigrants and a son of European immigrants&#8212;stand united in urging our community to embrace our multiracial makeup as a strength. The conflict we face is not between different groups of people but between different systems of belief. We know that all of us can be united on the right side of that conflict, on the right side of history. Whatever your identity, please join us in rejecting any message that seeks to divide us by race.<br/>
<br/>
 Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
 Teresa Maria Linda Scholz<br/>
 Campus Diversity Officer for Students and Staff<br/>

<br/>
 Guthman is one of more than <a href="https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/fellowship-program/fellows?keys=&amp;year%5B%5D=2017&amp;items_per_page=All">50 artists and scholars</a> selected to participate in the program, which recognizes past achievement as well as exceptional promise.<br/>
<br/>
 It has been an extraordinary spring for Guthman, who received a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2017/04/guthman-guggenheim.html">Guggenheim Fellowship</a> in early April.</p>
<p>Guthman is a geographer who has been widely recognized for her study of organic farming and sustainable agriculture in California, as well as for her critical analysis of the "obesity epidemic." She is an alumna of UC Santa Cruz (B.A., sociology, 1979) who joined the faculty in 2003.</p>
<p>The author of more than 40 articles and two books, Guthman has a third manuscript, co-edited with Alison Alkon, about food activism that is coming out later this year.</p>
<p>"Julie Guthman is an expert in California agriculture and alternative food systems, and these fellowships recognize her status at the forefront of this important scholarship," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>As a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, Guthman will spend the 2017-18 academic year in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with men and women at the forefront of the arts, journalism, humanities, sciences, and social sciences.</p>
<p>Guthman will use the time to work on a book project tentatively titled "Wilted: Verticillium dahliae in the making and unmaking of California's strawberry industry." The book will examine how efforts to manage the soil pathogen gave rise to the modern strawberry industry.</p>
<p>As part of the fellowship, Guthman will deliver a public talk in October. Her topic, "Social Justice and the New Food Activism," examines how social justice concerns gave rise to approaches beyond organic and local.

Will it mean higher rent? More competition for productive land? An infusion of cash to enhance operations, or perhaps a welcome out for older farmers who are looking to retire?</p>
<p>No one knows, but Madeleine Fairbairn, an assistant professor of environmental studies, is seeking answers as she embarks on a two-year investigation of the little-studied phenomenon.</p>
<p>Investing in farmland is smart business for managers of pension funds, college endowments, and hedge funds, said Fairbairn. It generates stable income in the form of rent and capital gains as the land appreciates in value, and it diversifies portfolios&#8212;thereby reducing risk&#8212;for financial investors.</p>
<p>"We&#8217;re seeing growing interest in farmland acquisition, and we are seeing new investment vehicles being developed, but we have no idea what it means for small and mid-sized farmers," said Fairbairn, who received a $150,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to study "farmland financialization" in areas of peak agricultural production in California and Illinois.</p>
<p>Until about 2008, financial services companies looked askance at buying farmland, but today, they are snapping it up at an impressive pace: As an example, Fairbairn says TIAA, the leading retirement investor for the academic community, owned no agricultural land before about 2007; today, TIAA controls $8 billion worth of farmland globally, investing on behalf of itself as well as other institutional investors.</p>
<p>"We're in the beginning stages of what could be a significant shift in land ownership," said Fairbairn. "Pension funds have enormous resources because they manage money for so many individuals. This has potentially major implications, since access to affordable land is a cornerstone of American agriculture."</p>
<p>A rural sociologist, Fairbairn has tracked the trend since it first emerged. She has attended agricultural investment conferences where "farmland funds" were pitched to potential investors, and witnessed the development of investment vehicles that cater to the phenomenon, including publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) that first came on the U.S. market in 2013.</p>
<p>"Land ownership is a really important part of agriculture, but one that most people spend very little time thinking about," said Fairbairn, who was delighted to join the faculty at UC Santa Cruz, a campus with a legacy of pioneering scholarship in rural sociology, led by Research Professor Bill Friedland, Julie Guthman, and others.</p>
<p>California and Illinois represent two poles of U.S. agriculture: California is dominated by high-value specialty crops and "permanent crops" like almonds and wine grapes; land is very expensive; and corporations already are major players. Illinois produces commodity row crops like corn and soybeans, and is home to more small, family-owned farms.</p>
<p>Demographics, too, are playing a role in shifting patterns of land ownership: The average age of today's land-owning farmer is 58. "If investors offer a sale-leaseback option to farmers, it could be good for farmers looking at retirement," said Fairbairn.</p>
<p>"Right now, we have this trend with very little information about what it means for farmers," she said. "The number of farmers in this country declined precipitously throughout the 20th century. Will this further that decline? Will it help farmers stay on the land? We just don't know."</p>
<p>The consequences of institutional investment matter on another level, noted Fairbairn: Institutional investors such as pension funds and university endowments manage the capital of millions of employees and the donations of thousands of alumni. "It's hard enough for individuals to know what those fund managers are doing with their capital, never mind what the impacts are on the ground," she said.</p>
<p>Fairbairn's research will include in-depth interviews with farmers, community members, and landowners in Monterey county, as well as with key stakeholders who play central roles on the national level, including farm advocates and professional farmland managers. The USDA grant funds a "seed project" to establish a baseline of information about the consequences of "farmland financialization" for farmers.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased that the USDA is funding Professor Fairbairn's project. In order to support the next generation of agricultural producers, it is critical we gain a better understanding of land acquisition trends, particularly as this relates to land and capital access," said Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-Carmel Valley). &#8220;I will continue to advocate for these efforts on a federal level, and work to expand opportunities for producers and institutions like UCSC that seek to study these trends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairbairn's collaborators on the project include Kathryn De Master, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at UC Berkeley; Loka Ashwood, assistant professor of in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology at Auburn University; and Anne Randle, an agriculture and natural resource agent for the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension.</p>
<p>"We are hoping our research will help optimize the relationship between financial landlords and tenant farmers," said Fairbairn. "As a society, we may need to develop some new strategies to help farmers cope with the new pressures of financial competition for farmland."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d9ebd63a80727017179a8226a971e72d"><name>google-scam-followup</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ITS Announcement: Follow up to Google Docs email scam</title><summary>Yesterday’s Google Docs email scam involving thousands of UCSC accounts and millions of people, was dangerously convincing and pretty sophisticated.</summary><start-date>1493881200000</start-date><display-name>ITS Announcement: Follow up to Google Docs email scam</display-name><path>/2017/05/google-scam-followup</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/google-scam-followup</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1494009762025</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1494009823526</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Yesterday&#8217;s Google Docs email scam involving thousands of UCSC accounts and millions of people, was dangerously convincing and pretty sophisticated.</p>
<p>Instead of tricking someone to click on a link to give up their password or personal information, it instead tricked the person into granting permission to a third-party application who then had privileges to access their account, their contacts, password resets, and emails. What&#8217;s even scarier, once the person clicked on the link they were taken to a very real-looking (but fake) Google authentication page where permission was granted for the attacker to access the account.</p>
<p>By acting quickly, Google had the phishing attack under control in about an hour through a combination of actions. ITS also took action by purging the scam message from everyone's UCSC email inbox. Only Gmail contact information was accessed during the attack and Google's investigation shows that no other data was exposed.</p>
<p>This is an excellent reminder that no matter how legitimate an email appears, NEVER click on mystery links without first verifying the legitimacy of the message even if it appears to comes from Google Docs sharing. If something just doesn&#8217;t look right, DELETE IT.</p>
<h3>Good Security Practice Reminders</h3>
<p><strong>Change your UCSC Blue and Gold passwords</strong></p>
<p>On a regular basis, it&#8217;s a good idea to change your Blue and Gold passwords and set your security questions by going to the CruzID Manager website at <a href="https://cruzid.ucsc.edu/">cruzid.ucsc.edu</a>. Instructions are available at: <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/accounts/passwords.html">http://its.ucsc.edu/accounts/passwords.html</a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t reuse your Blue and Gold passwords for other accounts or access, especially personal accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Perform a Google Security Checkup</strong></p>
<p>This checks your Google Account settings and activity to make sure that you've approved all of the apps and other content that can access your Google account. NOTE: When you run the check, in the "Check your recent security events" section, you may see daily "Changed password" listings. This might look alarming, but it's completely normal and part of the daily automatic updates generated by the system. If any of these password changes were made in a location you do not recognize you may need to take further action. To run the security check go to: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/secureaccount">https://myaccount.google.com/secureaccount</a></p>
<p><strong>Turn on 2-Step Verification</strong></p>
<p>It wouldn't have helped prevent the phishing attack, but having 2-step verification turned on makes it harder for someone to sign in to your account should your password ever be compromised. Here are instructions for turning on 2-step verification: <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en">https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en</a></p>

<p>Felts advanced to the finals after winning the UCSC Grad Slam with his presentation on Cruz Foam, a biodegradable alternative to the polyurethane and polystyrene foam used in surfboards. Working with Marco Rolandi, associate professor of electrical engineering, and graduate student Xiaolin Zhang, Felts developed a way to use chitin, a natural polymer found in shrimp shells, to make a sustainable foam product.</p>
<p>Grad Slam is a three-minute elevator pitch competition to encourage better storytelling about complex academic topics. UC&#8217;s Grad Slam program provides real-world job preparation by encouraging students to better communicate the potential impact of their research, a critical skill for emerging scientists and scholars as they seek to engage the public &#8212; and potential employers &#8212; in their work.</p>

present a dramatic, four-screen video installation in San Francisco, hosted and co-sponsored by Minnesota Street Project (MSP), the city&#8217;s new contemporary art venue, from May 20 through June 24.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Unearthing Disaster&#160;I &amp; II,</em> the installation was created by Berlin-based artists Angela Melitopoulos and Angela Anderson. Their work examines the destruction of a pristine, mountainous forest region in northeastern Greece by a Canadian mining company.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a timely show,&#8221; noted John Weber, IAS director and the curator of <em>Unearthing Disaster. &#8220;</em>Alternately jarring and ruminative, it anticipates the tenor of ecological activism in the time of Trump and Standing Rock, as struggles over resource extraction take on a heightened sense of urgency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea for the exhibition in San Francisco emerged last fall from the IAS&#8217;s collaboration with UC Santa Cruz professors T.J. Demos (History of Art and Visual Culture) and A. Laurie Palmer (Art).</p>
<p>Demos, founder of the Center for Creative Ecologies at UCSC, and Palmer were creating <strong>EXTRACTION</strong>--a year-long series of classes, speakers, film screenings, and field trips, which will culminate with a final conference on the UC Santa Cruz campus, May 12 and 13.</p>
<p>When it became clear that the Berlin artists would play a role in the conference, IAS director Weber reached out to the Minnesota Street Project to see if a San Francisco venue could be arranged for their work. Arts patrons and investors Deborah and Andy Rappaport, the founders of the venue, quickly agreed to donate space and co-sponsor the installation.</p>
<p>Opened in 2016, Minnesota Street Project has rapidly become a new center for the city&#8217;s art scene. Profiled in January in the <em>New York Times</em> as &#8220;America&#8217;s Next Great Art Neighborhood,&#8221; it houses a number of art galleries and collaborates with non-profit and educational institutions to offer public programs and exhibitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are so pleased to be working with the Rappaports to bring this timely and meaningful installation to Minnesota Street Project and San Francisco,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz arts dean Susan Solt. &#8220;The energy around Minnesota Street is inspiring.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Unearthing Disaster I</strong> accompanies local activists on a journey through their once-familiar landscape, made unrecognizable in a matter of days by the impact of industrial resource extraction. Their journey reveals an imminent ecological disaster with thousands of trees cut, clean water disappearing from the mountain, and the sell-out of the region by local politicians. The artists show violent police and private security clashes with protestors gathering&#160;to oppose the mine. They also document encounters with workers who vehemently defend the mining project.</p>
<p><strong>Unearthing Disaster II</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>offers an overview of the stakes in this struggle. It contrasts the ecologically intertwined networks of plants, trees, streams, and earth with the massive, violent, mechanized destruction of these networks in the name of profit and capitalist &#8220;development.&#8221; The artists document a relentless onslaught on the idyllic Greek landscape, already transformed into a defoliated mountaintop desert.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The struggle shown in <em>Unearthing Disaster I &amp; II</em> is ongoing,&#8221; Weber noted. &#8220;Against this backdrop, Melitopolous and Anderson's work calls for a re-evaluation of entangled economic, social and political systems which produce ecological devastation and cultural upheaval.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Demos puts it: &#8220;<em>Unearthing Disaster</em> is a crucial touchstone of visual culture and experimental art that focuses on the priorities of environmental and climate justice in an era of emergency environmental transformation. It shows the power of the arts in confronting some of the most urgent topics of our day.&#8221;</p>

Longerbeam, associate professor of educational counseling psychology at the University of Louisville, studies the role of culture in higher education pedagogy. Her particular emphasis is on how taking into account the diverse cultural origins of students and instructors in classroom settings can improve teaching and enhance learning on campuses nationwide.</p>
<p>As schools and universities around the country have become increasingly diverse, with students from multiple backgrounds and different nationalities learning side by side in many college classrooms, scholars have begun considering how to support and enhance what is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;classroom cultural competence&#8221; of both faculty and students. Research suggests students&#8217; cultural origins can strongly affect how they learn, individually and with their peers, and may also play a significant role in determining why they came to college in the first place.</p>
<p>Are students pursuing a college education for the betterment of their families, to &#8220;represent&#8221; their communities, because their parents and grandparents got higher degrees, or to fulfill individual professional goals? Do they learn through abstract theories or worldly examples? Do they learn better alone or in groups? Which course formats&#8212;lecture, seminar, flipped, mixed, online, small group&#8212;feel most accessible to students from a particular cultural or national background, and which may require support or additional preparation? At the same time, instructors in college classrooms bring a range of assumptions to their teaching practice, many of which are based on their own cultural and educational backgrounds. Becoming more aware of these assumptions through a practice Longerbeam calls &#8220;cultural introspection&#8221; can contribute powerfully to the ability to communicate effectively with a classroom full of students who may not share the instructor&#8217;s background or cultural assumptions.</p>
<p>Longerbeam&#8217;s model is an affirmative one, as evidenced by the title of her most recent book, co-authored with Alicia Fedelina Ch&#225;vez, <em>Teaching Across Cultural Strengths</em> (Stylus, 2016). Longerbeam and Ch&#225;vez encourage teachers to reflect deeply on the cultural and educational norms they grew up with, and to balance &#8220;integrated&#8221; and &#8220;individuated&#8221; models of learning in their classroom. In practice, this means paying more attention than previous generations of professors may have done to <em>how</em> learning happens in the lab, seminar room, or lecture hall, in addition to <em>what</em> is taught in those varied settings. Faculty who engage in this kind of cultural introspection and pedagogical inquiry, while being sensitive to their students&#8217; multifarious cultural backgrounds, will likely be the most successful in encouraging learning in culturally diverse groups of students.</p>
<p>While on campus, Longerbeam will be engaging in discussions and workshops with the many groups already working on classroom climate issues at UC Santa Cruz, including the Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) Working Group and a group of students, faculty, and staff members calling themselves the Classroom Cultural Competence Collective, which began meeting last fall. In addition, Longerbeam will meet with Jody Greene, founding director of the CITL, and sociology doctoral candidate Christie Mccullen, one of the CITL&#8217;s graduate student researchers, to assist with the development of a series of classroom cultural fluency workshops for faculty and graduate students, which the CITL will begin offering in 2017&#8211;18.</p>
<p>Longerbeam will deliver the keynote address at the inaugural celebration for the CITL at 6 p.m., May 18 in the Bhojwani Dining Room at the University Center. She will address faculty, students, staff, alumni, and educators from the community on the topic, &#8220;Teaching Across Cultural Strengths,&#8221; while giving participants an opportunity to engage in cultural introspection and to reflect on their own teaching and learning practices.</p>

Giacomo Bernardi, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, studies reef fish that buck this trend and keep their broods on the reef, protecting the young until they are big enough to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>On a recent trip to the Philippines, Bernardi and his graduate students discovered a new species of damselfish that exhibits this unusual parental care behavior. Out of about 380 species of damselfish, only three brood-guarding species were known prior to this discovery. Bernardi's team had gone to the Philippines to study two of them, both in the genus <em>Altrichthys</em>, that live in shallow water off the small island of Busuanga. On the last day of the trip, the researchers went snorkeling in a remote area on the other side of the island from their study site.</p>
<p>"Immediately, as soon as we went in the water, we saw that this was a different species," Bernardi said. "It's very unusual to see a coral reef fish guarding its babies, so it's really cool when you see it."</p>
<p>Genetic tests on the specimens they collected confirmed that it is a new species, which the researchers named <em>Altrichthys alelia</em> (Alelia's damselfish, derived from the names of Bernardi's children, Alessio and Amalia, who helped with his field research). A paper on the new species was <a href="http://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=12061">published May 18 in the journal <em>ZooKeys</em></a>.</p>
<p>Parental care dramatically improves the chances of survival for the offspring. According to Bernardi, less than one percent of larvae that disperse into the ocean survive to settle back on a reef, whereas survival rates can be as high as 35 percent for the offspring of the <em>Altrichthys</em> species. Yet the parental care strategy remains rare among reef fish.</p>
<p>"It's a huge fitness advantage, so why don't they all do that? There must also be a huge disadvantage," Bernardi said.</p>
<p>One big disadvantage is that the young are unable to colonize new sites far from the home reef of their parents. As a result, brood-guarding species (the technical term is "apelagic" species, because they don't have a pelagic, ocean-going phase) tend to occur in highly restricted areas, which leaves them more vulnerable to extinction.</p>
<p>"I suspect that species evolve this strategy regularly, and they are successful until there is some change to the local habitat, and then the whole population gets wiped out," Bernardi said. "These are very fragile species. The Banggai cardinalfish is one that was discovered just a few years ago in a small area in Indonesia, and it's already on the endangered species list."</p>
<p>Bernardi's graduate students, Gary Longo and Angela Quiros, are coauthors of the paper.

<p>The endowed chair will help to fund research and teaching in feminist studies, as well as provide support for graduate fellowships.</p>
<p>Bettina Aptheker, distinguished professor of feminist studies at UC Santa Cruz, was honored as the inaugural appointee to the Presidential Chair at an investiture ceremony that took place yesterday at the Stevenson Event Center.</p>
<p>A scholar of history with a national reputation for her talents as an instructor, Aptheker taught one of the country&#8217;s largest and most influential introductory feminist studies courses for nearly three decades at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>She received her Ph.D. in History of Consciousness from UC Santa Cruz and went on to become the first ladder-rank faculty member of the Feminist Studies Department (then known as Women&#8217;s Studies) in 1987.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great honor to be named as the inaugural chair of the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies,&#8221; said Aptheker. "It's a wonderful moment for the Feminist Studies department as it continues to grow faculty, and its graduate program. The field has expanded intellectually in new and innovative directions--influencing knowledge in everything from art to physics, from literature to anthropology, to critical race and ethnic studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feminist Studies constantly interrogates and transforms itself,&#8221; Aptheker added. &#8220;And it continues to inform a teaching and social justice practice that we hope empowers our students and engages deeply with the larger community. This endowment is particularly vital in allowing us to fund our graduate students, and to bring distinguished visiting scholars and activists to UCSC to enrich both our program and the campus as a whole. We are so grateful to the foundation for this singular honor.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation</strong> was founded in 2007 to provide opportunities for social change and justice. It currently focuses on improving the lives of women and girls, and equal access to education.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz and the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation have been partnering on advancing innovative and impactful scholarship for a number of years. The foundation has funded the Baskin Feminist Scholars Program and the Baskin Scholars Program in Engineering that enable community college students to transfer to UC Santa Cruz; underwritten fellowships to female doctoral students in engineering; and funded the summer Girls in Engineering program for middle-school girls since its inception.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;</strong>Bettina Aptheker and her colleagues, with the support of UC Santa Cruz, have developed a world-renowned department in Feminist Studies,&#8221; noted the foundation&#8217;s executive director, Nicole Baran. &#8220;The Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation made this endowment because the UCSC Feminist Studies Department, and its leading example, should exist in perpetuity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no economic justice without reproductive rights,&#8221; said Baran. &#8220;There is no gender justice without racial justice. There is no justice if humans suffer around you. These concepts are born out of intersectional feminism. Feminist analytical thought must exist until all of us are equal, until all of us are equally valued in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our foundation wants to make the statement that intersectional feminism is the foundation of all social change,&#8221; Baran added. &#8220;We believe this endowment is a step towards this goal.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text>Humans have a love-hate relationship with technology.<br/>
 <br/>
 We can't keep our hands off our phones, but we feel overwhelmed by our photo collections. We are embarrassed by our messy digital desktops, and many of us feel inadequate about our inability to keep up with it all.<br/>
 <br/>
 Steve Whittaker wants to help. He is working on two fronts: improving the way we interface with technology, and harnessing it to improve our well-being.<br/>
 <br/>
 In other words, more love, less hate.<br/>
 <br/>
 Whittaker wants to reduce the frustration and self-loathing people feel about their digital messes. "Every person blames themselves about their information and its organization," he said. "Everyone feels guilty and frustrated. I have never met a person who says, 'I have such a great system, let me give you a tour.'"<br/>
 <br/>
 After two decades of studying the "human-computer interface," Whittaker, a professor of psychology, has compiled his insights into a slim new volume, <em>The Science of Managing our Digital Stuff</em>, coauthored with Ofer Bergman.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Attention, inventors: pay attention to psychology</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 Any company now building a product involving technology has to pay attention to the psychology of how humans consume and construe technology&#8212;at least, they <em>should</em>, said Whittaker. Your messy photo archive? Whittaker chalks that up to a psychological principle called "prospect theory": It turns out we are psychologically inclined to exaggerate the risk of deleting files&#8212;and to underestimate the difficulty we will have retrieving material. Hence the digital equivalent of shoeboxes full of snapshots cluttering up our closets: we would rather be certain that we have every blurry, out-of-focus shot, even if we can never find the one we're after.<br/>
 <br/>
 Digital folders are another challenge. They are notoriously problematic: they hide their contents, users have to remember exactly where they put files to retrieve them, and their organization is inherently subjective. Alternative systems like tagging and keyword search work reasonably well for managing public data ("google" is a verb, after all), but they have not been well-received by people struggling to organize their private digital worlds. Again, Whittaker offers a psychological explanation: the brain process involved in navigating folders is cognitively less demanding than searching, which requires complex verbal processing. <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>"It isn't rocket science"</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 The challenge for engineers is to invent systems that "fit how people actually work and think," said Whittaker. He and Bergman call this the "user-subjective approach." <br/>
 <br/>
 "We all experience organizational problems with our personal stuff," said Whittaker. "If engineers would use these psychological explanations of our preferences as design principles, they could develop a compelling piece of technology. That's why we wrote the book."<br/>
 <br/>
 Whittaker and Bergman have themselves developed multiple user-subjective designs to help us manage our mess, including one they call "Old'nGray" that automatically finds and highlights the most recent version of a document that is under revision. "It isn't rocket science. The goal is to make it easier to find what we're looking for," said Whittaker.<br/>
 <br/>
 Silicon Valley has already integrated some of Whittaker's ideas into products, including in the "snooze" feature in Google Inbox and conversational threading in Gmail.<br/>
 <br/>
 "Santa Cruz is one of the best places to look at the psychology of technology, because we're right next to Silicon Valley," said Whittaker. "If I want to talk to Google or Facebook, I can have a meeting in 40 minutes."<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Technology for well-being</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 <em>The Science of Managing Our Digital Stuff</em> is the culmination of 20 years of research, but Whittaker is already in hot pursuit of his next goal: harnessing the power of technology to help us feel better.<br/>
 <br/>
 "I look for areas where people need support, and I try to build apps to help," he said. "Technology is embedded in our everyday lives&#8212;phones are such a part of our minute-by-minute existence&#8212;that I figure why not use the ubiquitousness of technology to do some good?" <br/>
 <br/>
 One app encourages users to reflect on positive and negative experiences to help them understand what makes them happy. "People find it difficult to get past negative experiences," said Whittaker. "We don't understand what makes us really happy. The app helps you identify what's significant and how it affects you."<br/>
 <br/>
 Another app supports well-being by having users monitor their habits (sleeping, eating, social interactions, and work) and associated feelings, then schedule more of the activities that make them feel good. <br/>
 <br/>
 "We can boost your average mood over a month," said Whittaker. "People notice the difference. They feel it. It's a bit like the Fitbit, but it's your emotions. People think they can't control their emotions, but the app shows them the connections. It's about how much you feel in control of those aspects of your life."<br/>
 <br/>
 Another app designed for college students tracks how much time they are actually studying compared to being on social media. "Human weakness is concentration, especially in the modern age," said Whittaker. "But you see, there's a way technology can help with the problem of technology."<br/>
 <br/>
 Whittaker doesn't develop apps for the commercial market, but he does share the results of his work with companies, including Google, which has funded some of research. His findings point in a direction he'd like to see take hold in Silicon Valley.<br/>
 <br/>
 "We humans seem to have almost unlimited capacity for consuming information and for communication. It's astonishing," he said. "The trick is putting it to use to enhance our well-being."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2ffe0c280727017179a8226d80dfdd6"><name>miranda-eve</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz genetics lab helps solve the mystery of 'Miranda Eve'</title><summary>Ancient DNA expert Ed Green helped identify the remains of a 19th-century baby Jane Doe found in San Francisco backyard.</summary><keywords>Richard Green, Ed Green, Miranda Eve, ancient DNA, DNA analysis</keywords><start-date>1494399600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz genetics lab helps solve the mystery of 'Miranda Eve'</display-name><path>/2017/05/miranda-eve</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/miranda-eve</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1494430505814</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1494434219024</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Kimberly Hale (UC Davis) &amp; Tim Stephens (UCSC)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/coffin-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/coffin-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coffin-400.jpg</name><display-name>coffin-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>155291</file-size><width>400</width><height>533</height></image><image-alt>construction crew unearthing coffin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/coffin-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/coffin-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coffin-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>coffin-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21904</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>construction crew unearthing coffin</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The coffin of a little girl was found buried beneath a San Francisco home during renovation work in 2016.

Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Ancient DNA expert Ed Green joined a team of scientists and volunteers to identify the remains of 19th-century baby Jane Doe found in San Francisco backyard</article-subhead><article-text><p>On May 9, 2016, a contractor discovered the casket of a child while excavating the backyard of the Karner family in the Lone Mountain neighborhood of San Francisco, setting off a search for the child's identity that garnered international attention.</p>
<p>It was determined that the lost child was a little girl, approximately 2 to 3 years of age, but who was she? What happened to her? When UC Davis anthropology professor Jelmer Eerkens heard about the little girl&#8212;dubbed Miranda Eve&#8212;he knew he had to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read they were planning to just rebury the body without any analysis,&#8221; Eerkens told the <em>New York Times</em> in June. &#8220;As an archaeologist, I thought, that&#8217;s not right. At some point, these things from the past become our collective heritage.&#8221;</p>
<p>To unravel the mystery, Eerkens worked with more than 30 specialists and volunteers, including UC Santa Cruz biomolecular engineering professor Ed Green and genealogist and <a href="http://www.gardenofinnocence.org">Garden of Innocence</a> founder Elissa Davey. Green's DNA analysis ultimately enabled the investigators to make a definite identification of the child in the casket.</p>
<p>The type of casket Miranda Eve was found in, along with the clothes she was wearing, indicated she was buried approximately 140 to 150 years ago. Researchers discovered that from 1865 until the early 20th century, the present day Lone Mountain neighborhood of San Francisco had been a cemetery owned by the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The cemetery closed to new burials in 1902, and in the early 1930s, those interred there were removed and reburied in the Greenlawn Cemetery in Colma, Calif. Somehow, the little girl's casket was missed and left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Historical maps</strong></p>
<p>Using an 1865 plan for the development of the cemetery (a map for a time after 1902 could not be located), researchers pinpointed two sections of the cemetery that most likely intersected with the location of the Karner&#8217;s home. Historical maps were then digitally layered on top of each other and cross-referenced against photographs to identify any family plots in that location.</p>
<p>Before she was reinterred, samples of hair were taken for chemical and DNA testing in the hopes of finding a match with a living relative and learning what led to her death at such a young age. In the clean-room facilities in Green's Paleogenomics lab at UC Santa Cruz, DNA was extracted from the Miranda Eve hair samples using standard ancient DNA techniques.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Eerkens and his students at UC Davis analyzed the nitrogen isotopes in the hair, which revealed that she had suffered from malnourishment for several months before her death. &#8220;This indicates she was suffering from a chronic illness that caused &#8216;wasting&#8217; or starvation, rather than something more sudden such as smallpox, which was common during this time, or an injury,&#8221; he said. &#8220;While the exact illness is still unknown, we suspect an illness caused her to eat less and less until she was unable to eat at all.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;DNA analysis</strong></p>
<p>Green's initial analysis of the nuclear DNA confirmed little Miranda Eve to be a girl of likely European ancestry, and her mitochondrial DNA was found to be a type most common on the British Isles.</p>
<p>Research on internment records narrowed the search to two highly likely candidates for Miranda Eve's true identity, and an exhaustive search of genealogical records eventually found living family descendants for both candidates. The descendants were contacted and agreed to provide DNA samples for comparison. Green then was able to find a clear match between the DNA from the hair sample and that obtained from the living family member of one of the candidates.</p>
<p>After a year-long search, the mystery was solved: Miranda Eve was born on November 28, 1873, as Edith Howard Cook, the eldest daughter of Horatio Nelson and Edith Scooffy Cook, members of two prominent San Francisco families during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Edith died just short of her third birthday in October 1876. Her three siblings, two brothers and a sister, survived her. Her older brother Milton H. Cook&#8217;s grandson, Peter Cook, resides in the San Francisco Bay Area today.</p>
<p>Peter Cook&#8217;s father passed away when he was just three years old, so he didn&#8217;t know much about his father&#8217;s family history until Eerkens contacted him about Edith. When the DNA testing came back as a match, &#8220;It hit the roof for me. I was beaming ear-to-ear with the news,&#8221; Cook said. Now the 82-year-old can share the Cook family history with his eight children, 13 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>Principle researchers on this project in addition to Professors Eerkens and Green and Ms. Davey, include Dave Frederick, genealogist and cold case investigator based in Billings, Mt., genealogist Bob Phillips of Seattle, Wa., and Alex Snyder, transportation planner and public historian in San Francisco.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f3af182680727017179a8226d4e9896b"><name>staff-appreciation-picnic</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Appreciation Picnic on May 25</title><summary>Please join Chancellor George Blumenthal and the Staff Advisory Board for the annual staff appreciation picnic from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 25 on the East Field.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Harvey Milk was the first openly gay politician to hold office in California. Dolores Huerta is a Chicana activist within the California farmworker&#8217;s movement.</p>
<p>Stephen Biko died in the fight against apartheid in South Africa. The fiery speeches of Malcolm X ignited the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that Oakes students named their residential houses after these and other leaders, who struggled for justice.</p>
<p>After all, Oakes is more than an academic college. It is a home away from home for those passionate about social justice issues. If you&#8217;re looking for proof, ask UC Santa Cruz alumna Carmen Perez, a longtime community organizer, activist, and a national co-chair of the Women&#8217;s March on Washington, who calls Oakes a formative influence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did my growing up at UC Santa Cruz, and though I belonged to (Rachel Carson College), I was always chilling at Oakes!&#8221; she told the audience during her keynote remarks at Alumni Weekend in 2017. &#8220;Are there any Oakes folks in the crowd tonight?&#8221; The Oakes contingent let out a rousing response to the call.</p>
<p><strong>Off the beaten path</strong></p>
<p>Oakes has its own unique identity, which might have something to do with its physical location. Tucked away in the lower southwest corner of campus, Oakes College may be the most remote residential college on the heavily wooded, 2,000-acre campus. If you don&#8217;t have a specific reason to visit, you are unlikely to wind up there.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth the walk. Once you get there, you&#8217;ll see distinctive architecture&#8212;flat-roofed structures covered in untreated, fireproof wooden shingles, wedged between gnarled oak trees. Planters full of succulents line the buildings. On sunny days, you will see students on the lower lawn, taking in stunning views of the Monterey Bay. The college is now home to 1,700 students.</p>
<p>This enclave, formerly known as College Seven, dates back to 1968, when a group of students from the Santa Cruz Black Liberation Front demanded the university administration dedicate the college to ethnic studies, with services for African American and other underrepresented students.</p>
<p>In 1972, the college was rededicated in honor of Roscoe and Margaret Oakes, who made a fortune from oil profits in Oklahoma. Having no children or other family, they left their entire estate to the San Francisco Community Foundation, an organization that pools funding to support philanthropic causes. The community foundation trustees gave a naming gift of $1.2 million to the college&#8212;the largest-ever contribution to UC Santa Cruz at that time.</p>
<p>College Seven&#8217;s provost, Dr. J. Herman Blake, impressed the foundation, and inspired generations of students, with his academic research and his vision for the college. Blake, a professor of sociology, devoted his career to advancing students from underrepresented background in higher education.</p>
<p>Blake&#8217;s views shaped Oakes College into a community dedicated to social justice and science studies. The emphasis on social justice would help create a cohort of active students. Oakes&#8217;s strong emphasis on science is part of that mission; the college promotes access among students underrepresented in the sciences and encourages them to pursue careers in the fields of engineering and technology.</p>
<p><strong>Working for educational equity</strong></p>
<p>Oakes Provost Regina Langhout continues to honor Blake&#8217;s legacy, overseeing programs that support Oakes students, especially those who are traditionally underrepresented at four-year universities. &#8220;My role as a provost is to do everything I can to work toward educational equity,&#8221; Langhout explains.</p>
<p>Langhout has launched programs to welcome newly admitted students as they acclimate to college life. Oakes has an ambassador program that connects Oakes alumni with incoming Oakes freshmen who grew up in the same hometowns. New students join a network of students from their region who can help with practical issues like traveling to campus, preparing for college, and adjusting to a new city.</p>
<p>Oakes also has a scientist in residence program, in keeping with the college&#8217;s commitment to access in STEM. Every year, a Ph.D. student in a STEM field lives in the Biko residential house and designs science-themed activities for students, including open labs, mentoring programs, and faculty and student dinners at the Oakes provost house, creating an environment in which undergraduates can be exposed to the many different science opportunities UC Santa Cruz has to offer.</p>
<p>Not every student event is quite so serious. This spring, for example, the college hosted the Oakes Drag Ball, a dance that brings queer, trans, and cisgender people together to celebrate fashion and music. The college also has a light-hearted and easy-to-remember call and response: &#8220;Oooooakes!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Decoding the world</strong></p>
<p>Like all colleges at UC Santa Cruz, Oakes has a core course that reflects its unique focus and identity. The reading list has a strong emphasis on diversity and social justice.</p>
<p>Students read authors including James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, Paolo Freire, and texts like Michelle Alexander&#8217;s The New Jim Crow. The course takes a critical look at common narratives of identity, which affect how people view themselves. In the Oakes core course students learn about other narratives that are more accurate, or based in lived experiences. By comparing dominant views of identity to the alternative views, students practice examining the world around them and their place within it. The goal is to encourages students to critically engage with their surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Literacy is more than being able to read,&#8221; Langhout said. &#8220;Literacy is being able to decode and deconstruct our world in order to improve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from engaging with literature to reconsider their places in the world, students learn how to achieve real change.</p>
<p>Oakes College provides a crash course in activism for students such as Sofia Johnston (Oakes &#8216;17, sociology), planning committee co-leader of this year&#8217;s Practical Activism conference. &#8220;It&#8217;s about creating dialogue and from there making change,&#8221; said Johnston.</p>
<p>The current political climate has added urgency to Oakes&#8217;s mission. After the 2016 presidential election, currents of uncertainty and fear ran throughout campus. In response, Oakes leadership and staff took a strong and unequivocal stance, pledging to do everything in their power to protect students and their right to education, Johnston said. The college also hosted open mic nights, called &#8220;solidarity tongues,&#8221; where members of Oakes would unite, speak, and support their peers.</p>
<p>Oakes makes a lasting impression on students. Johnston has decided to attend graduate school for counseling in order to become a student advisor at a university.</p>
<p>Aside from creating opportunities for student activists and leaders, and encouraging a sense of belonging, Oakes invites students to explore topics of race, class, and gender in an academic setting. This is an eye-opening and refreshing for students who did not have a chance to study these subjects in high school, said Louis Odiase (Oakes &#8216;19, business and economics).</p>
<p>By delving into these areas in a rigorous and respectful way, students develop close bonds with one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel in place here,&#8221; Odiase said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a second home.&#8221;</p>

Davis Fellowship from the National Humanities Center (NHC).</p>
<p>Jannarone is one of 34 Fellows appointed this year by the NHC for the 2017-18 academic year. Chosen from more than 600 applicants, she will spend the year in the company of national and international scholars from 14 states, Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Each Fellow will work on an individual research project, as well as have the opportunity to share ideas in seminars, lectures, and conferences at the Center, located in North Carolina. &#160;</p>
<p>Jannarone will use the fellowship to work on her book,&#160;<em>Mass Performance</em>.</p>
<p>"<em>Mass Performance</em> argues that mass performances--in which a thousand or more people are directed to perform the same movements at the same time--provide us with new insights into the literal &#8216;body politic&#8217; and its evolving modern incarnations,&#8221; said Jannarone."</p>
<p>"When a multitude of people perform the same movements at the same time--such as 2008 Pho drummers in Olympics opening ceremonies, or thousands of young gymnasts in 1932 Prague--a particular kind of aesthetic and political bonding occurs between the individual and the mass. <em>Mass Performance</em> analyzes such events--including rallies, festivals, and athletic displays--providing a view of the literal &#8216;body politic&#8217; from the rise of European mass politics to the mediatized 21st century."</p>
<p>"This will be the first study of how modern politics and mass culture harness the visceral energies of crowds through synchronization," she added.</p>
<p>The National Humanities Center is a privately incorporated institute for advanced study in the humanities. Since 1978, the Center has awarded fellowships to more than 1,300 scholars whose work has resulted in the publication of more than 1,500 books in all fields of humanistic study. The Center also sponsors programs to strengthen the teaching of the humanities in secondary and higher education and to promote public understanding of, and advocacy for, the humanities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to welcome this group of scholars as our 40th class of Fellows,&#8221; said Robert D. Newman, president and director of the Center. &#8220;This year&#8217;s pool of applicants was the largest in memory and included a remarkably wide range of excellent scholars and fascinating projects. The success of these applicants in an especially competitive year is a testament to the quality of work they are doing, and we are delighted to provide them support in the coming year.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/02/peer-gynt.html</url><title>UCSC presents interactive, multi-venue production of Ibsen's epic masterpiece</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fdbf2a5780727017179a8226a00eb3c7"><name>flyer-literacy-postponed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>“Flyer Literacy” event postponed until fall</title><summary>We are sending this message to inform you that the “Flyer Literacy” event, scheduled for Monday, May 15, is postponed until the fall quarter.</summary><start-date>1494572400000</start-date><display-name>“Flyer Literacy” event postponed until fall</display-name><path>/2017/05/flyer-literacy-postponed</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/flyer-literacy-postponed</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1494610813984</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1494610907447</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear UCSC Campus Community,<br/>
<br/>
 We are sending this message to inform you that the &#8220;Flyer Literacy&#8221; event, scheduled for Monday, May 15, is postponed until the fall quarter.</p>
<p>This event was organized to give the campus community an opportunity to discuss the impact of recent flyers posted across campus. Subsequently, we received multiple communications indicating a greater than anticipated interest in attending the event. Furthermore, we received multiple messages posted on social media that were disturbing.</p>
<p>Given the importance we place on providing a space where experiences and perspectives are voiced freely, we are postponing the event to give the campus sufficient time to plan and secure a venue that will accommodate a large and diverse audience. For updates on our events, please see <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">diversity.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>For students who need to talk about campus climate issues related to the flyers, we will host office hours, which will be announced soon through the colleges.</p>
<p>Please know that we remain invested in hearing your concerns to inform a stronger UC Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>All our best,<br/>

This spirit of giving dates back to 1965, the year the fledgling UC campus opened to students on the former Cowell Ranch property.</p>
<p>Now that support continues with a spring campaign that is aimed to increase United Way giving throughout the UC Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>Every dollar will go to an organization that partners with nonprofit organizations geared toward youth success, family financial stability, and health.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donors (to United Way) have a lot of confidence that their money is going to good, strong, viable organizations,&#8221; said Laura Marcus, executive director of Dientes, a Santa Cruz County nonprofit that provides low-cost dental cleaning and other services to low-income communities.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because United Way does vetting for donors, looking closely at the services and outcomes of its partner organizations to make sure that donations have the greatest positive impact, Marcus said.</p>
<p>One popular method of giving to United Way is <a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=56">payroll deduction</a>. Rather than hauling out their checkbooks every year, donors can choose an amount to donate per pay period, and earmark their contributions to the general fund and/or various initiatives and partner organizations. Every year, the deduction rolls over so there is no need to write yourself a reminder on a Post-It note stuck to the side of your computer.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/donate">online donation form</a> set up for the local United Way, donors can also choose to donate in honor of a favorite cause or in memory of a loved one.</p>
<p>They could choose to support such causes as Community Investment Fund, programs such as Jovenes SANOS, Smart Solutions to Homelessness, Youth Violence Prevention, and initiatives such as health and financial stability.</p>
<p><strong>Taking on complex problems</strong></p>
<p>While the process of giving is remarkably easy, the money is used to address complex problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UC Santa Cruz donor is a sophisticated donor,&#8221; said Mary Lou Goeke, executive director of United Way of Santa Cruz County. &#8220;They understand that the root causes of problems are complex. There are no silver bullets to (stop) homelessness and give low-income people access to education and opportunities to excel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you invest in United Way, you are really getting to the root causes,&#8221; Goeke continued. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t just providing a temporary Band-Aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>United Way supports 22 partner programs. As part of its mission to increase the financial stability of families, the organization funds clinics where working people can get earned-income tax credits. United Way also partners with organizations that work with young people, from the YMCA to Watsonville&#8217;s award-winning Digital NEST founded by UC Santa Cruz alumnus Jacob Martinez, which provides youth and young adults ages 12-24 with free access to computers, software, Wi-Fi, and a full range of state-of-the-art digital tools and classes.</p>
<p>United Way also supports Big Brothers Big Sisters of Santa Cruz County. As part of its health initiative, it funds the Diabetes Health Center in Watsonville, as well as groups that promote healthy lifestyles, active transportation, and the reduction of carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing leadership</strong></p>
<p>But UC Santa Cruz does more than just send checks to United Way. The university also strengthens the organization with its leadership and expertise. Campus leaders have a long tradition of serving on the local United Way&#8217;s governance board. This tradition continues with UC Santa Cruz Vice Chancellor of University Relations Keith Brant, who is on the United Way&#8217;s board of trustees.</p>
<p>"I am honored to be involved with the board, and so impressed by the scope and breadth of the United Way," Brant said.</p>
<p>Over the years, "UC Santa Cruz and United Way have had a shared appreciation, and a shared mission,&#8221; Goeke noted.</p>
<p><strong>A healthy path for youth</strong></p>
<p>The organization has a major initiative to prevent youth violence by promoting positive outcomes, involving schools, law enforcement, recreation, and safe transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing that a lot of kids in South County are not participating in positive activities because they need safe transportation through gang territories,&#8221; Goeke said. To address this issue, the United Way is working to fund buses that can give those youths a safe passage to and from activity centers.</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, United Way is consulting with faculty experts such as sociology professor Craig Reinarman and psychology professor Craig Haney.</p>
<p>Financial giving, in other words, is only part of the total picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all comes from a shared sense of responsibility, and a need to give back,&#8221; Goeke said.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<hr style="width: 1000px;" width="1000"/>
<p><em>The following inspiring stories from United Way donors and partner organizations speak to the importance of that shared mission:</em></p>
<h2>Why I give to United Way</h2>
<p><em>Staff member and alumna Fiona Weigant: "This community has done a lot for me. I want to give back."</em></p>
<p>Fiona Weigant, education department manager at UC Santa Cruz, is more than just a proud and longtime United Way contributor. She is also the United Way employee campaign manager for the UC Santa Cruz/United Way campaign.</p>
<p>For Weigant, it&#8217;s personal. &#8220;I am an immigrant,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I identify with the Santa Cruz community, and I want to give back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weigant hails from Dublin, Ireland. She had been living in Paris in the years before she moved to Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>After arriving in the Santa Cruz area, she attended Cabrillo College, then transferred to UC Santa Cruz, where she earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in history in 2001.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I feel lucky enough to have a management position, a full-time job with health benefits,&#8221; said Weigant, who is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. &#8220;This community has done a lot for me. I want to give back to those who do not have. The United Way does not waste a penny. I know it will go to local organizations and local groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weigant feels that the UC Santa Cruz community has a special responsibility to give back because it is the single largest employer in the county. She said that it was &#8220;crucial&#8221; for the United Way to get strong support from UC Santa Cruz; the organization needs steady funding to support its initiatives to supply financial stability for families, provide opportunities for youth, and fund health services.</p>
<p>Like many of her fellow staffers and faculty, Weigant opts for payroll deduction. &#8220;It is wonderful because once it's set up, it rolls over automatically. And it can be as small as five 5 or ten 10 dollars a month.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The impact of giving to the United Way</h2>
<p><em>Vulnerable populations can get high-quality dental care from United Way beneficiary Dientes Community Dental Care, where one dollar is enough to cover the cost of a fluoride treatment for a child</em></p>
<p>At Dientes Community Dental Care, executive director Laura Marcus sees the immediate impact of United Way giving every day.</p>
<p>Donors, including UC Santa Cruz community members, make an immediate difference in the lives of the nonprofit organization&#8217;s clients.&#160; &#8220;It is no joke to say that every dollar counts,&#8221; Marcus said.</p>
<p>Each dollar has an oversized impact. Dientes offers affordable, high-quality dental care throughout Santa Cruz County. The organization accepts Medi-Cal, and has sliding-scale fees for the uninsured.</p>
<p>Dientes offers dental exams, x-rays, cleanings, fluoride treatments, fillings, crowns, and other services at its 15-chair main clinic in Santa Cruz, a smaller clinic in Watsonville, and a third outreach clinic at the Homeless Services Center in Santa Cruz. A fourth clinic is set to open in June in Santa Cruz&#8217;s Beach Flats community.</p>
<p>The organization serves people of all ages, but it has an especially strong focus on children from low-income families, in underserved populations in the county.</p>
<p>One dollar is enough to cover the cost of a fluoride treatment for a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;This simple procedure can make the difference between a child having no cavities or a mouthful of decaying teeth by the time they're 5,&#8221; Marcus said. &#8220;Children miss school when they are in pain from dental issues. Tooth decay (among children) is a silent epidemic in our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donations also help Dientes visit schools and hand out hundreds of oral-care bags complete with brushes, toothpaste, and floss.</p>
<p>United Way provides Dientes with about $15,000 in funding each year. Donors ensure that Dientes can continue to offer high-quality care for vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t necessarily have to give thousands of dollars and pay for dental chairs to make a big difference,&#8221; Marcus said. &#8220;Every donation makes an impact.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Why we give to United Way</h2>
<p><em>Faculty members show their support for the greater community through steady, long-term philanthropy</em></p>
<p>Kevin Karplus, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been giving steadily to the United Way for three decades now. &#8220;I make a decent living,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel that it is important for those who are privileged to give back to the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karplus donates through <a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=56">payroll deduction</a>. &#8220;This method is far more convenient than writing a check every year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Some of the money goes to United Way&#8217;s general fund, but the bulk of Karplus&#8217;s contributions supports Planned Parenthood and Second Harvest Food Bank.</p>
<p>Second Harvest is the first food bank in the state, and one of the oldest in the United States. Karplus praised the organization for its admirable efficiency as well as its ambitious scope. The food bank, by partnering with 200 agencies and programs, helps distribute millions of pounds of food every year to working poor families, children, and seniors.</p>
<p>Karplus is in good company when it comes to faculty giving to United Way. Professors across the disciplines contribute steadily to the organization, including linguistics professor Sandra Chung, an internationally renowned scholar and a recipient of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Faculty Research Award.</p>
<p>Chung, like Karplus, contributes through automatic payroll deduction. &#8220;This makes it very easy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Giving is one small way of connecting to our local community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chung earmarks her donations to Second Harvest Food Bank. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great organization, and it serves many different constituencies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Having healthy food to eat is a necessity, and the food bank addresses that need.&#8221;</p>

For that reason, I support the aims of our students who for the past few years have been increasingly calling for fossil-fuel divestment by UC Regents. Fossil fuels cannot remain a prominent part of our collective future.</p>
<p>This call for divestment extends beyond our students. The sustainability movement at UC Santa Cruz is an impressive collaboration that includes staff and faculty as well. It has long been that way. Dozens of faculty members signed the UC Faculty Open Letter to the Regents about fossil-fuel divestment back in 2015, calling on Regents to freeze new investments in fossil fuel companies with the largest carbon reserves, to quickly develop a divestment plan, and to instead invest in climate solutions.</p>
<p>The campus community's resolve has only increased since then.</p>
<p>Yes, UC has made great strides toward tackling climate change, but I believe we should strive to do more. I would support a thorough and transparent discussion among my fellow chancellors on this topic as well as engagement and investment in broader climate solutions. It is a moral, political, economic, and scientific imperative that we move away from fossil-fuel dependency.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ffb0475f80727017179a82267abc246d"><name>arts-ecosex-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Environmentalism Outside the Box: An Ecosex Symposium</title><summary>"Environmentalism Outside the Box: An Ecosex Symposium" is the title of a free public event that will take place on May 18-19, hosted by the E.A.R.T.H.

Lab, a research center of the Arts Division at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Panels, music, film, and performance art will be the catalyst for exploring how environmentalism intersects with race, class, sexuality, and social justice.</p>
<p>The aim of the event is to stimulate discussion and discover new ways of working by encouraging cross-pollination between artists, philosophers, critics, sexologists, scientists, students, and activists.</p>
<p>The symposium will begin with an introduction to Ecosex by the event hosts, UC Santa Cruz art professor Elizabeth Stephens and her artistic collaborator Annie Sprinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Research has shown that films, performances, and art create empathetic connections that science often doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Stephens. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;By bridging ecology with sexology, approaching harsh realities with some humor and joy, and using aesthetic surprises, we can develop fresh, inclusive ways to reach and engage new audiences such as LGBTQIE folks, people of color, indigenous peoples, sex positive communities, punk rockers, fringe artists, and other communities that are not historically included in mainstream environmental discussions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program will include &#8220;<em>Story Telling for Earthly Survival&#8221;--</em>a film screening and discussion with UC Santa Cruz emerita professor Donna Haraway and&#160;filmmaker Fabrizio Terranova.</p>
<p>Ongoing ambient performance art pieces, as well as scheduled performances, will take place throughout the two-day event on campus at the Digital Arts Research Center (DARC building).</p>
<p>A sculptural centerpiece of the conference will be E.A.R.T.H. Lab&#8217;s &#8220;Pollination Pod&#8221;--a recycled camper made into a mobile art vehicle with an ecosensual theme, which serves as an installation, meeting-place, and performance art venue. The Pollination Pod will be parked outside the DARC building for the duration of the symposium.</p>
<p>Related off-campus events include a book launch and collaborative reading of Stephens and Sprinkle&#8217;s <em>Explorer&#8217;s Guide to Planet Orgasm,</em> hosted by Pure Pleasure, on May 20 at noon, providing an opportunity to delve into the history of orgasm research.</p>

For decades, however, details of the molecular signaling process that leads to T cell activation have remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Now, a team of scientists at UC Santa Cruz and the National Institutes of Health has obtained the first glimpse of the molecular mechanism by which recognition of an antigen (such as a viral protein) by the T cell receptor triggers the first steps leading to an immune response.</p>
<p>The new findings, published May 16 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15260"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, implicate changes in the molecular structure of the T cell receptor that propagate from the antigen recognition site on the outside of the cell to a signaling site inside the cell. The activation signal then triggers a complex "signaling cascade" within the T cell, leading to a range of possible responses by the cell.</p>
<p>"This provides the first hint of the mechanism that triggers that signaling cascade," said Nikolaos Sgourakis, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz and co-senior author of the paper. "We don't yet have a full reconstruction of the signaling system, but for the first time we can see the process, and we have a technique to study it in more detail."</p>
<p>The key technique used in this study is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which uses the same principles as medical MRI scans to study molecular structures in a test tube. Sgourakis and his colleagues analyzed a molecular complex involving a T cell receptor and an HIV protein bound to a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The ability to probe such a large molecular complex with NMR was a breakthrough in this study, he said.</p>
<p>In a viral infection, MHC molecules present pieces of viral proteins (antigens) on the surface of an infected cell, where they can be recognized by T cells and trigger an immune response. Abnormal proteins produced by cancer cells give rise to tumor antigens, which are also presented on the cell surface by MHC molecules and can be recognized by T cells.</p>
<p>T cell activation can lead to recruitment of other immune cells, proliferation and differentiation of T cells, and direct killing of infected or cancerous cells. The exact nature of the response depends on the antigen and on other signals received by the T cell.</p>
<p>"Different peptides or antigens give different outcomes. Now we can study those differences, and perhaps we will be able to predict which are the most efficient tumor peptides for triggering T cell activation," Sgourakis said. "The fundamental question of how T cell signaling works is vital for cancer immunotherapy. This is basic research, but there could be important applications down the road."</p>

At the end of June, he will step down as IMS director and return to full-time teaching and research.</p>
<p>"I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to lead the institute over the past 26 years, through an important period of growth and productivity," Griggs said.</p>
<p>Peter Raimondi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, will take the helm as director of the IMS on an interim basis starting July 1.</p>
<p>"It is hard to overstate Gary Griggs' impact in shaping IMS and making Santa Cruz a destination for educators, government agencies, and entrepreneurs focused on marine and coastal issues," said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>Established in 1976 as the Center for Coastal Marine Studies, the IMS is an interdisciplinary research unit supporting a diverse group of faculty and researchers working on marine biology, coastal ecology, fisheries and fishery management, ocean processes, marine toxicology, and marine geology. IMS researchers have earned international recognition as experts on marine mammals and seabirds, coastal ecosystems, marine protected areas, harmful algal blooms, climate change, sea level rise, and other topics.</p>
<p>The institute provides state-of-the-art facilities both on the main UCSC campus and at the Coastal Science Campus, which has grown dramatically since Long Marine Laboratory opened in 1978. Griggs was instrumental in establishing partnerships with state and federal agencies, leading to a NOAA Fisheries lab and a state marine wildlife center now located at the Coastal Science Campus and a U.S. Geological Survey lab nearby. Interactions and collaborations with scientists at these agencies benefit both research and teaching at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Griggs also oversaw the development of new facilities at Long Marine Laboratory, including the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, with its public outreach and education programs, the Ocean Health building, and a major expansion of the marine vertebrate research facilities currently under way. A new Coastal Biology building to house the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology is set to open this summer.</p>
<p>"None of this was quick or easy," Griggs said. "One thing I learned is you have to be persistent and have a vision."</p>
<p>Every important project needs a champion, he said, crediting William Doyle, his predecessor as IMS director and a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, for getting Long Marine Lab and the marine science program off the ground in the first place. "It's exciting to see what we've achieved over the years from what Bill Doyle and Ken Norris started," Griggs said.</p>
<p>Raimondi said he is excited about the opportunities created by new IMS facilities and programs. "The expansion of the marine vertebrate facility will be completed soon, and it's a major upgrade, including a complete renovation of all the pools. It will give us the capacity to do a lot of things we couldn't do before because of the larger pools," he said.</p>
<p>Raimondi also noted a growing emphasis on developing the science needed to address marine and coastal policy issues, reflected in the new graduate training program in coastal science and policy that will be based in the Ocean Health building. "The integration of coastal science and policy was envisioned years ago by Gary, and it is now coming to fruition," he said.</p>
<p>Griggs, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1968, is an expert on coastal geology, shoreline processes, geologic hazards, and the impacts of sea-level rise. A popular teacher, he has been teaching an undergraduate course in oceanography to about 200 students every year for almost 50 years. He is the author or coauthor of eight books, including <em>Living with the Changing California Coast; California&#8217;s Coast and Beaches</em>; and, most recently, <em>Our Ocean Backyard</em>, a collection of essays from a column he has been writing for the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em> for the past nine years. He has two more books in press that will come out later this year. Griggs has earned many awards and honors for his research and teaching, including a Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCSC Alumni Association and Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>Raimondi is known for long-term studies of coastal ecosystems, including ongoing surveys of the intertidal coast of North America from Baja California to Alaska, and as a pioneer in ecology-based management of fisheries. He was chair of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from 2003 to 2016, and he has served on advisory panels for a variety of state and federal agencies. Raimondi received his division's Outstanding Faculty Award in 2012 and the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in 2009. He earned his B.A. in philosophy at Northern Arizona University and his Ph.D. in biology at UC Santa Barbara, and joined the UCSC faculty in 1996.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="11ffddf380727017179a8226176546da"><name>keynote-latham-housing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Housing expansion supports student success</title><summary>By Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor Business and Administrative Services — Living on campus is an important element in the success of our students and we have a responsibility to ensure adequate on-campus housing for our current and future students. </summary><start-date>1494943200000</start-date><display-name>Housing</display-name><path>/2017/05/keynote-latham-housing</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/keynote-latham-housing</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1494950598785</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1497379983451</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sarah Latham</name><title>Vice Chancellor Business and Administrative Services</title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/latham_sarah-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/latham_sarah-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>latham_sarah-400.jpg</name><display-name>latham_sarah-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>117100</file-size><width>400</width><height>271</height></image><image-alt>Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Living on campus is an important element in the success of our students. Immersion in a campus environment helps foster student engagement and a sense of community, as many studies have shown.</p>
<p>We have a responsibility to ensure adequate on-campus housing for our current and future students. In addition to providing housing in order to support student success, our campus has an obligation to provide on-campus housing as a good community partner.</p>
<p>As I shared during a campus message earlier this academic year, we are addressing the need for more on-campus housing through a new development in the western part of campus. This housing project will bring approximately 3,000 beds to campus and will include units for upper-division undergraduates, graduate students, and students with families. The project is part of the <a href="http://ucop.edu/student-housing-initiative/">UC housing initiative</a> launched last year by President Janet Napolitano and builds upon the work of the Student Housing West study (<a href="http://mediafiles.ucsc.edu/ppc/studies/11125Housing.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>We are using a public-private partnership to construct the new units. Using this model allows us to deliver a substantially larger number of beds than was possible in the original Student Housing West study. In February, eight development teams were selected to serve on the UC bench of developers who would be able to submit proposals for housing projects at all UC campuses. In April, that list was further narrowed to three firms who will submit proposals for the UC Santa Cruz project. The firms are Balfour Beatty, Capstone, and EdR.</p>
<p>One of the development teams will be selected to construct the housing, though it will not own the new units. The units will be owned by a third-party nonprofit and funded through tax exempt bonds. Our goal is to ensure the student experience in the new units will be seamless to that of other campus housing units. The campus will retain all space assignments, student life, and residential programming.</p>
<p>Later this month, the three development teams will meet with students to learn more about student needs and programmatic preferences. They will use this information, in addition to the prior demand analyses and site studies, to develop their proposals to deliver 3,000 beds. A selection committee consisting of staff, faculty, and students will pick one of these developers for the project. The first phase of beds will be online for fall 2020, with the remainder online by fall 2022.</p>
<p>In the past few months, we have been presenting an overview of the project to various stakeholder groups. We continue to host opportunities for the community to learn more.</p>
<p>Tonight we are hosting a session for students at 4:30 pm in the University Center Terra Fresca restaurant. There will also be a general information session for interested members of the campus community at 1 p.m. on June 1 at the Stevenson Event Center.</p>
<p>We will post updates on the project and process <a href="http://ches.ucsc.edu/housing/studenthousingwest/">online</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1258eb4180727017179a82266ffbe086"><name>faber-gruber-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Sandra Faber awarded Gruber Cosmology Prize</title><summary>Faber's groundbreaking studies of galaxies helped establish many of the foundational principles of modern cosmology.</summary><keywords>Sandra Faber, Gruber Prize</keywords><start-date>1495018800000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Sandra Faber awarded Gruber Cosmology Prize</display-name><path>/2017/05/faber-gruber-prize</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/faber-gruber-prize</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1494956434934</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495054498032</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/sandra-faber-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/sandra-faber-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandra-faber-400.jpg</name><display-name>sandra-faber-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>84684</file-size><width>400</width><height>486</height></image><image-alt>Sandra Faber</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sandra-faber-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16633</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sandra Faber</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sandra Faber</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Faber's groundbreaking studies of galaxies helped establish many of the foundational principles of modern cosmology</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Gruber Foundation will award the 2017 Gruber Cosmology Prize to Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. The $500,000 prize recognizes Faber for a body of work that has helped establish many of the foundational principles underlying the modern understanding of the universe on the largest scales.</p>
<p>Faber, who received the National Medal of Science in 2013, is renowned for her contributions to the understanding of dark matter, galaxy formation, and the large-scale structure of the universe. She will receive the Gruber Prize at an award ceremony this fall.</p>
<p>The award citation praises Faber for "her groundbreaking studies of the structure, dynamics, and evolution of galaxies." That work has led to the widespread acceptance of the need to study dark matter, to an appreciation of the inextricable relationship between the presence of dark matter and the formation of galaxies, and to the recognition that black holes reside at the heart of most large galaxies. She has also made significant contributions to the innovations in telescope technology that have revolutionized modern astronomy. Through these myriad achievements, the Gruber citation adds, Faber has "aided and inspired the work of astronomers and cosmologists worldwide."</p>
<p>A partial summary of her achievements includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1976, Faber and Robert Earl Jackson discovered a relation between the orbital speeds of stars in elliptical galaxies and the galaxy's mass. Other such laws have emerged since then, but the Faber-Jackson relation was the first.</li>
<li>In 1979, Faber and John S. Gallagher published a paper that provided a comprehensive review of the evidence for the existence of dark matter. Among astronomers this paper is regarded as the turning point in the debate about whether 80 percent of the mass in the universe is "missing"&#8212;mysterious, invisible, and impervious to direct detection.</li>
<li>Faber&#8217;s discovery of large amounts of dark matter (using indirect methods of detection) in a certain exotic species of galaxy led her to conclude, in a 1983 paper with UCSC astronomer Douglas Lin, that dark matter could not be neutrinos, a subatomic particle that travels close to the speed of light ("hot," in cosmological parlance), but might be another species of subatomic particle, not yet known, that travels at a much slower rate ("cold").</li>
<li>The following year Faber was part of a four-member collaboration that presented a comprehensive theory of how cold dark matter could explain the structure and behavior of galaxies and superclusters of galaxies that we actually observe in the universe. This theory remains the paradigm underpinning all modern models of galaxy formation. Her coauthors were George Blumenthal, now UCSC's chancellor; UCSC physicist Joel Primack; and U.K. Astronomer Royal Martin Rees.</li>
<li>In 1985, Faber emerged as the leading science advocate for the construction of the 10-meter Keck telescope in Hawaii (the most powerful on the planet when it went online in 1993) and, with UCSC astronomer Harland Epps, developed the optical design. (UCSC astronomers Jerry Nelson and Terry Mast also made important contributions to the Keck telescope design.) Faber later served as the co-chair of the Keck Science Steering Committee and went on to lead construction of the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck, one of the largest and most innovative astronomical instruments in the world.</li>
<li>During that same period Faber was a member of the collaboration developing the Wide-Field Camera for the Hubble Space Telescope. (She may have been the only astronomer to play a major role on both Keck and Hubble.) After the launch of the telescope a few years later, she and postdoc Jon Holtzman diagnosed the spherical aberration that was compromising the telescope&#8217;s image quality. Faber then led the replanning of the entire suite of early observations.</li>
<li>In 1988, Faber was the principal investigator among the so-called Seven Samurai, a collaboration that discovered irregularities in the rate of the universe&#8217;s expansion that apparently depend on the distribution of matter, and therefore the distribution of gravitational effects, on the largest scales.</li>
<li>From 1985 to 2002, Faber served as the principal investigator for a collaboration that came to call themselves the "Nukers"&#8212;because they were studying the nuclei of galaxies. Among the discoveries that the Nuker collaboration made under Faber's leadership were that the center of every large galaxy harbors a massive black hole and that the mass of that central black hole closely correlates to the orbital speed of stars within the galaxy as a whole.</li>
<li>Since 2010, Faber has served as co-principal investigator, with Henry Ferguson, on the CANDELS (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Survey) collaboration, the largest project in the history of the Hubble Space Telescope. Over the course of more than 900 Earth orbits, the team collected data on the most distant, and therefore (because the light from the galaxies takes billions of years to reach us) among the youngest, galaxies. By comparing those data with the already existing voluminous data about galaxies near to us, astronomers can trace the evolution of galaxies throughout cosmic time.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a body of work, these advances and discoveries, both observational and technological, have helped define how scientists think about and investigate galaxies and superclusters of galaxies, the largest structures in the universe.</p>
<p>For Faber, though, they have also helped define how civilization can conceive of its place in the cosmos. In recent years she has become a prolific public speaker, providing a cosmic perspective on our planet and urging audiences to consider humanity's "custodial responsibility" for the Earth, which she calls "a jewel of the universe."</p>
<p>Faber joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1972 and in 1995 was made University Professor, the highest honor for faculty in the UC system.

<p>Coedited by Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, and Harold Mooney, professor of environmental biology at Stanford University, <em>Ecosystems of California</em> provides an integrated assessment of each major ecosystem type in California&#8212;its distribution, structure, function, and management.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Club's California Book Awards are among the oldest literary awards in the country. Zavaleta and Mooney will receive the medal in a ceremony on Monday, June 12.</p>
<p>A comprehensive synthesis of our knowledge about this biologically diverse state, <em>Ecosystems of California</em> covers the state from oceans to mountaintops using multiple lenses: past and present, flora and fauna, aquatic and terrestrial, natural and managed. Contributors to the book include the leading experts on each ecosystem and on topics such as climate, fire, and land use.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the book received the PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences &amp; Mathematics, as well as the Environmental Sciences award, from the Association of American Publishers.</p>
<p>The California Book Awards have honored the exceptional literary merit of California writers and publishers since 1931. Among the winners this year is UCSC alumna Elizabeth McKenzie, who won the silver medal for fiction for her novel <em>The Portable Veblen</em> (Penguin Books).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="12ceccac80727017179a82260cbd9188"><name>beginning-swim-class</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Diving in: Students in beginning swim class learn more than the backstroke</title><summary>Students who never learned to swim are gaining confidence and relieving stress in level 1 swim class—as well as opening themselves up to new possibilities such as surfing and scuba diving.</summary><keywords>Swimming, surfing, scuba diving, snorkeling, Julie Kimball</keywords><start-date>1494961200000</start-date><display-name>Diving in: Students in beginning swim class learn more than the backstroke</display-name><path>/2017/05/beginning-swim-class</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/beginning-swim-class</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1494964160343</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1573065385424</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value><value>Diversity</value><value>StoryCruz</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/322923312&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe></embed><width/><caption>Podcast: Hear the splashes and sounds of the OPERS pool as students talk about their experiences in level 1 swim class.&#160;<span>Interviews by student podcast intern Loukas Stelyn; editing and production by J.D.

(Photos by Carolyn Lagattuta)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Students who never learned to swim are gaining confidence and relieving stress in level 1 swim class—as well as opening themselves up to new possibilities such as surfing and scuba diving</article-subhead><article-text><p>Params Raman, 31, churned through the water at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Olympic-sized pool on a recent spring day, a feat that was, at once, both ordinary and extraordinary.</p>
<p>Only a month earlier, Raman, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz who is doing research in artificial intelligence, was terrified of the water. He&#8217;d grown up in the northeastern and southern parts of India where, he said, there was no access to swimming pools&#8212;only dangerous wild rivers and dark cistern-like wells.&#160;</p>
<p>But under the watchful eye of UC Santa Cruz yoga and swimming instructor Julie Kimball, Raman was stroking and kicking his way across a wide pool lane along with eight of his classmates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like learning to swim opens up your world to so many other things you can do,&#8221; said Raman, who wants to learn to surf, snorkel, and scuba dive once he&#8217;s mastered swimming. &#8220;It helps you boost your confidence and also relaxes you when you need a break from your studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what Kimball likes best about teaching non-swimmers how to swim: the Zen idea that in the beginner&#8217;s mind there are lots of possibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When people work with their own fears, they realize anything is possible,&#8221; said Kimball, who graduated from Crown College with a degree in German literature in 1978.</p>
<h3>Taking the plunge</h3>
<p>The one-hour beginning swim classes, offered through UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports, meet twice a week for 10 weeks. Some 40&#8211;50 students take the level I class each year, but a long waiting list means others are turned away. Students come from across the country and around the globe.</p>
<p>For Victoria Yun (Merrill &#8217;17, business management/economics), who grew up far away from the ocean in Inner Mongolia in China, the idea of running out of air and staying afloat in a body of water was scary. But, determined to learn to surf, she signed up for a beginning swim class and felt the stirrings of confidence as she learned to float and put her face in the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like Julie never rushes me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>According to Kimball, the first lessons focus on water safety: how to bounce and scull through the water, how to blow bubbles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about keeping your five senses open and not freezing up,&#8221; Kimball said of the first hours in the pool. &#8220;We do a lot of listening under water and looking under water. And, we always do it with partners. I find that students learn best when they learn from each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there, teaching moves into lessons on buoyancy and on using arms and legs to propel the swimmer through the water. Kimball, who has been teaching swimming at UC Santa Cruz since the 1980s when lessons were conducted in a small pool near Cowell College, is all about encouragement, collaboration, and using metaphors as teaching tools.</p>
<h3>Deep breath</h3>
<p>Clinging to the edge of the pool, a beginning class of nine students listened as Kimball told them to think of their legs as blades in a blender whirling up a nice smoothie. &#8220;You want to chop the fruit with your feet, not with your knees,&#8221; she said, sparking a round of competent kicking. Soon, the students were propelling themselves across the pool, their legs chopping the water: tha-wunk, tha-wunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust is so important because if they don&#8217;t trust me, if they don&#8217;t trust the lifeguards, then it (learning to swim) is not going to happen,&#8221; Kimball said.</p>
<p>Some of that trust includes students opening themselves up to Kimball and to the experience of being in the water, as happened for a young pre-med student named Tahrier Sub Laban. Sub Laban wanted to learn how to swim but was worried she wouldn&#8217;t be allowed in the pool with the traditional Muslim clothing she wore that covered all but her face, hands, and feet, Kimball said.</p>
<p>Kimball assured Sub Laban that she was welcome to join the class and not only modified the strokes she taught the young woman so she could swim in 10 pounds of wet clothing without swallowing water but later emailed an online site that sold swimwear for Muslim women and got a prototype suit that allowed Sub Laban to swim both the crawl and the backstroke without struggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we need to exercise courage every day,&#8221; said Kimball, who added that confidence is often a byproduct of learning to swim as is the chance to get away from the cerebral demands of college.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to remind myself to focus on my body and get out of my head,&#8221; said Henry Kerr (Kresge &#8217;18, sociology), who said learning to swim was a goal for him. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to think about your body in a different way."</p>
<p>&#8220;When your head is under the water, you are isolated from the world and what is going on outside. You can think,&#8221; said Azzam Qureshi, a 28-year-old graduate student in electrical engineering, who was driven to the beginner&#8217;s class not only because he wanted to swim in the ocean he could see from the hilltop campus but also because he wanted to surf and scuba dive.</p>
<p>Growing up in Pakistan, he said, there weren&#8217;t a lot of water sports and swimming just &#8220;never clicked.&#8221; But Kimball, he said, taught him about slowing down, about being persistent and being aware of what his body was doing. The experience also allowed him to appreciate the serenity of water.</p>
<h3>Just add water</h3>
<p>As the day&#8217;s lesson drew to a close, a wetsuited Kimball told her beginning students not to fight &#8220;but to feel the water.&#8221; She urged them to relax and showed them how to catch a breath while they kicked across a short stretch of open water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lift your chest and back body,&#8221; she called out. &#8220;Pop up like a ground squirrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kat Douglas, a theater arts major from Oakes College who said she grew up in Chicago without a lot of access to pools, followed Kimball&#8217;s instructions, propelling herself forward just as Kimball explained.</p>
<p>Learning to swim, she said later, &#8220;is a reminder that effort and willpower can get you a lot of places. Especially when the opportunity is provided.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="17f65c0f807270177c20a64715994717"><name>irena-polic-outstanding-staff-award-feature-2017</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Outstanding Staff Award: Lived experience brings need for humanities into sharp focus</title><summary>Irena Polić, this year's Outstanding Staff Award honoree, is a passionate advocate for the humanities.

</span></span> 
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I remember thinking, &#8216;This isn&#8217;t supposed to be happening,&#8221; said Poli&#263; (Cowell &#8217;01, linguistics; MA, linguistics), who is now the highly respected managing director of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute for Humanities Research. She remembers thinking, &#8220;&#8217;This is in color!&#8217; I saw all these World War II movies. They were all in black and white.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Croatian War of Independence was fought from 1991 to 1995 between Croat forces loyal to the government of Croatia and the Serb-controlled Yugoslav People's Army and local Serb forces.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Poli&#263; lived through the war, and survived with family and friends in a basement for a year, after being forced to take a leave of absence from school. The experience forced her to think about &#8220;life and my place in the world,&#8221; the sort of issues that preoccupy the world&#8217;s poets, historians, ethicists, and philosophers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In a sense, her focus has not changed at all over the years. Poli&#263;, the winner of this year&#8217;s UC Santa Cruz Outstanding Staff Award, is a staunch advocate of the humanities, which addresses the same concerns that went through her head during those fearful days in the basement: &#8220;Humanities are not a luxury," she said. "Humanities are our life. They show us who we are and where we come from.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Poli&#263;, who started working at UC Santa Cruz in 2008, and has been managing director of IHR since July of 2016, will be recognized at the Staff Appreciation Picnic from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 25, on the East Field.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Outstanding Staff Award, presented every year by the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council and the Staff Advisory Board, recognizes staff members who go "above and beyond" to help students or colleagues, improve programs and contribute to the university&#8217;s intellectual and physical environment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Humanities evangelist</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A passion for her work drives</span> <span></span><span>Poli&#263;, along with a strong sense of urgency. She believes the humanities are under threat at far too many public universities, and she wants to ensure a future in which her children can learn languages and delve into history, literature, and the arts.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Colleagues praise her attention to detail and her &#8220;boundless encouragement&#8221; for faculty, graduate students, and fellow staff members. Others who work closely with Poli&#263; praise her as &#8220;forward thinking.&#8221; Humanities professor Karen Bassi, in a letter recommending Poli&#263; for the award, described her as &#8220;exceptional in all ways. Without her help, I would not have been successful in applying for large grants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Under Poli&#263;&#8217;s strong leadership, the IHR established the Public Fellows Program, which gives doctoral students in the humanities a chance to contribute research, programming, and communications to various nonprofits and companies.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;It helps us to earn a living wage in the summer months,&#8221; said Sarah Papazoglakis, a Ph.D. candidate and instructor in the Humanities Division, in her letter praising Poli&#263;.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Along with UC Santa Cruz history professor Nathaniel Deutsch, the faculty director of the IHR, Poli&#263; also instituted a new program called Ph.D.+, a monthly program on campus that supports graduate students in the humanities, giving them opportunities to discuss future goals while connecting them with Ph.D. recipients who have chosen to work in non-academic careers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But Poli&#263;&#8217;s value to the campus goes beyond these programs, Papazoglakis continued. &#8220;She is also able to brainstorm (and) take advantage of opportunities that bring resources to UC Santa Cruz and evangelize for the humanities,&#8221; even in the face of &#8220;austere&#8221; funding environments.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It all adds up to a dream job for Poli&#263;, who was taken completely by surprise when she got a call letting her know she is this year&#8217;s honoree.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The attention is a bit overwhelming. &#8220;I&#8217;m much more comfortable behind the scenes,&#8221; she acknowledged. &#8220;But this is such an honor. When they told me, I just couldn&#8217;t believe it. I thought this was something that people get at the end of their careers, and I still have many years to go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Poli&#263; emphasized that her work for the IHR is part of a team effort. &#8220;</span><span>One thing that is really important to me is that people understand that I don&#8217;t work alone,&#8221; she said. &#160;&#8220;My main partner in all of this is Nathaniel Deutsch, without whom none of this would have been possible. &#160;Our team is incredible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">For his part, Deutsch praised Poli&#263; for elevating the profile and impact of IHR: &#8220;Largely due to Irena&#8217;s extraordinary efforts, the IHR has become one of the most dynamic and exciting units on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Enduring hardship</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It seems that</span> <span></span><span>Poli&#263; was born for this job. But her path to UC Santa Cruz was full of surprises, challenges, and sudden reversals.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The story begins during her youth in Croatia. In 1994, as the war raged &#160;on, she longed to move to America, but the only way out was to be part of a high school exchange program. She found placement in California, but her plans to move to Simi Valley fell through at the last moment when the Northridge Earthquake devastated the area that was supposed to be her new home.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Then came a lucky break, not just for Poli&#263; but for all the people who work with her. When the Simi Valley family could no longer house her, she got a call from the exchange program, letting her know that the program had found an alternative family in a different part of the state. Instead of the residing in Ventura County, as originally planned, she would be living 321 miles to the north, in a little coastal town called Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It was January&#8212;the dead of winter in Croatia. If she were home, she would still be shivering and fearful in the basement. Instead she found herself going on a tour of her new town with her host family, which showed her the gracious homes and surf breaks of West Cliff Drive. &#8220;It felt like I was living on a different planet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in California ever since.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Money was tight, and she initially went to Cabrillo College for financial reasons, but she finished her education at UC Santa Cruz with help from a Pell Grant.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Forging connections</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This intimate connection with the campus, along with her lifelong love for the humanities, informs her work. So does her strong conviction that the campus and the surrounding community must come together in the name of the humanities.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She also believes that the humanities has a &#8220;PR&#8221; problem that must be addressed. How can the campus showcase the impact and relevance of humanities programs, and bring its power and potential to the people who live around the campus?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With these goals in mind, she and Nathaniel Deutsch launched a series called &#8220;</span><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/humanities-questions-series.html"><span>Questions That Matter,&#8221;</span></a> <span>partnering with local institutions including Bookshop Santa Cruz, and the Museum of Art and History in downtown Santa Cruz to explore thought-provoking issues.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The series kicked off in the winter of 2015 with &#8220;Making the Cosmos Local&#8221; at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center. These events defied all expectations. A few worried skeptics told her that no one would come. Instead, each IHR event downtown has been jam packed. All of them have drawn hundreds of people.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Poli&#263;&#8217;s strong defense of the humanities does not equate to criticism of the sciences. &#8220;I love science. Science saved my daughter&#8217;s life,&#8221; said Poli&#263;, the mother of twins, referring to her young daughter Alexas&#8217;s successful treatment for a tumor on her liver when she was 2 years old.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t have to be either-or,&#8221; Poli&#263; said. &#8220;Humanities and the sciences are both important. Humanities should not be thought of as something to think about only if your other needs are met. That is really missing the point.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;When my children grow up, I want them to study language,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want them to think about history and delve into the world of literature. When they are listening to a news broadcast, and someone says something that makes no sense at all, I want them to know how to question it. I want to make sure they have a future in which the humanities plays a pivotal role in their lives, regardless of what they want to do or what they decide to be.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1c881978807270177c20a64778853c69"><name>sammy-showcase</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz students to show VR projects and videogames in public showcase</title><summary>The 'Sammy Showcase' on Saturday, June 3, is hosted by the Games and Playable Media program at the UCSC Silicon Valley Campus.</summary><keywords>Sammy Showcase, Games and Playable Media</keywords><start-date>1495090800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz students to show VR projects and videogames in public showcase</display-name><path>/2017/05/sammy-showcase</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/sammy-showcase</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1495127299046</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495127652536</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/sammy-showcase-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/sammy-showcase-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sammy-showcase-400.jpg</name><display-name>sammy-showcase-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>77174</file-size><width>400</width><height>235</height></image><image-alt>Sammy Showcase presentations</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/sammy-showcase-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/sammy-showcase-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sammy-showcase-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sammy-showcase-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21921</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sammy Showcase presentations</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>2016 Sammy Showcase</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The 'Sammy Showcase' on Saturday, June 3, is hosted by the Games and Playable Media master's degree program at the UCSC Silicon Valley Campus in Santa Clara</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz invites the public to experience the future of games and virtual reality at one of the country&#8217;s largest student game festivals: the annual Sammy Showcase. The event includes opportunities for the public to play videogames created by graduate and undergraduate students from both engineering and arts programs at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1678394229129110/">Sammy Showcase</a> (named for UCSC mascot Sammy the Slug) takes place on Saturday, June 3, from 1 to 7 p.m. The event is hosted by the <a href="https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu/">Games and Playable Media</a> master's degree program at the UCSC Silicon Valley Campus (located at 3175 Bowers Avenue in Santa Clara). Friends, family, and the general public are all welcome to attend, play the games, and meet the student creators. The event and parking are free of charge.</p>
<p>A panel of industry professionals and UCSC alumni will judge each game based on design, technical, and artistic achievement, and the winners will take home a special award at the Sammy Awards Show the following week.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz, now in its 11th year of offering videogame-specific education, boasts programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, across both the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> and the Arts Division. UCSC student games have won numerous awards, and both the undergraduate and graduate programs are ranked among the top in the nation by the Princeton Review.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>06-04-2017</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1cb18af7807270177c20a647ded07b72"><name>high-school-ethics-bowl</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>High school students wrestle with ethical quandaries</title><summary>With coaching from the UC Santa Cruz Ethics Bowl team, underrepresented students from regional high schools gathered to discuss thorny questions on topics ranging from white privilege to sports and gender at the second annual Invitational Ethics Bowl.</summary><keywords>Ethics Bowl</keywords><start-date>1495129500000</start-date><display-name>High school students wrestle with ethical quandaries</display-name><path>/2017/05/high-school-ethics-bowl</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/high-school-ethics-bowl</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1495130015149</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495554456346</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/197122565" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe>

But felines similar to Grumpy Cat, a breed called Munchkin cats that suffer from dwarfism, can also mean a lifetime of pain from hip and back problems.</p>
<p>Is it morally right, then, to buy a cat specifically bred to look like a cute grouch even though it might spend its life in pain?</p>
<p>That was just one of the questions facing nine high school teams brought to UC Santa Cruz on Saturday for the second annual Invitational Ethics Bowl sponsored by the campus&#8217;s Center for Public Philosophy with help from a $30,000 grant from the Division of Student Success.</p>
<p>The debaters came from Bay Area schools where more than 75 percent of students either qualify for free or reduced-price lunches and/or are English language learners. The students, dressed in styles from hoodies and jeans to a shirt and tie, swarmed the Humanities Building to discuss thorny questions from hypothetical cases that included topics like white privilege, sports and gender, and standing up to hate speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;It (the event) provides a low-stakes way for these students to get their feet wet&#8221; in the rigorous art of high school Ethics Bowl competitions, according to Kyle Robertson, assistant director of the UC Santa Cruz Center for Public Philosophy and an organizer of Saturday&#8217;s event.</p>
<p>It is also an opportunity, Robertson said, for these high schoolers to learn how to stand up and explain their beliefs&#8212;a skill that is not only important in life but is also part of civic responsibility especially in these political times.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Philosophy Jonathan Ellis, who heads the Center for Public Philosophy, called it, &#8220;a new and very special form of debate for high school students. One that&#8217;s not about knocking down opposing teams but rather engaging with other teams in the most constructive, insightful, and collaborative ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ethics Bowl competitions are held across the country but schools in the UC Santa Cruz Invitational often don&#8217;t have the resources to field and foster a team. This is where students from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Philosophy Department and the university&#8217;s own Ethics Bowl team stepped in. Five of them spent the last six weeks coaching high school students from Santa Cruz to San Jose in the art of respectful but passionate discourse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to give back what I learned,&#8221; said Juan Ruiz (Merrill &#8217;17, philosophy and critical race and ethnic studies), who is part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Ethics Bowl team. He traveled to San Jose twice a week to coach teams from Latino College Preparatory Academy and Downtown College Prep Alum Rock and also mentored students at Costanoa High School in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Ruiz was moderating discussions on questions that ranged from whether a student should confront the father of a friend who was making homophobic and sexist remarks in his own home to whether, in order to prevent police violence, officers should have less access to guns.</p>
<p>Sitting around a long table, teams from Costanoa High School and Luis Valdez Leadership Academy huddled and whispered strategies before giving voice to their positions that taking away police officers' guns would leave them vulnerable to violence and that it might be better to cut down on the number and power of guns held by the public instead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an upstairs conference room, teams from Latino College Preparatory Academy (LCPA) and Downtown College Prep Academy Alum Rock (DCP) enthusiastically made cases for and against buying a Grumpy Cat from a breeder. If owners have educated themselves about the possible problems with the cats and are prepared to medically care for them, then they should be allowed to buy the cat, said those from LCPA. Breeders shouldn&#8217;t profit from a cat&#8217;s suffering, the DCP team asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethics Bowls makes them (these students) comfortable enough to voice their opinions,&#8221; said Sarah Guirguis (Cowell &#8217;18, philosophy), who coached students from Diamond Technology Institute in Watsonville and noted how two shy members of her team became more comfortable with speaking their minds. &#8220;It gives them the confidence to speak out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was great to see these students wrestling with questions of real complexity,&#8221; said Cowell College Provost Alan Christy, who served along with faculty, students, staff, and community leaders as a judge for the event. &#8220;The enthusiasm was wonderful to see.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1d21b859807270177c20a6471ecdb356"><name>figueroa-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduating senior propelled by curiosity and a desire to give back </title><summary>Jenn Figueroa arrived at College Ten from her hometown of Northridge and proceeded to take advantage of every extracurricular program offered by College Nine and College Ten. </summary><keywords>figueroa, sociology, everett, college nine, college ten, extracurricular, baxter, praxis, internship, service</keywords><start-date>1495090800000</start-date><display-name>Figueroa-Profile</display-name><path>/2017/05/figueroa-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/figueroa-profile</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1495137366767</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495138014855</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/figueroa_469.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/figueroa_469.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figueroa_469.jpg</name><file-size>59027</file-size><width>469</width><height>289</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Jenn Figueroa</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/figueroa_thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/figueroa_thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figueroa_thumb.jpg</name><file-size>7887</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Jenn Figueroa</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>"It's important to me to be doing something about social justice, through service or activism," said Jenn Figueroa, a graduating senior who changed majors from astrophysics to sociology.

</article-subhead><article-text>The ten residential colleges are one of the most distinctive aspects of the undergraduate student experience at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
 <br/>
 Campus leaders like to describe the colleges as "landing pads that become launching pads." Students arrive as frosh, make friends, and build strong communities that support them throughout their college years, "launching" them into leadership roles and experiences that often shape their lives beyond graduation. <br/>
 <br/>
 By that standard, Jenn Figueroa is well on her way to the stratosphere.<br/>
 <br/>
 Figueroa arrived at College Ten from her hometown of Northridge in Southern California and quickly bonded with students on her hall. She took advantage of every extracurricular program the college offered, then helped build community as a residential assistant at College Nine for two years. <br/>
 <br/>
 The themes of College Nine and College Ten&#8212;international and global perspectives, and social justice and community, respectively&#8212;are implemented through PRAXIS, a college-based organization focused on community building and social justice. As a participant in the Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program, Figueroa has led weekly service-learning projects with community partners that include Habitat for Humanity, Save Our Shores, the Homeless Garden Project, Shared Adventures, and Second Harvest Food Bank.<br/>
 <br/>
 "I've taken advantage of every opportunity at College Ten," said Figueroa, a sociology major who will graduate in June. "It's important to me to be doing something about social justice, through service or activism."<br/>
 <br/>
 Figueroa was introduced to service learning and volunteerism during high school. The theme of "service" runs through her UC Santa Cruz experience: She enrolled in the Everett Program, which trains students in information technology so they can collaborate with nonprofits and social-justice organizations that need to bolster their computing infrastructure, and was inspired to add a minor in Global Enterprise Studies. <br/>
 <br/>
 Sociology is a good fit for Figueroa, who enrolled as an astrophysics major and switched to computer science before finding her "forever home" in sociology. "I really liked the Everett Program's hands-on work," said Figueroa, who learned HTML, web development, and other skills. "It was easy with my computer science background, and I like thinking through the social implications and how to use technology for good."<br/>
 <br/>
 Through PRAXIS and the Everett Program, Figueroa got to know people she never would have met through her own social network, and she has learned about numerous organizations devoted to diverse causes. This spring, Figueroa is helping develop a customer-relations management system for the Watsonville Film Festival. Run largely by volunteers, the annual festival will benefit from having computer-based systems that will endure through the inevitable turnover of volunteers. <br/>
 <br/>
 "When you see the great work others are doing, you see the potential to do it yourself. It's really empowering," she said. "Service is just part of life. It just has to be."<br/>
 <br/>
 Figueroa is an outstanding role model for other students, according to Wendy Baxter, director of academic and co-curricular programs at College Nine and College Ten, who has worked with Figueroa for four years.<br/>
 <br/>
 "Jenn has a great curiosity about life and people, and a passion to further our theme of social justice, and she does it in a way that empowers others to be leaders," said Baxter. "She really lifts people up, brings people along. And she's humble, creative, and fun to be with."<br/>
 <br/>
 College programs offer student leaders opportunities to grow and take on more responsibility over the years. Baxter notes that by the time they graduate, students like Figueroa have a portfolio of skills that makes them very marketable: working with diverse groups, problem solving, large-group decision making, working independently, meeting deadlines, event planning, publicity, and more. "They have the key skills workplaces are looking for," she said. "Jenn will be a gift to anyone that hires her."<br/>
 <br/>
 Inside the classroom, Figueroa has been inspired by instructors like Fran Guerra, who taught introductory sociology and emphasized the social implications of big data, and Steve McKay, who invites undergraduates to participate in his research on poverty, wages, and the housing shortage in Santa Cruz County. <br/>
 <br/>
 Since her sophomore year, Figueroa has worked 8-10 hours a week on the colleges' audio-visual tech crew, but she makes room for fun, too: She plays intramural softball and dabbles in spoken word poetry and break dancing. All the hard work is paying off, though: She is thrilled to be graduating without debt.<br/>
 <br/>
 Thinking back on her four years at UC Santa Cruz, Figueroa is surprised by how much she has grown as a person. "When I first visited as a high school senior, the campus seemed so big, and the application process was so confusing," she said. Now, she is ready to give back.<br/>
 <br/>
 "I'd like to get a job at a university, where I can promote social justice or service learning," she said. "I'm excited for the future."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1da5ee61807270177c20a647c876a2de"><name>zoot-suit-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Zoot Suit' still relevant four decades later </title><summary>When Zoot Suit premiered at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1978, it was more than just an instant success.

since the play's premiere in 1978 (photo by Steve DiBartolomeo</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>When <em>Zoot Suit</em> premiered</strong> at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1978, it was more than just an instant success.</p>
<p>As former <em>Los Angeles Times</em> theater critic Sylvie Drake recently observed, "it exploded on the stage with the force of a sociopolitical A-bomb."</p>
<p>Playing to standing-room-only crowds, it ran for a year before moving to New York to become the first play on Broadway written by a Chicano author. It was soon adapted into a feature film starring Edward James Olmos and Tyne Daly in 1981.</p>
<p><em>Zoot Suit</em> was written by Luis Valdez, a key figure in the Chicano Rights Movement. Based on a real incident, the play tells the story of the 1942 Sleepy Lagoon murder of a Los Angeles man and the response by the police, which led to the arrest, trial, and imprisonment of a group of Mexican-American men without evidence for being &#8220;Mexican and dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result was a wave of incidents of violence against Latinos and other minorities in LA and cities across the country, which became known as the Zoot Suit Riots.</p>
<p><strong>Four decades after its premiere</strong>, Valdez has created a new version of the play, which just opened in February on that original Los Angeles stage. And on May 26-June 4, UC Santa Cruz will become the first academic theater to produce the new script.</p>
<p>"The social factors that made <em>Zoot Suit</em> so relevant to audiences in 1978 give the play a fresh significance for audiences in 2017," said Michael Chemers, associate professor of theater arts at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><em>"Zoot Suit</em> in 1978 was a rebuke to mainstream American culture for its lingering refusal to allow Mexican-Americans to participate in the American Dream, as much as it was a celebration of a different vision of what it meant to be American--a vision as uniquely and authentically American as those represented in the plays of Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Lilian Hellman and Tony Kushner--but one that even in 1978 remained barely recognized as American at all."</p>
<p><strong>The UC Santa Cruz production</strong> of <em>Zoot Suit</em> will be directed by the son of the playwright, Kinan Valdez. The family and its theater company, El Teatro Campesino, have been associated with the campus since the early 1970&#8217;s, when Luis began teaching Chicano theater classes.&#160;</p>
<p>"The connection between El Teatro Campesino and UCSC was forged by theater arts professor Jim Bierman and several members of the company have taught at UCSC," said Chemers. "Jim also collaborated with ETC on a 1999 CD-ROM called <em>El Teatro Campesino: From the Fields to Hollywood</em>. Over the years the connection has deepened. Now Kinan has taken his dad&#8217;s place teaching Chicano Theatre classes at least once every other year."</p>
<p>"Our students regularly participate in El Teatro Campesino productions--some have gotten quite involved and become staple members of the company for periods of time," Chemers noted. "Kinan also regularly directs plays in our program, most recently <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/Luis-Valdez-visit.html"><strong><em>Mummified Deer</em></strong></a> in 2012."</p>
<p>Chemers added that the Los Angeles performances of the revised play earlier this year have already generated a tremendous response from 2017 audiences.</p>
<p>"The play was a smash, sold out for three extensions into early April,&#8221; said Chemers.&#160; &#8220;Audiences might have come expecting a nostalgic experience, to revel in the kitsch of a beloved piece of culture from their youth, but that is not exactly what the revival delivered."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly the openly racist, unapologetically divisive, and even gleefully hateful rhetoric that dominated the 2016 U.S. presidential election has spurred a new rise in prejudice, vandalism, and violence directed at ethnic minorities. This plays a cardinal role in how this play is freshly understood."</p>
<p><strong>On campus at UC Santa Cruz</strong>, <em>Zoot Suit</em> is the result of an extensive collaboration between students, staff, and faculty. Theater Arts majors and minors, as well as many other students from across the campus, have worked for weeks building and painting scenery, selecting and altering costumes, hanging lighting, creating sound and media, and coordinating rehearsals.</p>
<p>"I am proud that our Theater Arts Department is presenting this historic production at such a relevant time," noted UC Santa Cruz arts dean Susan Solt.</p>
<p>"The show features an incredible cast of students, including the groundbreaking casting of a female actor in the lead role. We have a long history of pushing boundaries, and continue to do just that with this production," she added.</p>

<p><strong><em>Zoot Suit</em></strong><em>, directed by Kinan Valdez, is presented by the UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Department and the Arts Division by special arrangement with El Teatro Campesino, San Juan Bautista.

While only 85 reports were received during the 2013-14 academic year, that number jumped to 181 in 2014-15, 233 in 2015-16, and we are on track to receive approximately 375 reports this year.</p>
<p>These numbers are both concerning and encouraging; statistically, we know the reports represent just a small percentage of the overall number of incidents that occur annually, yet we also are encouraged because they reveal that more complainants are willing to come forward. I see that as a sign we are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>This year we have seen a few cases on campus move from the confidential realm into the public eye, accompanied by intense public discourse. While I cannot offer specific details&#8212;for legal and policy reasons&#8212;I wish to affirm a series of bedrock principles I hope all of us in the campus community can embrace, no matter what our opinions on particular cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one should ever be subjected to sexual violence or sexual harassment.</li>
<li>We all must recognize the power disparities that exist on campus, such as the student-faculty and staff-supervisor relationships. That leaves some populations inherently more vulnerable, which may make them feel less empowered or safe to report offenses.</li>
<li>We have an obligation to promptly report suspected incidents of SVSH to the <a href="http://titleix.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">Title IX Office</a>, to ensure that adequate safety measures are implemented, and to support those brave individuals who have elected to come forward.</li>
<li>In addition, I want everyone to know our campus will not tolerate retaliation against those who report misconduct. We will respond to any acts of retaliation swiftly and immediately.</li>
<li>We must leave the investigation of allegations to the Title IX Office. It is inappropriate for faculty, staff, or students to conduct their own inquiries or to discuss sensitive and confidential matters, particularly while they are still pending in the Title IX Office. Open discussion of these matters complicates the work of the Title IX Office, violates the privacy of all parties involved, compromises the integrity of an investigation, and may be perceived as an intimidation tactic or a form of retaliation.</li>
<li>We must not campaign against individuals accused of Title IX violations or complainants reporting Title IX violations. While it can be difficult to refrain from reaching conclusions about a respondent or a complainant, public judgment before the investigation and adjudication processes are complete violates fundamental rights, including the right to due process.</li>
</ul>
<p>No process is perfect, particularly one designed to address complex issues like sexual harassment and sexual violence, but I remain convinced that our existing process is vastly more equitable and effective than the interventions of individuals or groups working on their own.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that our campus community as a whole is committed to creating an environment where all students, staff, and faculty feel safe and respected, where complainants can come forward with confidence that they will be heard, and that the university will respond appropriately to their reports. To create that reality, we need to work together.</p>
<p>That effort is well under way. We have had two Beyond Compliance meetings this year and have more planned for this fall.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage all who care deeply about this issue to remain engaged, to direct your energies toward improving our campus climate and culture so we can create the community to which we all aspire&#8212;one free of sexual violence and sexual harassment.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3218a05f807270177c20a647af3bec41"><name>galloway-rio</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alison Galloway to discuss "Life of the Dead" at the Rio Theatre on June 6</title><summary>Forensic anthropologist Alison Galloway will give a public lecture on June 6 about the natural history of human decomposition and her work analyzing human remains. </summary><keywords>galloway, anthropology, museum, natural history, rio, theatre, public, decomposition, forensic</keywords><start-date>1495436400000</start-date><display-name>Galloway-Rio</display-name><path>/2017/05/galloway-rio</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/galloway-rio</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1495489092299</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495489308090</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/galloway-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/galloway-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>galloway-300.jpg</name><file-size>59113</file-size><width>300</width><height>490</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Alison Galloway</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/galloway-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/galloway-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>galloway-thumb.jpg</name><file-size>7374</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Alison Galloway</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Alison Galloway will discuss her work analyzing human remains during a public talk on June 6 at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Forensic anthropologist Alison Galloway will give a public lecture on her work analyzing human remains on Tuesday, June 6, at 7 p.m., at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.<br/>
 <br/>
 Presented by the <a href="http://www.santacruzmuseum.org/public-programs/special-events/">Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History</a>, Galloway's talk is entitled "Life of the Dead: The Natural History of Human Decomposition." Admission is $10 for museum members, $15 for general admission, and $30 for "gold circle" seating.<br/>
 <br/>
 Galloway, a professor of anthropology, recently returned to research after serving six years as campus provost/executive vice chancellor. She is a board-certified forensic anthropologist who specializes in the human skeleton; she is in high demand among law enforcement agencies, coroners, and medical examiners for her expertise in analyzing human remains.<br/>
 <br/>
 Her talk will explore the natural processes that take place after death and the range of organisms that utilize dead bodies, as well as the techniques experts use to estimate circumstances surrounding a death.<br/>
 <br/>
 "If we die in a place where the body is allowed to undergo normal decomposition, then the remains play host to a suite of insects, animals and fungi, as well as the bacterial interactions from within and external to the body," Galloway said. "In other words, we may die but life continues and transitions."<br/>
 <br/>
 Galloway was born in the United Kingdom but grew up in the San Francisco Bay area after coming to California in 1960. She attended UC Berkeley and the University of Arizona, Tucson, where she completed her doctorate. After teaching for two years at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Galloway joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1990. She has served as chair of the Anthropology Department and of the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate. She has authored numerous publications and taught several courses, including an introductory course in physical anthropology and human skeletal biology.<br/>
 <br/>
 "As a science education organization, we are proud to have someone of Dr. Galloway's caliber presenting about the scientific knowledge and tools she employs in her painstaking and important work," said Heather Moffat McCoy, executive director of the museum. "She provides a unique perspective on an aspect of the natural world folks rarely consider."<br/>
 <br/>
 Doors open at 6 p.m. Tickets are available <a href="http://www.santacruzmuseum.org/public-programs/special-events/">online</a> or at the door.<br/>

Sperry Award, presented by the <a href="http://www.ser.org/">Society for Ecological Restoration</a> (SER). <br/>
 <br/>
 Holl and her colleague Rakan Zahawi, an associate researcher in the Environmental Studies Department, were recognized for the practical, cost-effective techniques they have developed and studied for restoring tropical forests. <br/>
 <br/>
 In announcing the award, which will be presented August 31 during the 7th World Conference on Ecological Restoration in Brazil, SER noted that the collaborators' techniques have "tremendous promise for restoration efforts throughout the tropics." Their work, the awards committee noted, has taken on added importance with the advent of several international policy frameworks advocating for forest restoration at broad scales.<br/>
 <br/>
 Presented every two years, the Sperry Award recognizes individuals and organizations that have made "a significant contribution to the science and/or practice of ecological restoration." The awards committee reviews nominations and selects recipients based on qualifications that include innovation, recognizing the development of new approaches, methods, or tools of restoration; useful criteria and standards; and/or ways to integrate volunteers or involve the public in restoration programs.<br/>

<p>&#8220;Financial self-care is a radical act,&#8221; Paul said.</p>
<p>Paul (Cowell, &#8217;91) reflects on her undergraduate days when she used to sneak into the crowded classroom of then-Women&#8217;s Studies professor Bettina Aptheker and hear her teach, <em>the personal is political and the political is personal</em>. (Aptheker is UC presidential co-chair of Feminist Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies in the Feminist Studies Department.)</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, every major civil rights movement has been moved forward through some money-related action,&#8221; Paul said.</p>
<p>It is an observation that shifted her activism from work as a fundraiser for nonprofit organizations to that of a top private wealth advisor with UBS, a global financial services firm.</p>
<p>After graduation, Paul moved to New York and worked as an activist for social justice issues involving AIDS, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, hate crime legislation, and the marriage equality movement. Again and again, she witnessed the negative impact of financial inequities&#8212;what happens when people don&#8217;t have money to support their basic needs and their ideals. During the AIDS crisis and later, after 9/11, people who couldn&#8217;t get married couldn&#8217;t gain access to their partners&#8217; benefits, pensions, housing leases and estates.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s devastating enough to lose a loved one, but to be hurled into financial crisis only compounds the loss,&#8221; Paul said. She began to understand how important it is to raise money for nonprofit organizations, to run people for office and take care of one&#8217;s self financially. &#8220;It was such a huge eye-opener how critical money and financial self-care can be when you put it to good purpose, how much you can change the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marriage equality was &#8220;the panacea legal moment that solved financial inequities and provided a healing moment honoring people lost to AIDS. Marriage equality is the lotus flower of that struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul, a senior vice president at UBS, sits on the board of directors for Invest in Girls, a nonprofit organization that provides financial literacy and leadership programs to high school girls and the UBS Advisory Council for All Bar None, a women&#8217;s network within the firm. Last year, the New York City YWCA named her as one its Academy of Women Leaders. In February, she ranked 100th in Forbes&#8217; Top 200 Women Wealth Advisors in America. On releasing the list, Forbes Media estimated that about 16 percent of all financial advisors are women&#8212;most of whom, like Paul, manage private wealth portfolios rather than corporate wealth investments.</p>
<p>In an industry dominated by men, Paul is proud to lead one of the few all-female, private wealth management teams. It is, she says, an act of social change in its own way and provides her with a unique perspective for social change.</p>
<p>This next wave is all about women, she said.</p>
<p>After generations of financial disenfranchisement, women aren&#8217;t often comfortable talking about money, asking for a raise, or asking for a donation to a cause. But soon, due to longevity, inheritance trends and more women entering the workforce, they will manage a majority of the country&#8217;s wealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the darkness before dawn as we get back to the unfinished business that is women&#8217;s equality,&#8221; Paul said. &#8220;At the heart of that are financial literacy and financial self-care. The fact that we have been unable to legally ensure women are paid equally for equal work speaks volumes. We all need to recognize and embrace the part we have to play to collectively make that happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of that involves investing earlier in STEM and financial education for girls before they drop out of math and science. Help them imagine futures that include making money, she says. Paul urges more mentoring of women entering the workplace, to help them champion their achievements, ask for raises and overcome obstacles that people put in their way.</p>
<p>This is the time, she says, to &#8220;step in and be truly disruptive at a moment of dramatic change in the U.S. The act of financial care allows us to be the author of our own lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at how critical financial self-care is as a form of radicalism for those historically excluded from wealth creation&#8212;all the important ways money makes its way into social change movements, who gets to participate&#8212;for me, all of that questioning originated in my academics in Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just out of college, he was doing an internship at a talent agency when one of the firm&#8217;s literary managers strode into the room and asked if anybody wanted to work as his assistant.</p>
<p>The manager represented the works of Philip K. Dick, Roald Dahl, and Elmore Leonard, and Egan (Porter &#8217;05, film) who loved all three authors, immediately volunteered.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 10 years and today Egan is not only co-executive producer for one of Amazon&#8217;s most popular television series, <em>The Man in the High Castle,</em> which is loosely based on Philip K. Dick&#8217;s novel of the same name, but is also penning an episode of a <em>Twilight Zone</em>&#8211;like anthology based on the short stories of the same author.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a huge amount of luck in being at the right place in the right time,&#8221; says Egan, speaking by phone from his writing partner&#8217;s home office in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles, a room filled with books, a whiteboard and TV, and the necessary writers&#8217; couch. But there is another part of the equation, one that&#8217;s probably even more important, says Egan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve Martin&#8217;s advice to anyone who wants to do creative work is to be so good they can&#8217;t ignore you,&#8221; Egan says. &#8220;I never really understood what that meant until I&#8217;d been in this for awhile. If you push yourself to work hard at a discipline &#8212; writing or directing or acting &#8212; eventually it has its own reward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Egan&#8217;s dream of working in Hollywood began at the age of 5 when, he says, he saw the movie <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em> and grasped the impossibility of cartoon characters inhabiting the same world as human actors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized if that was impossible, then somebody had to have <em>made</em> it,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and I became focused on who that was.&#8221;</p>
<p>The obsession led him to UC Santa Cruz, where he studied film, and to a job slinging popcorn at the Nickelodeon Theatre in downtown Santa Cruz. There, he was introduced to Philip K. Dick by a pair of Richard Linklater films, <em>Waking Life</em> and <em>A Scanner Darkly,</em> the former featuring a memorable monologue about the sci-fi writer, and the latter based on one of his 44 novels. Egan soon became obsessed with the author.</p>
<p>That obsession led to the assistant&#8217;s job and now to working with Dick&#8217;s second daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, producing television and films based on Dick&#8217;s works.</p>
<p>One of them, <em>The Man in the High Castle,</em> which is about to film its third season, has become one of the most watched of Amazon&#8217;s original content shows.</p>
<p>The addictive series tells an alternate-history tale of the U.S. under the rule of Nazi Germany and Japan after it lost WWII. The eastern half of the country, the Greater Nazi Reich, is ruled by Hitler. The other half, Japanese Pacific States, is under the control of Japan. There is resistance among the citizens, but there is also a chilling normalization of a life that includes a quashing of liberties and bone-chilling cruelty.</p>
<p>Egan, whose work as a producer often puts him in the day-to-day mix of writing, casting, and filming, says, &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard show to make because it&#8217;s so complicated. It&#8217;s kind of like we&#8217;re making four shows at the same time: a historical drama, a political thriller, a resistance show, and a sci-fi show, and it has to be all those things at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Egan, who is married to former UC Santa Cruz student Eve Sturges and has two children, a 13-year-old stepdaughter and an 18-month-old son, is finishing work on an episode for the upcoming <em>Philip K. Dick&#8217;s Electric Dreams</em> television anthology. Working with his writing partner, Travis Sentell, their episode is based on Dick&#8217;s short story, &#8220;Foster, You&#8217;re Dead.&#8221; They&#8217;re also pitching other projects around L.A.</p>
<p>The success of <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> has opened doors, gotten Egan meetings, and fulfilled at least one of his dreams, he says, but, as it is in Hollywood, there is the ever-present pressure to push harder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t rest on your laurels,&#8221; Egan says. &#8220;Every opportunity begets another opportunity, and you have to move fast. As soon as you get lazy or take your foot off the gas, people will lose interest in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s a moment when the 33-year-old Egan considers his accomplishments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 5-year-old me wouldn&#8217;t have been able to believe it,&#8221; Egan says and then stops. &#8220;Actually, the 5-year-old me would totally believe it, because he wouldn&#8217;t have known how hard it was.</p>
&#8220;But I think the 20-year-old me at UC Santa Cruz would have been impressed.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="37b9c9b8807270177c20a6477b65d389"><name>award-pocsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>People of Color Sustainability Collective wins top honors</title><summary>The Best Practice Award is the highest honor in the field of higher education sustainability in the state.

Its latest honor is a Best Practice Award in the Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Competition, which attracts entries from campuses of the University of California, California State University, community colleges, and private and independent colleges.</p>
<p>The Best Practice Award is the highest honor in the field of higher education sustainability in the state. It will be presented during the <a href="https://chesc.org/2017-conference/overall-schedule-2017/">California Higher Education Sustainability Conference</a> June 26&#8211;29 at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>The People of Color Sustainability Collective (PoCSC) was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/pocsc-feature-story.html">founded in 2014</a> to highlight the contributions of diverse members of the sustainability movement.</p>
<p>The collective&#8217;s mission is to raise awareness of the contributions of people of color to the sustainability movement; to make the movement more inclusive of underrepresented populations by reexamining the movement&#8217;s definitions and values; and to foster dialogue about environmental justice through discussions, caucuses with students of color, social media campaigns, workshops, and public events.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been incredible to interact and engage with the students who come to our events. The stories students share are the stories that are often left out of the mainstream environmental conversation,&#8221; said Adriana Renteria, the initiative&#8217;s coordinator. &#8220;The community that is fostered at our events is a reminder of the importance of creating spaces on our campus that validate and celebrate students diverse experiences and connections with culture, identity, and the environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Broadening the platform of engagement around sustainability is good for everyone, as collective members gain a voice and an outlet to share their experiences and influence campus policy, and sustainability programs become more inclusive of different cultural perspectives. The collective&#8217;s concept of &#8220;inclusive sustainability&#8221; supports student success and retention, and builds community, by empowering students of color, recognizing their contributions, and shifting typical power dynamics.</p>
<p>Best practices that could be replicated on other campuses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annual sustainability and social justice retreats;</li>
<li>Events and workshops addressing topics such as environmental racism; decolonizing the food system; and reimagining the environmentalist;</li>
<li>Academic research to gauge participation in sustainability programs, perceptions of campus priorities, and in-class learning experiences;</li>
<li>Identification of opportunities to educate staff, faculty, and administrators to support building a culture of inclusive sustainability through existing and new programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>PoCSC is part of the campus&#8217;s Ethnic Resource Centers, housed under the American Indian Resource Center, and overseen by its director, Rebecca Hernandez Rosser. Partnerships with College Nine, College Ten, and the Campus Sustainability Office, as well as support from the vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services and the campus provost/executive vice chancellor, increased the visibility of the collective&#8217;s work and broadened its impact across campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hard work of developing a truly inclusive culture of sustainability is ongoing,&#8221; Sustainability Director Elida Erickson said. &#8220;Education, dialogue, and continued collaboration with faculty, staff, student, and community organizations are key to keeping conversations about justice, equity, and inclusion at the forefront of the campus environmental movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its 16th year, the conference is jointly organized by participating schools to provide a forum for dialogue across institutions. The gathering highlights cutting-edge research, as well as case studies with proven success in curriculum development, operational programs, and community partnerships.</p>
<p>The competition, in its 13th year, is conducted in coordination with the Higher Education Energy Efficiency Partnership to highlight achievements and to showcase specific projects as models for other campuses.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3b3ff9d2807270177c20a647cb6f23c2"><name>pettigrew-harvard</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pettigrew receives Centennial Medal from Harvard University</title><summary>Tom Pettigrew, research professor of social psychology, received the Centennial Medal from Harvard University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for his work in racial relations. </summary><keywords>pettigrew, award, harvard, race, centennial, medal, alum</keywords><start-date>1495641600000</start-date><display-name>Pettigrew-Harvard</display-name><path>/2017/05/pettigrew-harvard</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/pettigrew-harvard</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1495642666104</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495643108822</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/pettigrew-harvard-150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/pettigrew-harvard-150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pettigrew-harvard-150.jpg</name><file-size>67507</file-size><width>150</width><height>209</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Tom Pettigrew</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/pettigrew-harvard-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/pettigrew-harvard-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pettigrew-harvard-thumb.jpg</name><file-size>7266</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Tom Pettigrew</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>"Thomas Pettigrew ... laid the empirical and theoretical groundwork for ideas that are now fundamental to the way we think about prejudice in the United States and around the world," said Xiao-Li Meng, dean of the Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

 <br/>
 Pettigrew earned his Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard in 1956. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Thomas Pettigrew has devoted his life to confronting some of the most divisive problems facing human society&#8212;racism, discrimination, and prejudice&#8212;and laid the empirical and theoretical groundwork for ideas that are now fundamental to the way we think about prejudice in the United States and around the world," said Xiao-Li Meng, dean of the school. "We are proud to award him the 2017 Centennial Medal."<br/>
 <br/>
 Pettigrew taught at Harvard for many years before relocating to Santa Cruz in 1979 and formally joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1980. He retired in 1994 but has continued to conduct research in social psychology. He has been at the forefront of studies of racial prejudice for more than five decades. An expert on black-white relations in the United States, he has also conducted intergroup research in Australia, Europe, and South Africa.<br/>
 <br/>
 Pettigrew is the author of more than 300 scholarly articles and book chapters, as well as nearly 100 book reviews. His many honors include lifetime achievement awards from the American Sociological Association, the Society for Psychological Study of Social Issues, the Society for Experimental Social Psychology, and the International Academy for Intercultural Research. He has twice received the prestigious Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, and he also received the University of California's 2008/09 Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award.<br/>
 <br/>
 The Centennial Medal was first awarded in June 1989 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). Each year, Harvard University through GSAS recognizes outstanding alumni whose contributions to knowledge, to their disciplines, to their colleagues, and to society have made a fundamental and lasting impact. <br/>

Langenheim Professor of Plant Ecology and Evolution at UC Santa Cruz, has been honored by the Linnean Society of London with the Darwin-Wallace Medal, one of the top international prizes in evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Thompson is known for his research on the coevolution of interacting species and how the process of coevolution shapes the organization of Earth's biodiversity. He has written several highly influential books on evolution and has helped shape the current understanding of evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>"John's work has fundamentally shaped the way people think about evolution and how it plays out in our every day lives," said Ingrid Parker, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. "It's great to see him recognized among the very elite group of scientists who have received this award."</p>
<p>The Darwin-Wallace Medal, given for major advances in evolutionary biology, was first awarded in 1908 (to Wallace himself and six others), then every 50 years until 2010, when the Linnean Society began awarding it annually. Thompson received the medal in a May 24 ceremony in London.</p>
<p>In a citation read at the award ceremony, Thompson was recognized for putting coevolution "on the map". The citation noted that through his work "over several decades on insect-plant interactions, and more recently with experimental evolution in microbes, [Thompson] has achieved more in understanding pattern and process in coevolutionary interactions among organisms than anyone else."</p>
<p>Thompson is the author of four books exploring the processes that drive evolution and shape the interconnected web of life on Earth. The most recent, <em>Relentless Evolution</em> (2013), examines the pace and dynamics of evolutionary change and the ecological drivers of ongoing adaptive change in species and populations.</p>
<p>Thompson is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Entomological Society of London, and a past president of the American Society of Naturalists. In 2008, he received the Per Brinck Oikos Award for Extraordinary Contributions to the Science of Ecology. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2000.</p>
<p>The Darwin-Wallace Medal was originally awarded in 1908 to commemorate the anniversary of the reading of a joint paper by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace at a meeting of the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858. The paper, "On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection," introduced the idea of evolution through natural selection.</p>
<p>Founded in 1788, the Linnean Society of London is named for Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778). It is the world&#8217;s oldest active organization devoted exclusively to natural history.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.linnean.org/the-society/news/2017/05/26/25th-may-2017-medal-winners-2017</url><title>Linnean Society Medal Winners</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="40a4bac6807270177c20a6472d513097"><name>prion-protein</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Prion study reveals how abnormal proteins damage nerve cells in the brain</title><summary>Research on the prion protein may explain why nerve cells degenerate in prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</summary><keywords>Glenn Millhauser, prion protein</keywords><start-date>1495695600000</start-date><display-name>Prion study reveals how abnormal proteins damage nerve cells in the brain</display-name><path>/2017/05/prion-protein</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/prion-protein</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1495733155134</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495734475161</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/dendrites-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/dendrites-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dendrites-410.jpg</name><display-name>dendrites-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>76978</file-size><width>410</width><height>270</height></image><image-alt>mouse hippocampal neurons</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/dendrites-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/dendrites-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dendrites-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>dendrites-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19829</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>mouse hippocampal neurons</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Degeneration of dendrites in mouse hippocampal neurons is seen in the beaded appearance of dendritic segments in the images on the left.

<p>The findings, which appear in the journal <a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e23473"><em>eLife</em></a>, may one day lead to better therapies and treatments for these diseases.</p>
<p>Prion diseases, including CJD in humans and "mad cow disease" in cattle, are fatal neurodegenerative brain disorders caused by a misfolded form of the normal cellular prion protein. Other, more common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal dementia have also been found to involve abnormal accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates in the brain.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, how nerve cells are damaged in prion diseases has remained a mystery until now. The new research combined cellular studies, led by Dr. David Harris at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), with structural analysis of prion proteins performed at UC Santa Cruz using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work shows that the prion protein acts like a molecular on-off switch. In the 'on' positon, one end of the protein delivers a toxic signal to nerve cells, while in the 'off' position, the other end of the protein serves as a brake to reduce the toxic signal,&#8221; said Harris, corresponding author of the paper and professor and chair of biochemistry at BUSM. &#8220;This novel mechanism, in which the two parts of the prion protein have opposing functions, had not been fully appreciated before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also showed that copper, a normal constituent of brain chemistry, promotes interaction between the two ends, biasing the prion protein toward the &#8220;off&#8221; state. Disruption of this interaction led to degenerative changes in nerve cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;These data provide the best picture yet of the prion protein's 'off' state,&#8221; said coauthor Glenn Millhauser, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Recognizing the nature of this state provides a platform for developing drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases. This is an exciting time in prion biology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a multi-disciplinary approach involving electrophysiological, cellular, and biophysical techniques, the researchers found that parts of the prion protein lacking the &#8220;brake&#8221; region produced abnormal electrical currents in cells. Antibodies that interfered with the functioning of the brake region did the same. Importantly, the antibody treatment also caused severe degeneration of nerve cell dendrites, the regions that are essential for normal communication between nerve cells. In collaboration with Millhauser and others at UC Santa Cruz, the researchers applied a sophisticated chemical technique to demonstrate that the two ends of the prion protein interact with each to alter the amount of toxic signal that is delivered.</p>
<p>As a result of their findings, the researchers caution against administering antibodies against the prion as a possible therapy for both prion and Alzheimer&#8217;s diseases. &#8220;Our study sounds a serious warning about the possible detrimental side effects of this strategy, since we have shown that such antibodies cause dramatic degeneration of nerve cells by interfering with the normal on-off function of the prion protein,&#8221; Harris said.</p>
<p>The researchers hope their study will lead to better therapies for neurodegenerative disorders, as well as help clinicians avoid the possible dangerous side-effects of using anti-prion protein antibodies for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p>Funding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the German Research Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="40d89c69807270177c20a647044aefc5"><name>changes-myucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Changes coming to MyUCSC - July 8</title><summary>Major improvements to MyUCSC and Campus Solutions will be implemented over the July 8th weekend.</summary><start-date>1495609200000</start-date><display-name>Changes coming to MyUCSC - July 8</display-name><path>/2017/05/changes-myucsc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/changes-myucsc</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1495736555261</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1495736984653</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/changes-myucsc.png</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/changes-myucsc.png</link><site>news</site><name>changes-myucsc.png</name><file-size>102517</file-size><width>760</width><height>364</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Coming this Summer!

UC Santa Cruz works hard to create a campus climate that supports and values everyone. As a university committed to inquiry and new ideas, we cherish freedom of speech. However, we deplore all language that is hostile or prejudicial to any groups, including anti-semitic language.</p>
<p>Campus leaders reached out to Santa Cruz Hillel as soon as the allegations surfaced. Our Office of Student Conduct is also following up on the incident, and the investigation may lead to judicial action. What is alleged to have occurred is at odds with with our Principles of Community. We take this seriously.</p>

McNulty)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Partnership with California State Parks and Friends group supports restoration of historic rancho hacienda; visitors welcome on Public Archaeology Day June 3</article-subhead><article-text>On a recent overcast Saturday morning, small clusters of students huddled around plots of exposed earth at <a href="http://www.thatsmypark.org/visit/castro-adobe-project/">Castro Adobe State Historic Park</a>, carefully scraping away dirt in a meticulous search for clues to life on the hacienda more than 150 years ago.<br/>
 <br/>
 The centerpiece of the park is a two-story adobe that has undergone years of renovation. But before the building can be opened to the public, park officials need to complete an archaeological assessment of the grounds to identify areas for protection.<br/>
 <br/>
 In a unique partnership, UC Santa Cruz is collaborating with <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/">California State Parks</a>, <a href="http://www.thatsmypark.org/">Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks</a>, and a private environmental consulting firm to get students in the field to help. In the process, students gain valuable hands-on experience in archaeology, and the artifacts they uncover help answer important scientific and cultural questions.<br/>
 <br/>
 "There's a lot of hidden history on this land," said undergraduate Janeth Montenegro, a third-year student majoring in anthropology and philosophy. "Who lived here? What did they do, what did they eat?" Sifting through dirt excavated by her classmates, Montenegro said she hadn't known what to expect when she signed up for the class. Interviewing stakeholders had piqued her interest in ethnographic work, and getting her hands in the dirt exposed her to the reality of archaeology. "So far it's interesting. I like it."<br/>
 <br/>
 The Castro Adobe is the only remaining building of the Rancho era in the Pajaro Valley&#8212;and the only two-story adobe in Santa Cruz County; the Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks undertook the restoration in order to preserve it and make it available for the public.<br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a great collaboration," said Jessica Kusz, historic preservation project manager for the Friends group. "We're building a state historic park, and the students are becoming part of that. They are helping us define the site, and their work will guide us as we decide where to place trails and interpretive materials."<br/>
 <br/>
 Sarah Peelo, a UC Santa Cruz alumna (Ph.D., anthropology, 2009) who is teaching the field class, called the partnership "a community archaeology project in the truest sense." Her firm, <a href="http://www.albionenvironmental.com/">Albion Environmental</a>, assessed the adobe structure last year, with student volunteers pitching in on their own time. When it came time to evaluate the grounds surrounding the building, Peelo and the Anthropology Department saw the opportunity to collaborate with State Parks and the Friends group.<br/>
 <br/>
 Peelo described the site as "super rich," explaining that ground-penetrating radar directed the student crews to areas of interest, including the remains of a building foundation, another structure, and multiple refuse pits.<br/>
 <br/>
 "One of the big questions we're trying to answer this season is 'How were they using this landscape beyond the adobe building?'" said Peelo. "It's bigger than the architectural infrastructure. How were they living on the landscape, how were they getting what they needed?"<br/>
 <br/>
 Archaeological analysis reveals clues to diet, trade, and interactions with other regions and cultural systems. "The Castro family lived through the Spanish Mission era and into the American period with the Gold Rush. How is this different from the missions, pueblos, and presidios?," asked Peelo.<br/>
 <br/>
 Crouched over a shallow dirt pit staked out with string, several students were getting a feel for the tedious nature of excavation.<br/>
 Each layer of dirt is carefully removed, bucket by bucket, then sifted through a fine-mesh screen. <br/>
 <br/>
 "We might not find much for the first two or three levels," said Alec Apodaca, a senior anthropology major whose past field experience qualified him as a "crew chief." There's a lot more to archaeology than digging, he added, noting the detailed recordkeeping and descriptions of soils, vegetation, and topography, as well as survey work and interviewing of stakeholders that are part of the Castro Adobe project. <br/>
 <br/>
 Eighteen students enrolled in the class, including Adelisa Coronado, a junior who is majoring in art history with a minor in visual culture. "I thought it would be cool to try out what I've learned about in the classroom," she said.<br/>
 <br/>
 Steve Cheatham Marvelli had read a lot about the site and the Mission era but was somewhat underwhelmed by the artifacts the team was uncovering. "All we're finding is pieces of wood, but it's fun to get in the dirt," he said. "It's fun to think we might find something."<br/>
 <br/>
 Excavation doesn't appeal to everyone, said J. Cameron Monroe, associate professor of anthropology who developed the field-course model.<br/>
 <br/>
 "Archaeology is a hands-on field, and you've got to get out and collect data to understand it," he said. "Students either get hooked or decide they don't want to do archaeology anymore."<br/>
 <br/>
 Field experience makes graduates infinitely more marketable, and it's key to diversifying the field, as well, said Monroe. "Field schools are potential roadblocks to attracting diverse participants, because they typically take place over the summer and cost $4,000 or more in tuition and fees," he said. "With travel and lost wages, it's a gateway that closes off opportunity for students from low- and middle-income families."<br/>
 <br/>
 A few years ago, Monroe and Anthropology Professor Diane Gifford-Gonzalez set out to offer a local field course during the school year to provide a low-cost alternative. "Field experience is absolutely key to getting a job after graduation or graduate school," said Monroe. "This class is a cost-effective, affordable pathway to getting a job after school. It's a very popular component of the anthropology major."<br/>
 <br/>
 The emphasis is on learning how to excavate and analyze artifacts, not on removing massive amounts of material. The trend in California archaeology is to make sure everything that's removed gets looked at&#8212;rather than warehoused in boxes, unstudied, for decades. <br/>
 <br/>
 "California has a curation crisis, so we are leaving a lot of material in place," said Monroe. "We are trying to do ethical and responsible archaeology." <br/>
 <br/>
 This type of work, called cultural resource management, is the fastest-growing area of archaeology in North America, said Monroe. It's a mandatory component of development projects from government roads to cell-tower construction. <br/>
 <br/>
 Before the end of the quarter, students will have analyzed each artifact and prepared full reports for the state archives. "Students only get the full value of the experience if they go through the process of data entry and analysis, too," said Monroe. "Students come out of our program knowing how to do things. It's not just theoretical."<br/>

the latest public event presented by UCSC&#8217;s Institute for Humanities Research (IHR). <br/>
<p>The occasion was <em>Radical Jewish Politics: From Marx to Bernie</em>, the second installment of the IHR&#8217;s new &#8220;UCSC Night at the Museum&#8221; series for the local community.</p>
<p>It offered a discussion of the history of radical Jewish politics--inspired by both the centennial of the Russian Revolution in 2017 and the stunning electoral success of Bernie Sanders, which has led to a renewed interest in socialism in the United States.</p>
<p>The evening featured a public conversation with UC Santa Cruz alumnus Tony Michels--professor&#160;of American Jewish History&#160;at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, author of <em>A Fire in Their Hearts: Yiddish Socialists in New York</em>, and editor of <em>Jewish Radicals: A Documentary History</em>.</p>
<p>His talk was followed by a Q &amp; A, moderated by UCSC assistant professor of history and Jewish studies, Alma Heckman<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This is the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution,&#8221; Michels noted at the beginning of his presentation. &#8220;Vladimir Putin is not marking it, but that shouldn&#8217;t stop us in Santa Cruz from talking about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A graduate of UC Santa Cruz in 1989 with a B.A. in politics (and also an avid surfer for four decades), Michels is currently finishing up a book about the relationship of American Jews to Soviet Russia between the 1920s and 1960s.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, he responded to a question about the effect of the recent presidential election on anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been surprised by the extent of anti-Semitism stirred up by the Trump campaign,&#8221; said Michels. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a resurgence, but I think it&#8217;s been a very traditional, far-right, often racist, anti-Semitism. What&#8217;s new is that it has been mobilized by a national figure. What we&#8217;re seeing in Trump may be more serious than a pendulum swing to the right.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The IHR's Night at the Museum</strong> series was created because of the community&#8217;s positive response to previous IHR public events such as the <em>Questions That Matter</em> series held downtown at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our greater goals is to engage with the community on issues that are timely and important like the presidential election,&#8221; said IHR director Nathaniel Deutsch. &#8220;This event put the unprecedented success of Bernie Sanders in a wider historical perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>But IHR managing director Irena Poli&#263; noted that community engagement is more than just renting a space for an event downtown.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about finding the right partner for the event,&#8221; said Poli&#263;. &#8220;We want to bring the humanities to interested audiences at our local cultural institutions. The idea is to bring events to different spaces and venues where different kinds of audiences are comfortable attending,&#8221; she added.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/night-at-museum.html</url><title>UCSC Night at the Museum to spotlight African American art and history</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4700e99d807270177c20a6475b173b4a"><name>koret-slam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Koret scholars present research at poster slam</title><summary>The Koret Scholars Undergraduate Research Slam will feature poster presentations about topics as diverse as a protein link to heart disease, female authorship in science fiction and horror genres, and the qualitative impact that research opportunities can have on the undergrad experience.</summary><keywords>research, undergraduate, student success, literature, science, </keywords><start-date>1495836000000</start-date><display-name>Research</display-name><path>/2017/05/koret-slam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/koret-slam</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1495839859774</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496177308186</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value><value>Linguistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer Pittman</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/tuesday-newsday/2017/may-30/images/krystal-mendez.jpg</path><link>site://news/tuesday-newsday/2017/may-30/images/krystal-mendez.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>krystal-mendez.jpg</name><display-name>krystal-mendez.jpg</display-name><file-size>288855</file-size><width>400</width><height>623</height></image><image-alt>Krystal Mendez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/tuesday-newsday/2017/may-30/images/krystal-mendez-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/tuesday-newsday/2017/may-30/images/krystal-mendez-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>krystal-mendez-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>krystal-mendez-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15633</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Krystal Mendez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Krystal Mendez, a graduating senior majoring in literature, used the scholarship money to help her hunt down the original translation of <em>The Monk: A Romance</em>, a Gothic novel published by Matthew Gregory Lewis in 1796.

<p>The <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4116">year-end event</a> will feature poster presentations about topics as diverse as a protein link to heart disease, female authorship in science fiction and horror genres, and the qualitative impact that research opportunities can have on the undergrad experience.</p>
<p>The greater community is invited to attend the free event, which takes place at the McHenry Library and caps off <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/index.html">Student Achievement Week</a> (June 5&#8211;9). Students will be on hand during a reception and to talk about their projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students will be showcasing research from a wide-variety of disciplines on campus,&#8221; said Sara Sanchez, coordinator of Undergraduate Honors and Research Opportunities in the Office of Campus Advising Coordination. &#8220;The goal of the Koret Scholars program is to offer more research opportunities to undergraduate students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/node/175">50 students were accepted</a> into this new undergraduate research program funded by a $1 million, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/11/koret-scholarships.html">three-year grant from the Koret Foundation</a>. The 30-year-old San Francisco-based organization focuses on supporting anchor institutions in the greater Bay area and strengthening the Jewish community. Each student received a $1,500 scholarship and up to $500 for research expenses.&#160;Faculty and graduate student mentors also received stipends.</p>
<p>Forrest Nichols (College Nine), a chemistry major graduating in June with a minor in biology has been investigating an alternative catalyst that could be used in fuel cells and next generation vehicles. The scholarship funded each new experimental material and allowed him to focus more hours on school rather than on a part-time job.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been going good,&#8221; Nichols said, noting that he keeps trying new materials and new procedures and recently began exploring redwood bark at the suggestion of his mentor on the project Shaowei Chen, a chemistry professor. &#8220;It&#8217;s really strengthened my understanding of the scientific method. It&#8217;s given me an idea of working on my own project and how it&#8217;s up to me to decide the next move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krystal Mendez (College Nine), a graduating senior majoring in literature, used the scholarship money to help her hunt down the original translation of <em>The Monk: A Romance</em>, a Gothic novel published by Matthew Gregory Lewis in 1796. She found the much-needed 1797 French translation at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at UC Los Angeles and says it was central to her research on how the female body is portrayed and how perceptions of the female body begin to shift in each of three French translations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#160;often seems that&#160;people are unsure about what&#160;research exactly means in the humanities,&#8221; Mendez said. &#8220;Receiving the scholarship kind of validated me as a scholar. It truly did mean a lot when I found out I was able to&#160;receive this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research experience also helped Mendez discover what&#160;literary&#160;research entails. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a&#160;challenging experience, but&#160;also rewarding. I can see&#160;more clearly where I see myself going in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scholarship program, which is sponsored by the divisions of Student Success, Undergraduate Education, Graduate Studies, and Humanities, is responding to a growing body of research that indicates undergraduate research increases student success outcomes and provides a better educational experience. One group of Koret scholars has created a survey to learn more about students&#8217; experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to get at what those benefits of being a researcher are, especially for underserved students,&#8221; said Elyse Fischground (Merrill College), a Community Studies major who is one of three undergraduates involved with the Koret Scholarship Connection to Student Success&#160;project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;ll come up with some interesting data about how it affects people&#8217;s sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and whether they enjoyed it,&#8221; Fischground said. &#8220;It definitely has been true that since I&#8217;ve been part of a research project, I have felt a stronger connection to my school and I&#8217;ve also felt stronger in my ability to succeed and follow through with a project.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="513aa48f807270177c20a64790f70c42"><name>p4p-town-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upcoming Pay for Performance (P4P) Town Hall Series</title><summary>Staff Human Resources and the Pay for Performance workgroup has developed an electronic performance appraisal tool this year for our campus</summary><start-date>1495782000000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming Pay for Performance (P4P) Town Hall Series</display-name><path>/2017/05/p4p-town-hall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/p4p-town-hall</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1496011415326</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496011415326</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Staff Human Resources and the Pay for Performance workgroup has developed an electronic performance appraisal tool this year for our campus.

 <br/>
 The chair was established this year with gifts from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation and a matching contribution from the UC Office of the President, in partnership with Mark Headley (BA, politics and economics, Stevenson &#8217;83) and his wife Christina Pehl.<br/>
 <br/>
 The new endowed chair honors Mark Headley&#8217;s father, a longtime administrator at the UC Office of the President. Based at Rachel Carson College, the chair was established to support the work of a faculty member dedicated to educating students about the conceptual and applied aspects of environmental science and stewardship.<br/>
 <br/>
 For the Headley family, the endowed chair is a tangible way to advance undergraduate education and support students who are taking on today's challenges of social responsibility and the environment. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our family is tremendously pleased and honored to join with the Webster Foundation to support the vital work of Rachel Carson College and UC Santa Cruz," said Headley. "This chair is a perfect legacy for my father, who not only spent his life working in the UC system but was lifted up from poverty by it."<br/>
 <br/>
 Headley was joined in attendance at the investiture by his mother, Jane; his wife, Christina; his brothers Dean and David; his children Nora and Dean; and his nephews Ryan and Eliot&#8212;an environmental studies student who just transferred to UC Santa Cruz from Cabrillo College. <br/>
 <br/>
 Lipschutz, who joined the faculty in 1990, is in his fifth year as provost of Rachel Carson College. His scholarly interests encompass global political economy with an emphasis on U.S. economic and military policy, changing forms of war, global governance, environmental politics, and sustainability.<br/>
 <br/>
 "I cannot begin to tell you what an honor and thrill it is to be chosen as the inaugural holder of the Robert R. Headley Chair of Integral Ecology and Environmental Justice at Rachel Carson College," Lipschutz said during the ceremony, which took place in the courtyard of Rachel Carson College.<br/>
 <br/>
 As the chair holder, Lipschutz looks forward to advancing the college's theme of "environment and society" by giving undergraduates rich learning and research opportunities. Lipschutz's own work acknowledges the links between environmental protection and restoration, poverty, social justice, the rights of the disenfranchised, and the role of engaged, activist citizens. <br/>
 <br/>
 Lipschutz was instrumental in the renaming last year of Rachel Carson College, formerly College Eight, which was made possible by a gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation. As provost, he approached Alec and Claudia Webster about naming the college after the crusading writer whose book Silent Spring documented the devastating environmental impacts of the widespread use of pesticides, including DDT. Lipschutz was also instrumental in establishing the campus's new minor in sustainability studies, as well as a new two-unit class called "STEM Success" designed to help students who want to major in STEM fields&#8212;science, technology, engineering, and mathematics&#8212;succeed in the prerequisites necessary to qualify for those majors; it is offered jointly to students at Rachel Carson College and Oakes College.<br/>
 <br/>
 Given his familiarity with the college and its needs, Lipschutz is uniquely suited to hold the chair, said Chancellor George Blumenthal, who noted that it is the first chair to be affiliated with one of the campus's residential colleges&#8212;and appears to be the first in the UC system named for a UC staff member.<br/>
 <br/>
 "Robert Headley devoted his professional life to the University of California," said Blumenthal. "Nearly all of his 40 years of service were in the Office of the President's systemwide personnel administration." <br/>
 <br/>
 Robert Headley, who died in 2001, developed salary structures, retirement policies, and affirmative action guidelines for staff. "The Robert Headley Presidential Chair recognizes and celebrates Bob's many decades of service to the UC system," said Blumenthal, who presented medals to Mark Headley and his mother Jane.<br/>
 <br/>
 Blumenthal has made fundraising for faculty chairs a priority of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which has raised more than $316 million for the campus. <br/>
 <br/>
 Headley and Pehl are generous, longtime supporters of the campus whose gifts support student opportunity, social justice, and the environment. In 2014, they established the Dorothy Everett Chair to honor a woman who provided high-level support to four UC presidents and was a close colleague of Robert Headley's. <br/>
 <br/>
 The Dorothy Everett Chair supports a program that combines practical training in information technology with student-driven social justice ventures. Student interns take workshops to build their technological expertise, which they then share with nonprofit organizations and other entities that lack computing infrastructure. This popular, grassroots program helps bridge the digital divide while empowering students as agents of social change. A subsequent gift from Headley and Pehl changed the name of the Global Information Internship Program (GIIP) to the <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/">Dorothy Everett Program for Global Information and Social Entrepreneurship</a>.<br/>

They track graduation and retention rates and the number of graduates who secure employment within their field of study.</p>
<p>But public institutions are increasingly focused on another key metric&#8212;the degree to which they enable upward mobility.</p>
<p>For many professors, administrators, and outside commentators, it is vital that U.S. higher education afford people from lower income households, and from traditionally underrepresented ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, equitable educational opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is one of the most important things that the United States should be doing in the 21st century,&#8221; said interim Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, Martin Berger. &#8220;In order to unlock the full potential of the country, you need to do more than educate the same elite population generation after generation. Doing so limits our ability to innovate and problem solve. The more heterogeneous our approach, the more creative our solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this vital mission in mind, UC Santa Cruz will launch the <a href="https://firstgen.ucsc.edu">First-Gen Faculty (FGF) campaign</a> during Student Achievement week, which starts June 5. This initiative is aimed at encouraging professors on campus to identify themselves as first generation&#8212;the first in their families to graduate from a U.S. four-year college or university.</p>
<p>So far, 54 professors have identified themselves as first-generation faculty, and 41 faculty have signed on as supporters.</p>
<p>Berger is in the latter group, but Rebecca Covarrubias, faculty in psychology and a prime mover behind the campaign, knows firsthand the trials and triumphs of being a first-generation student.</p>
<p>Covarrubias&#8217; childhood in a lower income, primarily Mexican American community in Phoenix meant that when she finally reached the University of Arizona, she was bringing along her family and her community. Yet, a firm sense of belonging proved elusive once on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only did I miss my family, but I also wasn&#8217;t prepared for college,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t use office hours or talk to professors because I didn&#8217;t think I had to.&#8221;</p>
<p>These strategies&#8212;seeking out faculty, forming study groups, attending office hours&#8212;are key to student success, but activities that some first-generation students may only learn about once on campus. &#8220;There are many hidden rules about how to navigate the university,&#8221; Covarrubias said. &#8220;We have great programs and people on campus who work hard to unpack these rules for students. But, if we are really going to serve students, the institution, as a whole, needs to be responsible for bringing resources to students.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the T-shirt campaign, where first-generation faculty and supporters will don the same distinctive shirts and buttons, is so important.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about raising awareness of the large number of first-generation students on our campus, and also about raising visibility of an often invisible group,&#8221; Covarrubias said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t always know who the first-generation students are in your classroom. In drawing attention to the shared identities among students and faculty, we can send a clear message that we want you here, that you belong here, and you will succeed here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The psychology professor says she is further convinced that young students who see people belonging to their same cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds occupying a position like university professor helps instill a sense of possibility central to successful careers in higher education.</p>
<p>Jaye Padgett, interim Vice Provost for the Division of Student Success, agrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Studies show that certain students who are predisposed to feeling like they don&#8217;t belong are less likely to graduate, even if they are academically on par with their peers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Padgett knows the feeling well. He is a first-generation college graduate, raised in a low-income household with a father who never graduated high school and a mother who got a diploma but not a college degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lacked &#8216;cultural capital&#8217;,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how to pronounce a word like &#8216;poignant&#8217; and I had no idea who Richard Strauss was. I felt that. I had friends, but I also felt a little isolated.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the initiative is designed to help puncture that sense of isolation and replace it with a sense of belonging, Covarrubias said the initiative also serves to educate professors about how to recognize the cultural strengths of first-generation students.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not about student deficiencies. This is about institutional deficiencies in recognizing what students bring with them to our classrooms,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Many first-generation students come from families where they are depended upon to provide vital services such as translation, or supplemental income.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of these students work two or three jobs to support themselves and their families. They are doing incredible things that we don&#8217;t acknowledge in the classroom. We have a lot to learn from our first generation students,&#8221; Covarrubias said.</p>
<p>These students are highly motivated and come to college with a firm purpose.</p>
<p>However, professors are trained to identify students who speak up in class, effectively use office hours, use sophisticated networking to score internships, or rely on recommendations as proof of proficiency.</p>
<p>Covarrubias said teaching professors how to identify and recognize diverse strengths and skill sets in students will result in a system that serves and includes a more diverse student body.</p>
<p>Berger agrees that the initiative's primary goal is two-fold: to make students feel a sense of belonging and ownership over their education and to help teachers understand the challenges and cultural wealth of first generation students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long way to go to build better connections between students and faculty and to improve the mentoring first generation students receive,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Shifting demographics in California make crafting policies that address the challenges of first-generation students and the professors who teach and guide them more urgent than ever.</p>
<p>Of the students enrolled throughout the University of California system in fall 2016, 42 percent came from households where neither parent had graduated college. The number is the same for UC Santa Cruz. In 2016, 42 percent of the entering class are vying to become the first in their families to graduate with a college degree.</p>
<p>The FGF Campaign begins the week of June 5.</p>

We do it through research, through teaching, and through activism. The exchange of ideas&#8212;sometimes done quietly, sometimes not&#8212;helps to move society and our campus forward.</p>
<p>Over the years we&#8217;ve made many changes on campus after hearing thoughtful and reasoned arguments from students. We are ultimately here as a university to support them, and it&#8217;s essential we remain attuned to their needs. A university is a dynamic environment. I want to be sure our services, programs, and policies are serving students.</p>
<p>For that reason, we have staff across campus committed to working directly with students to ensure that their voices are heard. They can connect students with the appropriate administrators, guiding them to the proper avenues to effect change.</p>
<p>Our Division of Student Success, overseen by interim Vice Provost Jaye Padgett, offers a host of services that aid our student body: Those include our <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Office of Campus Life and Dean of Students</a>, <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/retention" target="_blank">eight Student Success Centers</a>, and <a href="http://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">six resource centers</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Teresa Maria Linda Scholz, our campus diversity officer for staff and students, is available to meet with those who have concerns about our <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/index.html" target="_blank">campus climate</a>.</p>
<p>However, I want to be clear: While I support First Amendment rights, I do not endorse efforts to halt the normal work of the university, such as blocking campus entrances or taking over a building.</p>
<p>Such actions are not protected speech under the U.S. or California constitutions. They can keep students from learning, faculty from conducting research, and staff from performing the essential business of this university.</p>
<p>Moving forward, people who choose to engage in conduct that obstructs or disrupts teaching, research, or other university-sponsored activities violate university codes of conduct and will be subject to discipline under our student handbook, employment or other applicable policies. Disciplinary measures can include warnings, suspensions, or&#8212;in the most egregious of cases&#8212;expulsion or dismissal.</p>
<p>We also must strive to be respectful and civil in our dialogue, as described in our <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Communit</a>y. Allegations of hateful remarks directed at certain groups by others in our community are deeply troubling. That behavior is at odds with our goal of having a welcoming and open campus.</p>
<p>I ask our campus community to keep these expectations in mind as we move ahead.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive campus community we aspire to takes work, but it is something I believe is eminently achievable if we adhere to our principles. They allow us to respectfully discuss our differences while also acknowledging our common humanity.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="601e03ef807270177c20a647a8709acb"><name>childcare-services-employee-housing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planned expansion in child care services and on-campus employee housing</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is planning to build a new child care center and expand service to employees.

In addition, we are planning to expand on-campus employee housing options.</p>
<p>For seven years, we have been the only campus without on-campus child care for faculty and staff. This&#8212;rightfully&#8212;has been a top concern of our Academic Senate and Staff Advisory Board, and a priority for us as campus leaders. Providing this service helps recruit and retain talented faculty and staff, just one of many benefits. Expanding on-campus employee housing options is another element of enhancing our ability to recruit and retain employees. These projects are important steps forward in supporting our campus community.</p>
<p>The expansion of child care is being incorporated into our request for developers to deliver Student Housing West, which will bring approximately 3,000 beds to the western portion of campus. Student Housing West is being delivered through a public-private partnership, and the new housing units will allow us to restore lounge spaces and provide more housing for upper division undergraduates and graduate students in addition to serving students with families. The first new beds will be online for fall 2020. We've asked developers to incorporate a new child care facility that can serve up to 140 children, ranging from infants to school age. The exact child care program, size, and cost will be developed in the months to come. We will work with faculty, staff, and student representatives to refine the program and work through the financial analysis. The child care facility will be open to faculty, staff, and students.</p>
<p>Like some other UC child care facilities, ours will be managed and run by an independent, licensed child care provider. Once the newly constructed facility is ready to open, the existing program, which only serves children of our student parents, will discontinue. The program will transition to one that serves children of our students, staff, and faculty. We are striving to ensure that the transition between operations will be as smooth as possible for the families of the children being served as well as for the Early Education Services team. Towards such end, we will work with staff members who may wish to leave campus or who may wish to work elsewhere on campus.</p>
<p>The expansion of employee housing on campus will also be undertaken through a developer. We will form a committee that incorporates faculty and staff who will be charged with developing a request for proposal (RFP). The goal is to have an RFP ready by the end of fall quarter.</p>
<p>We will share more information on both of these projects in the months to come.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="60b1f7df807270177c20a6478879d2ae"><name>stem-diversity-graduation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>STEM Diversity graduation honors student achievement</title><summary>"You are already catalyzing change," a speaker told students at the end-of-year celebration for graduating seniors and others in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math.</summary><keywords>STEM Diversity</keywords><start-date>1496270700000</start-date><display-name>STEM Diversity graduation honors student achievement</display-name><path>/2017/05/stem-diversity-graduation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/stem-diversity-graduation</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1496270893553</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496271253090</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/stem-diversity-graduation.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/stem-diversity-graduation.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stem-diversity-graduation.jpg</name><display-name>stem-diversity-graduation.jpg</display-name><file-size>49302</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Celebrants at this year's STEM Diversity graduation</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/stem-diversity-graduation-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/stem-diversity-graduation-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stem-diversity-graduation-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>stem-diversity-graduation-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3604</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Celebrants at this year's STEM Diversity graduation</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Celebrants at this year's&#160;STEM Diversity graduation</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>'You are already catalyzing change,' speaker tells students at end-of-year celebration for graduating seniors and others in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math</article-subhead><article-text><p>Forty UC Santa Cruz STEM Diversity students, some sporting mortarboards decorated with microscopes and circuit boards, listened Friday as UC Irvine School of Medicine professor and Santa Cruz alum Sergio Armando Villalta urged them to be catalysts for change.</p>
<p>His remarks were part of an end-of-the-year celebration for graduating seniors, doctoral students, and those finishing up a year of research in preparation for graduate school in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. Fifty-eight students were in this year&#8217;s STEM Diversity cohort, according to Yulianna Ortega, programs director.</p>
<p>Villalta (Merrill '02, biochemistry and molecular biology), who is assistant professor of physiology and biophysics at the UC Irvine School of Medicine and is researching how cells contribute to tissue repair in degenerative and autoimmune diseases, told the story of how his mother, who arrived alone in the United States from Colombia with $100 in her pocket, was an agent of change for her family. She learned English, got a job, and made sure her children got an education.</p>
<p>&#8220;She carved a path for her family,&#8221; Villalta said.</p>
<p>In the same way, he told graduates, they have the ability to transform their own histories.</p>
<p>Recounting how his path to success was not linear, he said the obstacles he faced taught him important lessons.</p>
<p>Be passionate and never get comfortable, he urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are feeling comfortable, it&#8217;s a sign you are not challenging yourself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Have faith in yourself, he told graduates. Strike a balance between humility and confidence, be respectful of other people&#8217;s opinions, and be patient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Collectively, these things transformed me,&#8221; Villalta said. &#8220;These lessons allowed me to grow further as an individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make your own path,&#8221; he told the gathering. &#8220;Make your own list of lessons and remember that, as you sit here today, you are already catalyzing change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The celebration, which included dinner, celebratory videos, and the presentation of handmade stoles to each graduate, was designed to honor students&#8217; achievements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many students have overcome multiple struggles to attain the STEM degree,&#8221; Ortega said. &#8220;We want them to remember they are part of a much larger community of support and that staff and faculty are dedicated to their success and are proud of their accomplishments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reyna Montoya (Oakes &#8217;17, biology) said she was happy to be graduating and was looking forward to applying to dental school. She grew up in Oxnard, the daughter of a single working mother, and was the first in her family to go to college.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty excited,&#8221; she said of graduation. &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked so hard for four-and-a-half years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nancy Sanchez (Cowell &#8217;17, MCD biology), who grew up in Fairfield, Calif., said she planned to apply for graduate school while Alejandro Anaya (Oakes &#8217;17, MCD biology) said he was off for a summer research internship at the National Institutes of Health with the goal of returning to his hometown of Watsonville to work as a physician and be a role model, helping others to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Angel Resendez, a 28-year-old graduate student in chemistry, said the celebration capped a whirlwind year that included getting his Ph.D. and quickly starting a post-doc research position at Stanford University, where he is doing drug discovery work.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, he said, he worked with Professor of Organic Chemistry Bakthan Singaram studying alternative and less-expensive methods to measure sugars to help determine the health of the human gut.</p>
<p>With the cheers echoing through the decorated hall and families snapping cell phone photos, UC Santa Cruz Dean of Physical and Biological Sciences Paul Koch told the crowd, &#8220;This is a great day for our students."</p>
The end of the year, he said, "is wonderful because we get to celebrate your accomplishments&#8212;but it&#8217;s also bittersweet because you&#8217;re leaving us."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="611cecf8807270177c20a647f000ce35"><name>athletics-fee</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Athletics fee referendum passes</title><summary>Measure 68, which proposed a $38.50-per-quarter fee to support the NCAA athletics program and provide access to athletic-related activities to students who meet the Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP) criteria, passed with 79 percent of voting students supporting the fee.</summary><keywords>athletics, fee, funding, </keywords><start-date>1496275200000</start-date><display-name>Athletics</display-name><path>/2017/05/athletics-fee</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/athletics-fee</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1496277903223</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496784455682</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/athletics-fee-grb-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/athletics-fee-grb-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>athletics-fee-grb-400.jpg</name><display-name>athletics-fee-grb-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>121859</file-size><width>400</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Chancellor and Paul Simposon</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/athletics-fee-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/athletics-fee-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>athletics-fee-80px.jpg</name><display-name>athletics-fee-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>16050</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Chancellor George Blumenthal, left, and Paul Simpson after the results were announced.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/05/images/athletics-fee-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/05/images/athletics-fee-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>athletics-fee-400px.jpg</name><display-name>athletics-fee-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>227284</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Students</image-alt><image-caption>Athletes gathered at the West Field House to hear the results.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Students overwhelmingly voted to put the UC Santa Cruz intercollegiate athletics program on a sustainable path forward.</p>
<p>Measure 68, which proposed a $38.50-per-quarter fee to support the NCAA athletics program and provide access to athletic-related activities to students who meet the Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP) criteria, passed with 79 percent of voting students supporting the fee. Thirty-nine percent of students voted on the measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intercollegiate athletics at UC Santa Cruz now have a bright future. I&#8217;m glad to see the program on a sustainable path forward&#8212;and to see that students recognize the value our intercollegiate programs bring to campus,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "I commend the campus community, the student athletes, EOP leadership, our alumni, and our foundation board members for all their hard work in supporting athletics."</p>
<p>The fee will provide the NCAA Division III program with approximately $1.1 million beginning in fall 2017. Approximately $160,000 will be generated to support athletic activities of student who meet EOP criteria, approximately 40 percent of the student body. The fee is scheduled to sunset is 2042.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developing this new business model required all of us to think differently about how to deliver a quality program that we can be proud of,&#8221; said Andrea Willer, executive director for the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports. &#8220;It required a campuswide conversation and support from many units on campus. I am thrilled that so many stakeholders were able to come together and work together for a positive outcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current NCAA program consists of 15 men and women&#8217;s teams, which have about 300 students on the rosters. The average GPA well exceeds the campus average and the program boasts a 100 percent academic retention rate for the past five years. The teams have gone on to compete in championships and students have received scholar-athlete honors.</p>
<p>Despite all the success on the field, the intercollegiate athletics program has been grappling with a deficit for the past several years, and campus leaders have asked that a sustainable funding model be developed that reduces the reliance on central campus funds. The program costs roughly $2.2 million with coach and trainer salaries (72 percent) and travel (16 percent) being the most significant expenses.</p>
<p>The new business model for intercollegiate athletics was developed in collaboration with students, faculty, staff, alumni, and campus supporters. The model proposes the new fee; anticipates an ongoing campus contribution of $500,000 per year; and anticipates growing revenue from licensing and fundraising.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strongly believe we have built an innovative business model for intercollegiate athletics that will allow the program to flourish for the foreseeable future,&#8221; said Paul Simpson, an alumnus who helped to develop the plan. &#8220;The Alumni Council was heavily vested in this process and I&#8217;m happy we were able to play a positive role on this outcome. There have been numerous councilors over the years that have advocated for the intercollegiate athletics program, and I hope they are proud that their advocacy has help lead us to this moment in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an honor to represent this prestigious campus as an intercollegiate athlete, and I&#8217;m ecstatic that these current student athletes and future student athletes will have an opportunity to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two committees&#8212;one commissioned by the Academic Senate and one of alumni and foundation board members&#8212;extensively researched intercollegiate athletics and issued separate reports. Both committees, among many recommendations, asked that the campus consider every reasonable measure to keep the intercollegiate athletics program, which started in 1981.</p>
<p>Last year, UC Santa Cruz students showed strong support for the intercollegiate athletics&#8217; program, with 63 percent of voting undergraduates signaling that they would be willing to establish a new fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of our students,&#8221; Willer said. &#8220;Our student athletes have stayed committed to each other, to their teams, and to their campus. They were intricately involved in developing and executing the campaign and are 100 percent responsible for the overwhelming success of this measure.

<h3>"My family has been described as very 'modern' because I have two moms"</h3>
<p>Growing up on two disparate coasts, Santa Barbara and New York, the sisters started making the 3,000 mile trip back and forth at age 11 due to their parents&#8217; separation. &#8220;My family has been described as very &#8216;modern&#8217; because I have two moms,&#8221; says Julie. &#8220;My parents tried to make the transitions smooth, but separations are rarely easy. It was challenging being perpetually on the move&#8230;.During these years, I never felt like I was settled, or that I could unpack my things. This constant change of domestic space has been important in the work that I now make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up with a close relationship to Julie,&#8221; says Kristen. &#8220;We supported and confided in each other in the way that many kids do with their parents. By the age of 13 we could navigate LAX airport with our eyes closed!&#8221;</p>
<h3>A photography course planted a creative seed</h3>
<p>When it was time for high school, the sisters stayed in New York and attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts. This is where they both first discovered how to paint with oils, but in her senior year, Julie also took a photography course which planted a future creative seed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until I got to UC Santa Cruz that I started to focus on photography,&#8221; says Julie. &#8220;I had always been technically savvy, so photography was a good fit. I enjoyed the way my camera allowed me to explore more space and capture a subject over and over until I got the best image.&#8221;</p>
<p>During their freshman year at UCSC, the sisters&#8217; childhood home in Santa Barbara burned to the ground in a brush fire, which had a significant impact on both of them. &#8220;I developed a real respect for the power of nature and natural phenomena,&#8221; says Kristen. &#8220;To this day, I use my environmentally themed paintings as a way of communicating and critiquing current issues to members of my community and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A fragmented relationship with home</h3>
<p>For Julie, the event led her to start thinking about the importance of possessions that remind everyone of their past experiences. &#8220;Ever since [the fire], I have studied homes (often abandoned ones) and objects that I find as a way of exploring my own fragmented relationship with home,&#8221; says Julie. &#8220;At first, I thought this work was just about my lost home, but through deeper inquiry, I&#8217;ve learned that I hadn&#8217;t felt at home since I was very young. So I really lost the home long before the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of Julie&#8217;s best memories of UC Santa Cruz were when she helped organize a trip to the Sweeney Mountains Desert Research Center with a group of photographers. They were traveling through the Mojave Desert which left a lasting impression on her. &#8220;There were hundreds of abandoned houses and objects left behind in the barren landscape. Because of the heat and low humidity, everything in the desert seems almost frozen in time. If it weren&#8217;t for the rusting metal and strong winds that ravaged the structures, there would have been little indication of how much time had elapsed since the occupants fled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Julie also worked closely with photography professor Norman Locks and lecturer in photography, Ken Alley. &#8220;Both are remarkably knowledgeable teachers who knew when to give me space to work and when to offer additional support,&#8221; says Julie. &#8220;My experience would have been lacking without Ken&#8217;s quirky sense of humor and Norman&#8217;s insightful story telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>She favored UCSC because, after considering many art schools, decided that having a broader education would be more beneficial than spending a lot of money on tuition for a private school where her courses would be very specialized. &#8220;I also chose Santa Cruz because of the beauty of the area, mild winters, devoted faculty and staff, and excellent programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kristen recalls wanting to attend UCSC because of the campus experience it offered. &#8220;Coming from the big city, I was yearning for nature and fell in love with the fact that Santa Cruz had redwoods and a beach close by,&#8221; she says.</p>
<h3>Inspiration from the Monterey Bay Aquarium</h3>
<p>During her junior year at UCSC, she participated in an independent study project with a teacher who inspired her, Professor of Art/artist Frank Galuszka. Every week she would go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and paint the beautiful kelp forest exhibit there. &#8220;It was an amazing opportunity,&#8221; she says. She also was part of the&#160;<strong>Irwin Scholar Exhibition in 2012</strong>, as well as a program assistant at the Rachel Carson College events office (then known as College Eight).&#160; While in that position, she created an event called &#8220;Wear Your Awareness&#8221; which challenged students to put together costumes made from old clothes, recyclables, and trash for a fashion show.</p>
<p>Along with Professor Galuszka, Kristen had other UCSC lecturers who influenced her. &#8220;I was lucky to have Hanna Hannah and Miriam Hitchcock who nurtured my love of art and the environment, large scale painting acrylics, and mixed media,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>In the last few years, Julie has been exhibiting in group shows around the country and had several solo shows in Spokane, Washington, including the WAM (Women + Art + Media) Expo. For that show, she recreated an installation that she had made in graduate school called &#8220;Echoes of Home&#8221;, where she built a room and installed light boxes that illuminated images of abandoned houses and objects from the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>Julie also was an Artist in Residence at the Vermont Studio Center in 2015 and won Best In Show for her &#8220;Guess You Had To Be There&#8221; installation at the Peoria Gateway Building. In addition, she won Best Still Life in the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts&#8217; 2016 International Photography Competition and was awarded a Grants for Artists Projects (GAP) 2016 grant from the Artist Trust.</p>
<p>This past year, Kristen has shown her paintings in several galleries across the U.S. including WomanKraft and Union Gallery in Tucson, AZ; The Center for Fine Art Photography in Fort Collins, CO; The Art of Assembling Foundry Art Centre in St. Charles, MO; Hatch Gallery, Spokane, WA; Sikkema &amp; Jenkins in New York.</p>
<p>The sisters both have sage advice to share with students who strive to be artists. &#8220;Do not get too caught up in why your are doing something or what your classmates are doing,&#8221; says Julie. &#8220;Just keep working on your project and the deeper meaning will become apparent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would recommend getting to know your professors and seeing them as amazing resources,&#8221; says Kristen. &#8220;Because of the professional relationships I forged with my professors, I was able to do my independent study. I was also invited to engage students in studio visits and be a teaching assistant as an undergraduate student in a painting course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now residing in Tucson, Kristen has a successful business on&#160;<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/FlowershopStudio">Etsy</a>&#160;selling her exquisite, hand-made cards, and has started working towards her Masters in Social Work. She also continues to paint and have art exhibitions. Julie, who lives in Spokane, originally moved there for an AmeriCorps volunteer position and decided to stay. Besides her work, she enjoys being able to spend time recharging in her studio.</p>
<h3>Putting their talents together</h3>
<p>The sisters have recently started collaborating, putting their work together to produce striking digital composites which depict their shared history of environmental disaster by combining their interpretations of major loss.</p>
<p>With such individual and combined talent, Julie and Kristen Gautier-Downes have already made an impressive impact on the art world and no doubt will continue to do so. Their moms agree. &#8220;They are so proud of my sister and me,&#8221; says Julie. Adds Kristen, &#8220;My parents respect [us]. They are impressed by [our] dedication and motivation to make art and find ways to help and empower people.&#8221;</p>

<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our focus has been on student and staff safety from the start. No one was hurt, and the students and administrators communicated throughout. </span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though we have been working with underrepresented communities, including A/BSA, we acknowledge that we have not done enough to engage with them successfully. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student demonstrators raised a number of issues with campus leaders, issues we fundamentally agree upon. Students from historically underrepresented communities deal with real challenges on campus and in the community. These difficulties include things that many people take for granted, such as finding housing or even just a sense of community.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have long strived to have a diverse and inclusive student body at UC Santa Cruz. To that end, we&#8217;ve taken steps in recent years to support African, black and Caribbean-identified students. We&#8217;ve hired retention and recruitment specialists, and created a position for a counselor specializing in mental-health support for ABC students.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found common ground this week on housing issues. We offered a guarantee of up to four years of housing at the Rosa Parks African-American Theme House (RPAATH) to students from underrepresented communities who live there, and we will convert a lounge at the house back to its original purpose. We will build upon current diversity education by providing an orientation that educates students on diversity competency. And to demonstrate our commitment to ABC-identified students, we&#8217;ve agreed to paint RPAATH pan-African colors to increase their visibility and sense of community.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see these new measures as ways to meaningfully improve the ABC student experience here on campus &#8212; and in doing so improve our campus climate.</span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We support students exercising their First Amendment rights, but we do not endorse taking over buildings, which displaces university employees doing important work in support of the very students who entered the building. </span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protesters are in the process of leaving Kerr Hall. Staffers are asked to stay away from the building until further notice. We will communicate more information as it becomes available. </span></p>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you to staff and students for your patience and understanding this week in dealing with this issue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="65b510368072701752a34ca3bc817ff5"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2017/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/05/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1483470082076</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483470082076</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
