by outstanding faculty. </article-subhead><article-text><p>The always-popular Teach-In lecture series returns to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/">Alumni Weekend</a> this year, with button-pushing presentations about the role of the humanities in a "post-truth" world and the intriguing potentials of stem cell research.</p>
<p>The students in both classes can bring their intellectual curiosity but leave those exam booklets behind.</p>
<p>This series will be one of the many highlights of Alumni Weekend festivities, <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu">which take place April 28&#8211;30.</a> Those who wish to attend this fun-filled weekend may <a href="http://connect.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2409&amp;cid=4385">register here.</a></p>
<p>There is no need to cram all night beforehand for these Teach-Ins. Just show up and enjoy. But be prepared with a couple of questions to ask. This will guarantee a lively and far-ranging discussion.</p>
<p>In the past, Teach-Ins were held simultaneously; returning Slugs wished they could have taken a class that would teach them how to clone themselves so they could attend all the talks. But this year, the lectures are being held at different times at Stevenson College, meaning that it is technically possible to attend both lectures&#8212;providing that you register in advance to guarantee your spot.</p>
<p>The Teach-In lectures kick off on Saturday, April 29, at 1 p.m., at Stevenson College, room 150, with &#8220;<a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/teach-in-1-rejuvinate-now-stem-cells-at-uc-santa-cruz/">Rejuvenate Now: Stem Cell Research at UC Santa Cruz,</a>&#8221; a special talk by professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology Lindsay Hinck; professor of biomolecular engineering Camilla Forsberg; and assistant professor of biomolecular engineering Daniel Kim, who talk about the stem cell research taking place at the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells (IBSC) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Stem cells hold great promise for curing or mitigating the effects of many diseases and injuries. &#160;This talk will focus on three areas of stem cell research in particular: breast cancer, blood, and cellular reprogramming.</p>
<p>Attendees will learn how stem-progenitor cells that regulate breast development are targeted to become breast cancer stem cells, how stem cells &#8220;decide&#8221; to become a particular type of mature blood cell, and how this process can go haywire, causing disease in the process. Registration is required to attend this talk, and <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2409&amp;cid=4385">you can do so by visiting this link.</a>&#160;</p>
<p>While stem cell research can fight disease, the humanities can fight lies and distortions in the political arena.</p>
<p>In a Teach-In entitled &#8220;Ex Post Facto,&#8221; Gina Dent, associate professor of feminist studies, history of consciousness, and legal studies at UC Santa Cruz, will discuss <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/teach-in-2/">the role of the humanities in responding to the current discussion of &#8220;alternative facts.&#8221;</a> How can we develop a critical relationship to &#8220;facticity,&#8221; while preserving the ability to think and act politically? &#160;The talk starts at 2:45 p.m. at Stevenson College, room 175.</p>
<p>This discussion could not be more timely in this era of suspect sourcing and plastic realities.&#160;Register <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2409&amp;cid=4385">here for this Teach-In.</a></p>

<p>Pedro Cori, Alexander Formoso, and Cong Liu created a video game called <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/529140"><em>Ulama: Arena of the Gods</em></a>, which launched March 28. The game was &#8220;greenlit&#8221; by the Steam community in just 15 days. Steam Greenlight, part of Valve&#8217;s Steam digital distribution platform, is a way for users to help choose which games are added to the service.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made this game program for UCSC&#8217;s master&#8217;s degree program and by the end I thought it would make a good product,&#8221; said Cori, who acted as the creative director for the project. &#8220;So we decided to launch it commercially.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the team uploaded Ulama onto Steam, they weren&#8217;t sure if the concept would catch, but within the first two weeks the video game garnered 2,700 votes, out of which 800 were positive. Most of the other votes were neutral.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of positive comments in proportion to negative ones, so that definitely helped,&#8221; said Formoso, who acted as the project producer on the team.</p>
<p>Ulama is the brainchild of Cori. The gameplay is based on an ancient ballgame played by the Aztec and Mayan people. Only instead of people playing the games, the many deities that populate the myths of the ancient cultures face off.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father used to read from me from these illustrated books of myths and legends from Mesoamerican cultures,&#8221; Cori said. &#8220;When we were told we could make a game about whatever we wanted, I thought a ball game that incorporated these stories could work.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Cori developed the thematic aspects of the game, the rest of the team worked to bring his vision to life.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is how it worked: Pedro would come into the room and would tell us about this awesome idea,&#8221; Formoso said. &#8220;I would look at Cong and ask him, &#8216;How much time do you need to build that?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Cong Liu would give an estimate and Formoso would give it a thumbs up or down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the technical director of the team,&#8221; said Liu. &#8220;We&#8217;d have some technical issues and decisions to make about what kind of approach to the gameplay and that kind of stuff. And I&#8217;m responsible for the development and implementation for several of the core functions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liu&#8212;the &#8220;coding wizard&#8221;&#8212;also developed the artificial intelligence for the game.</p>
<p>Since graduating from the Silicon Valley-based master&#8217;s program last year, Liu was hired by Google, joining the team developing the company&#8217;s nascent virtual reality (VR) product line.</p>
<p>Liu commends the UC Santa Cruz program, and said the project he undertook with his two teammates was an integral aspect of being able to land his dream job.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was interviewing with Google, they were asking about my project, about Ulama, my responsibilities, and what code I was contributing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That project, with Pedro and Alex, it was a really good thing for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cori agrees.</p>
<p>He, too, is launching his own career in gaming, working for a VR gaming company in Seattle called Against Gravity. He has begun work on a VR game called Rec Room, which features the ability to play different recreational games in a virtual reality with the incorporation of a multi-player format.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ulama was a gold star on my portfolio,&#8221; Cori said.</p>
<p>Formoso works as a game programmer with Bohemia Interactive in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody can pay to put their game on Steam Greenlight, but the fact that we got approved says something,&#8221; Formoso said.</p>
<p>And while the three teammates undertook the master&#8217;s program and chose a commercial project for the express purpose of advancing their fledgling careers, they can&#8217;t help but be excited to see what happens now that Ulama is live.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting,&#8221; Formoso said. &#8220;You can go to Steam and our game is there next to <em>Infinity Warfare</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cori says the game won&#8217;t supplant <em>Call of Duty</em> or other popular de-facto multi-player games that dominate the market, but the game, which resembles the gameplay one finds in <em>Smash Bros.</em> or <em>Rocket League</em>, will be fun for people to play together.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built a casual, fun game&#8212;a family game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We envision a bunch of friends on the couch playing at party. That&#8217;s good enough for us.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="39f3e0038072701721a2b70e2b81f709"><name>campus-welfare</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tackling climate change of a different sort</title><summary>The Office of the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor is reconstituting the Campus Welfare Committee with a special focus on staff engagement, morales, and wellness. </summary><start-date>1491289200000</start-date><display-name>Staff morale</display-name><path>/2017/04/campus-welfare</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/campus-welfare</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1491325934234</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1491325981819</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I&#8217;m very pleased to announce the reconstitution of our Campus Welfare Committee.</p>
<p>Historically, the charge of this committee has been to understand the impacts of campus planning activities on the campus community. In the past, the group has focused on things like transportation, parking, and childcare. But after gathering input&#8212;through our strategic planning process Envision UC Santa Cruz, through Staff Advisory Board forums, and through discussions with campus leadership and so many of you&#8212;the decision was made by the executive vice chancellor&#8217;s office to shift the charge of the group to have a general focus on our campus climate.</p>
<p>We want this group to eventually get its arms around the campus climate in its broadest sense&#8212;for our faculty, staff, academic employees, undergraduate, and graduate students&#8212;and to be well-informed of the drivers that impact us all. And for the first two years (academic years 2016&#8211;17 and 2017&#8211;18), we want the committee to narrow its focus to staff engagement, morale, and wellness.</p>
<p>Why? A staff employee engagement survey done UC-wide revealed that employee engagement on our campus lags behind our sister campuses and is lower than our peers across the nation. While clearly the loss of knowledge through retirements and the decrease in staff due to budget reductions have had an impact on morale, it is also apparent that our systems for development, engagement, and support of a diverse and multi-generational workforce can be improved.</p>
<p>This new Campus Welfare Committee is being chaired by Sarah Latham, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. Expect to hear from Sarah in the coming months as the committee begins soliciting input and identifying the issues that impact staff engagement.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked the committee to provide me and my successor with a status report this coming June and a final report in December 2017 that includes work that has been done, findings, and potential &#8220;quick-wins&#8221; that could be implemented campuswide prior to the final recommendations. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to not only the group&#8217;s findings&#8212;but a potential roadmap to a more professionally satisfied and engaged staff.</p>
<p>The Campus Welfare Committee members are:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Abercia, Assistant Vice Provost and Chief of Staff, Undergraduate Education</li>
<li>Noriko Aso, Associate Professor, History</li>
<li>Rosa Chung, Department Manager, Baskin School of Engineering</li>

<p><strong>Murray Baumgarten</strong>, professor emeritus of English &amp; Comparative Literature, <strong>E.G. Crichton</strong>, professor emeritus of art, and <strong>Catherine Cooper</strong>, professor emeritus of psychology, were each awarded Edward A. Dickson Emeriti Professorships in recognition of their outstanding achievements in scholarship and teaching.</p>
<p>The awards are given annually and funded by an endowment from the estate of former UC Regent Edward A. Dickson. The professorships make it possible for the university to retain the invaluable services of highly accomplished, retired faculty members for the benefit of its students.</p>
<p>Baumgarten is a co-founding director of both the Jewish Studies Program and the Dickens Project at UC Santa Cruz. Recently, he has been working on the afterlife of the Venice Ghetto, and he is also a founder of the Venice Center for International Jewish Studies.</p>
<p>The Dickson emeriti award will help him complete research on Primo Levi&#8217;s <em>The Periodic Table</em>, which Baumgarten has described as &#8220;one of the great achievements of modern literature, and an indispensable document in the modern history of the Nazi concentration camp&#8212;part of a literary history of the Ghetto on which I have been working for a decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crichton uses a range of art strategies and media to explore social issues, history, and site-specific subject matter. Her work has been exhibited in art institutions and as public installations in Europe, Asia, Australia and across the U.S. She will use the Dickson award to support her research project, <em>OUT/LOOK and the Birth of the Queer<strong>,</strong></em> that will launch in October and include a multi-media exhibition at the GLBT History Museum in San Francisco.</p>
<p>A co-founder, art director, and editor for <em>OUT/LOOK National Lesbian and Gay Quarterly</em>, Crichton is collaborating with the GLBT Historical Society (GLBTHS) in San Francisco where the journal records are archived. She describes her role in the project as &#8220;initiator, creative director, curator and artist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cooper's work focuses on how youth forge their personal identities by coordinating cultural and family traditions with those of their schools, communities, and work. Over the past three decades, she has developed the Bridging Multiple Worlds Theory and conducted empirical studies to trace how culturally diverse youth create their pathways to college, careers, and cultural identities without losing ties to their families and cultural communities.</p>
<p>The Dickson award will help her to develop and distribute a new edition of the Bridging Multiple Worlds Toolkit--a resource designed to link researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to increase pathways to college and careers among students from low-income, ethnic minority, and immigrant families in multicultural societies.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fe2222a8072701721a2b70eb55eda7c"><name>bullying-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bullying in the workplace</title><summary>Abusive conduct and bullying in the workplace are completely unacceptable, and I am pleased to share that University of California President Janet Napolitano has issued guidelines regarding UC expectations. </summary><start-date>1491577200000</start-date><display-name>Workplace</display-name><path>/2017/04/bullying-message</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/bullying-message</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1491425434854</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1491600402793</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Work is a big part of our lives, and it can be difficult enough without having to cope with challenging behavior from colleagues or associates. Abusive conduct and bullying in the workplace are completely unacceptable, and I am pleased to share that University of California President Janet Napolitano has issued <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/abusive-conduct-and-bullying-in-the-workplace/Presidential_Guidance_Regarding_Staff_Abusive_Conduct_and_Bullying.pdf">guidelines</a> regarding UC expectations.</p>
<p>Status often plays a role in these dynamics, but no one is immune: Abusive conduct can be an issue among faculty, staff, and student employees.</p>
<p>Everyone is entitled to work in an atmosphere free from bullying and abuse.</p>
<p>If you feel you are the target of workplace bullying or abusive conduct, please contact one of the following individuals:</p>
<p>For staff: Jennifer Schiffner at (831) 459&#8211;1930 or jschiffn@ucsc.edu For academic employees: Susan Fellows at (831) 459&#8211;5032 or sfellows@ucsc.edu For student employees: Barbara Silverthorne at (831) 459&#8211;4590 or bsilver@ucsc.edu For everyone: Nancy Heischman at (831) 459&#8211;2290 or nheischm@ucsc.edu</p>
<p>In addition, UC Santa Cruz has compiled online resources, including a <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/abusive-conduct-and-bullying-in-the-workplace/index.html">website</a> with information on identifying workplace bullying, as well as procedures and resources for employees affected by bullying at work.</p>
<p>Staff Human Resources offers training in how to respond to bullying&#8212;for managers and supervisors, as well as those who are experiencing abusive conduct; details are available in the &#8220;Interpersonal Workplace Skills&#8221; section of the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/training/course_listings/prof-development.html#workplace-skills">Training and Development website</a>.</p>
<p>Additional information and resources are available on the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://ombuds.ucsc.edu">Problem and Complaint Resolution website</a>.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage all managers and supervisors to review the workplace bullying website and to attend the workplace bullying training for managers and supervisors.</p>
<p>Bullying damages morale and erodes productivity. If you have concerns, please reach out for support. It will benefit the entire campus community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fe416cb8072701721a2b70e8dffc4d8"><name>uc-santa-cruz-alumni-weekend-fun-run-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni to run for fun—and a good cause</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz’s famous forests and meadows will be the venue for this beautiful and challenging 5K stomp across the campus in support of student scholarships on April 29.</summary><start-date>1491425340000</start-date><display-name>Fun Run advance UC Santa Cruz Alumni Weekend</display-name><path>/2017/04/uc-santa-cruz-alumni-weekend-fun-run-advance</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/uc-santa-cruz-alumni-weekend-fun-run-advance</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1491425562909</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1491425601313</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/fun-run-photo-illustration.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/fun-run-photo-illustration.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fun-run-photo-illustration.jpg</name><display-name>fun-run-photo-illustration.jpg</display-name><file-size>29700</file-size><width>469</width><height>242</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/fun-run-photo-thumbnail-version</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/fun-run-photo-thumbnail-version</link><site>news</site><name>fun-run-photo-thumbnail-version</name><display-name>fun-run-photo-thumbnail-version</display-name><file-size>13352</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The Fun Run course offers unforgettable views and many lovely places to pause for a rest break.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>First-ever 5K Fun Run at Alumni Weekend to support student scholarships</article-subhead><article-text><p>Just how fast can a Banana Slug really go? &#160;</p>
<p>Find out for yourself at the first-ever <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/campus-fun-run-with-opers-and-financial-aid/">Alumni Weekend &#8220;Fun Run,&#8221;</a> which kicks off on Saturday, April 29, at 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s famous forests and meadows will be the venue for this beautiful and challenging 5K stomp across the campus in support of student scholarships. What better way to simultaneously help students as well as earn those yummy picnic items and craft brews at the <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ur-artisinal-carry-out-lunch/">Artisanal Carry-Out Lunch</a> and <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/vintner-brewer-reception/">Alumni Brewer and Vintner Reception</a> later? &#160;</p>
<p>The run is a joint organizational effort involving UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports (OPERS) as well as the campus Financial Aid Office.</p>
<p>The scenic race will take place on a loop course that is shaped, vaguely, like a giant and rather lumpy banana slug. Runners are likely to see a few deer along the way. They might even see an actual banana slug or two, hiding out in the forest.</p>
<p>Runners will jog, stop, sprint, and saunter past all colleges on the heavily wooded 2,000-acre campus and will huff and puff alongside many major nostalgic and picturesque spots.</p>
<p>Clint Angus, interim competitive sports and youth camp supervisor at UC Santa Cruz, talked about the spirit of cooperation that led to this informal race. &#8220;We thought this would be a good opportunity (for OPERs and the Financial Aid Office) to work together, so Intramural Sports volunteered in helping to organize a race course, track the participants' times, and provide staff,&#8221; Angus said.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that the event is open to alumni as well as UC Santa Cruz students who take part in intramural sports. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of those occasions where our alums and current students can participate in the same event.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, by the way, if you think the 5K sounds a bit too intense, you may also opt for a 3K route that is family friendly.</p>
<p>Lockers will be available for all runners&#8212;though remember to bring your own lock&#8212;and, not to fear, there will be water and photo stations, shuttle service, and refreshments at OPERS.</p>
<p>This event is also open to the Santa Cruz community. &#160;<a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2409&amp;cid=4385">Registration is required</a> for this event; if advance interest is any indication, the Fun Run will be popular, so participants should sign up early to guarantee a spot. Race fees are&#160; $90 for a family or group of four, $50 for a family or group of two, $30 for individual alumni racers, and $15 for students (ID required at check-in).</p>

protesters staged the country&#8217;s first Take Back the Night marches, students at UC Santa Cruz and other colleges nationwide have expanded the single night of protest to fill the entire month of April with events aimed at raising awareness about sexual violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s important about this month and this year, at this school particularly, is that we need to be empowered,&#8221; said Morgan Bostic, a student organizer at the <a href="http://womenscenter.ucsc.edu/">Women&#8217;s Center</a>. &#8220;The university needs to be taking an active role in empowering students to become educated about sexual assaults on their campus and become aware of the methods of changing institutional structures and how to advocate on their behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the events for Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), hosted by several campus offices, include nationally acclaimed speakers, yoga and art workshops, <a href="http://titleix.ucsc.edu/">Title IX Office</a> open houses, a community town hall meeting and ongoing discussions about sexual violence issues on campus&#8212;in addition to a march and rally at the end of the month. The greater community is invited to participate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events are really focused on supporting survivors and healing, on education, activism and speaking out,&#8221; Bostic said. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to have an activist&#8217;s trifecta&#8212;giving the students all the resources they need to stand up against sexual assault on their campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The busy calendar includes a discussion about consent on Monday, April 10; a painting class on Tuesday, April 11; a workshop on violence in the queer community on Wednesday, April 12; and a community town hall meeting to discuss sexual violence and sexual harassment policy on campus on Thursday, April 13, the latest in a series of ongoing discussions stemming from the campus Beyond Compliance initiative. The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2017/04/beyond-compliance.html">town hall</a> is 6&#8211;8 p.m. in the Oakes College Learning Center.</p>
<p>In the following weeks, there are workshops on yoga, art and how allies can support survivors, as well as three Title IX Office open houses to be April 18, 19 and 21. The last one is specifically geared to UCSC employees.</p>
<p>Three student-initiated events, sponsored by the Women&#8217;s Center, include a <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4234">Take Back The Night</a> march and rally at 5:30 p.m. on April 26, followed by a <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4235">Survivor Speak Out</a> with keynote speaker Amita Swadhin, a nationally known activist and survivor.</p>
<p>April 26 is also Denim Day, a way to show solidarity with survivors and emphasize that what you wear has nothing to do with consenting to violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way to dismantle some of those harmful myths about rape that persist in the culture,&#8221; said Emily Crutcher, director of <a href="http://care.ucsc.edu/">Campus Advocacy, Resources Education</a> (CARE), which is hosting most of the workshops for the month.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are really eager to get more involved in some of the policy changes that are happening and are asking, &#8216;what does that look like for our campus?&#8217;&#8221; Crutcher said.</p>
<p>Swadhin is also holding a Secret Survivors Workshop on Thursday, April 27, and on Friday, April 28, Mahroh Jahangiri, director of student and survivor-run organization, Know Your IX, will hold a workshop.</p>
<p>Students made the decisions about everything that is hosted by the Women&#8217;s Center, said Rebecca Hernandez Rosser, interim director of the Women&#8217;s Center and director of the American Indian Resource Center. &#8220;They felt, given the campus climate at the time, and really in the nation, that is was important to bring somebody who could speak to their concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosser encourages people to come out not just to hear the speakers but also to engage with students and hear new perspectives from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events provide opportunities for the community to get a fresh look at what some of these activists are doing and how they&#8217;re addressing things,&#8221; Rosser said. &#160; Although one month is not enough, it boosts the topic in the campus profile, Crutcher said</p>
<p>&#8220;The point is to ignite new conversations and initiatives that will change the campus culture,&#8221; Crutcher said. &#8220;We&#8217;re having several exciting events this month, but really, what will sustain the movement is getting students, faculty and staff invested in continuing this work throughout the year.&#8221; CARE, she notes, offers a quarterly five-hour, peer educator CARE training for student volunteers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The month&#8217;s activities are also one way to remind people that they have several options if they experience personally or are aware of some incidents of sexual violence,&#8221; said Laura Young-Hinck, Title IX Office response team coordinator. Some people may choose to pursue a formal investigation, others might want to get confidential support and other might just want to learn about the process to help someone else.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important that people know what resources and options they have to make sure they do what&#8217;s right for them,&#8221; Young-Hinck said. &#8220;If someone makes a report, they will still have control about whether or not they want to continue.&#8221; In addition to stopping by the office to ask questions, Young-Hinck invites people to see the new <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ucsc-resources-options.pdf">Resources and Reporting Options handout</a>. People can print them or <a href="mailto:lyounghi@ucsc.edu">request printed brochures</a> to display on resource tables.</p>
<p>The Title IX office has seen a significant increase in the number of reports over the past three years, but those numbers still represent only a small percentage of the sexual assault and sexual misconduct that is actually happening.</p>
<p>Young-Hinck encourages people to come forward and make reports even if they are not sure about what options they want to pursue or if they are not sure an incident constitutes sexual harassment or sexual violence. The Title IX staff can help clarify incidents and options. Reporting also helps the staff recognize and address patterns of behavior that occur over time. If other people are talking about an incident, people shouldn&#8217;t assume that a report of the incident has reached the Title IX office; we need to know about incidents in order to work with campus partners to take action.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a whole community to create that change,&#8221; she said. &#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://womenscenter.ucsc.edu/resources/dv.html</url><title>Women’s Center Online Resource Guid</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://titleix.ucsc.edu</url><title>Title IX Office</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://care.ucsc.edu</url><title>Campus Advocacy Resources and Education </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4471edcd8072701721a2b70e21087ba5"><name>beyond-compliance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Beyond Compliance town hall on April 13</title><summary>The event will provide the campus community with information on federal and state laws around personnel cases and privacy rights, proposed and completed reforms to campus policy, insight on Title IX investigations, and our shared responsibility to work toward building a safer community.

<p>The second Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Beyond Compliance event of the 2016&#8211;17 academic year will take place on Thursday, April 13 at the Oakes College Learning Center from 6&#8211;8 p.m. Interim CP/EVC Herbert Lee and representatives from Title IX, Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE), Dean of Students Office, Staff Human Resources, and the Academic Senate will attend.</p>
<p>The event will provide the campus community with information on federal and state laws around personnel cases and privacy rights, proposed and completed reforms to campus policy, insight on Title IX investigations, and our shared responsibility to work toward building a safer community. Half of the evening will be devoted to hearing from attendees.</p>
<p>Nancy Heischman, Director of Campus Conflict Resolution Services, will facilitate a comment, question, and answer session. In light of the many conversations taking place on campus regarding sexual violence and sexual harassment, we want to give community members an opportunity to express concerns, ask questions, offer suggestions, and take a role in improving our campus. We welcome your feedback on our policies and climate and hope you will share any ideas you have for making the campus a safer place.</p>
<p>To ensure that we address the issues that the campus community finds most pressing, we will also take questions left anonymously on the event webpage:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/99x1oYfVtCHRbtq93">https://goo.gl/forms/99x1oYfVtCHRbtq93</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll answer as many in-person and online questions as possible on April 13 and hope to post our responses online for those unable to attend. Please bear in mind that we are unable to address specific cases.</p>
<p>We believe that the administration and the campus community have an intertwined obligation to work together toward an environment in which everyone is safe and treated with respect, and we ask your help in building that future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Kimberly Lau, Professor, Literature;

<p>Titled <em>What is Lost When A Species Goes Extinct? A Colloquium on the Unspeakable Value of Life</em>, it will be a conversation about the impact of language&#8212;how particular words and concepts impact the public&#8217;s thinking about topics such as &#8220;sustainability,&#8221; &#8220;conservation,&#8221; and &#8220;extinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Language of Conservation is an interdisciplinary research group that seeks to change the way we talk and think about the value of life in all of its diverse forms.</p>
<p>It was launched by program directors Daniel Guevara (chair of the Philosophy Department) and Claudio Campagna (adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology), who believe that the language used by the conservation movement over the past three decades has unintentionally undermined efforts to promote biodiversity--because it reinforces the politically self-serving language of &#8220;sustainable development.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two professors argue that we have been using the language of economics applied to nature, but that is a language incapable of grasping the value of life&#8212;except for its value to human development. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The language of conservation today--including&#160;iconic terms like &#8216;sustainable development&#8217; and emerging terms&#160;like&#160;&#8216;de-extinction&#8217;--is an example of what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein called a &#8216;bewitchment of our intelligence by means of our language,&#8221; noted Guevara. &#8220;We must identify and battle the confusion this language gives rise to, before we can give authentic expression to the value of nature, and especially to the value of life in all its great diversity of forms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the great conservationist Aldo Leopold noted long ago: when it comes to nature, we are at the frontier of &#8216;values as yet uncaptured by language,&#8217; he added.</p>
<p>Both Guevara and Campagna have a great appreciation for the wide variety of ways in which our language and terminology can limit, shape, and often distort our thinking. Campagna has been involved in conservation action for three decades, and Guevara has taught ethics for many years, including environmental ethics.</p>
<p>They will be joined at the April 14 event by Beth Shapiro, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology; and Paul Koch, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>This event is sponsored by the Institute for Humanities Research and the Center for Public Philosophy at UC Santa Cruz. It will run from 2 p.m. to 5:30 pm at Humanities 1, Room 210. Admission is free and open to the public.

<p>Finding a fawn (baby deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the <strong>campus police department 459-2231</strong> or <strong>county Animal Control: <a href="tel:831-454-7227">831-454-7227</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>

We found the letter informative and worth sharing.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,<br/>
 I write to remind you of the Responsible Employee obligation set forth in the <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SVSH">UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with the policy, any UC employee who is not specifically identified as a Confidential Resource is a Responsible Employee required to report sexual violence, sexual harassment or other conduct prohibited by the policy.</p>
<p>All employees, including nonsupervisory employees and student employees, must inform the Title IX officer when, in the course of their work, they become aware that a student has experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence (including sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking).</p>
<p>Faculty, managers and supervisors, human resources administrators, and academic personnel have a broader obligation, and must inform the Title IX officer when they get a report of sexual harassment or sexual violence from a colleague, a subordinate, or anyone else affiliated with the university.</p>
<p>A Responsible Employee fulfills their obligation by contacting their campus Title IX officer or designee and providing whatever information they have about the incident, including the names and contact information of any individuals involved. The Responsible Employee should not conduct any investigation or take steps to resolve the incident on their own. The policy prohibits retaliation against Responsible Employees and anyone else who reports sexual harassment or sexual violence to the Title IX office.</p>
<p>A Responsible Employee&#8217;s report ensures that UC community members who have experienced sexual violence or sexual harassment understand their rights and resources. It also enables the University to take prompt and effective steps to stop the harassment or violence, and foster a safe learning and working environment. An employee who does not comply with the Responsible Employee requirement may be subject to consequences for failing to report, which may include corrective actions, up to and including termination.</p>
<p>The Office of the President has recently issued <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu/sexual-violence-sexual-assault-faqs/responsible-employees-faqs-2/">FAQs</a> regarding the Responsible Employee obligation. I encourage you to share this message, and the FAQs, broadly with your campus or location community.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>You may have noticed this week that your connection to eduroam wireless service has intermittently been disrupted. Thank you to those people who reported the problems!</p>
<p>ITS has identified two separate issues and will be fixing one of the issues this afternoon, April 7 from 4:00PM - 4:30PM. During this time, eduroam will be unavailable for approximately 15 minutes.</p>
<p>During this maintenance window, you may choose to use CruzNet for basic wireless connectivity. After the work is complete, you may reconnect to eduroam. If you are unable to automatically reconnect to eduroam, please turn your wireless off and then back on, or you may reset your device.</p>
<p>If you have questions or encounter issues, please submit an IT Request ticket at <a href="https://itrequest.ucsc.edu/">https://itrequest.ucsc.edu</a> or contact the ITS Support Center by email <a href="mailto:help@ucsc.edu">help@ucsc.edu</a>, telephone 459-HELP(4357), or in-person Kerr Hall Room 54.</p>

<p>Those hidden stories will be raised to the surface when <a href="http://merrill.ucsc.edu/programs/dear-worlducsc.html">Dear World</a>, an award-winning, international storytelling project, comes to campus, starting on Thursday, April 13 and continuing through Friday, April 14.</p>
<p>Dear World has been described as &#8220;part business/art project/social experiment exploring stories of hope, stories of struggle, stories of a brighter day.&#8221; The program starts with a simple question: &#8220;If you had one story to share with the world, what would you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear World envisions all the shared stories as part of a vast and colorful mosaic that makes up the campus community.</p>
<p>The Dear World events kick off on campus with a &#8220;VIP Photo Shoot&#8221; that will take place at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, April 13, at the Bhojwani Dining Room (Terra Fresca) at University Center. Those who wish to join students, staff, and faculty at this special event may do so, but first, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSftXTYQjF0WyhG1lNFf-vx05n14qwOEJxeuxbeke2p5LvtBxg/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">make sure to fill out this registration form.</a></p>
<p>The main photo shoot will take place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday, April 14.</p>
<p>Then Dear World will continue with a major storytelling event, to be held that Friday evening at 8 p.m., at the Multipurpose Room for Colleges 9 and 10. Many of the portraits taken over the previous two days will be unveiled at the event. Dessert and tea will be served. All are welcome.</p>
<p>This program is put on for and by the UC Santa Cruz community. Dear World brings two staff to facilitate the events and take photos. Campus organizers are now recruiting about 32 volunteers from the UC Santa Cruz community to facilitate the events. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeErRqePkOtaXKS8X6xlyxwZiEXfXs8IXP7JsQMs2vnjnxXFg/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">Those who wish to help out should fill out this form.</a></p>
<p>The rationale behind the project is simple and straightforward. &#8220;Storytelling is a powerful way for people to come together and share their identities in a unique way, offering a sense of shared humanity,&#8221; said Cowell College programs coordinator Kara Snider, who heads the planning committee for Dear World/Dear UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UC Santa Cruz Principles of Community articulate a desire to 'celebrate the heritage, achievements, and diversity of the community and the uniqueness and contributions of our members,'" Snider continued. &#8220;We believe that our nation and campus are at a point where it is more important than ever to form connections with each other. In bringing the program to UC Santa Cruz, we hope community members will find deeper connections, clarify and strengthen their personal identities, learn to describe their own values, and develop an understanding of the intersectionality of identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear World consists of two separate entities&#8212;a for-profit venture that generates revenue and a 501(c)(3)&#160;organization. Organizations that partner with Dear World pay a fee for photo shoots.</p>
<p>The Dear World/Dear UC Santa Cruz project has its origins at Cowell College.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Cowell, we began conversations with new provost Alan Christy last spring to do a year-long co-curricular storytelling program series,&#8221; Snider said.</p>
<p>Starting in the fall, all new Cowell students were invited to the provost house to craft stories and characters.</p>
<p>Then in winter, Cowell hosted some storytelling workshops and a Story Slam facilitated by UC Santa Cruz alumnus Simon Hanukai, a director and curator.</p>
<p>&#8220;For spring we wanted to do something beyond Cowell for the entire campus,&#8221; Snider said. &#8220;At the end of fall quarter, I put the call out for collaborators and formed the committee. We have fundraised across campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear World/Dear UC Santa Cruz is made possible by support from Colleges, Housing &amp; Educational Services, Cowell College, Merrill College, Stevenson Programs, Crown College, Kresge Programs, Rachel Carson College, Oakes College, the Bay Tree Bookstore, the Disability Resource Center, Cowell Student Senate, Stevenson Student Council, Rachel Carson Student Council, and the Oakes Student Senate.</p>
<p>Several other universities and colleges have put on Dear World storytelling events. Next week, UC San Diego is hosting its own series of Dear World photo shoots and storytelling sessions.</p>

<p>Living in a working-class Southern California neighborhood with immigrant parents, she had no high-tech mentors to help her out, just loads of self-determination, curiosity, and creativity.</p>
<p>Since then, De Guzman, a self-taught coding whiz, has become a champion and a mentor for girls considering high-tech careers. This month, De Guzman will have a prestigious venue to share her words of wisdom about closing the Silicon Valley gender gap. She will appear at the upcoming TEDxLosGatosHighSchool, which will be held from 1 to 5 p.m. on April 15 at Los Gatos High School.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tedxlghs.com/2017">Advance tickets are available through the website</a>.</p>
<p>In her presentation, De Guzman will make a strong appeal to parents who would like to help their girls achieve high-tech success.</p>
<p>"Parents send their girls to coding camps or buy them programming books to support their pursuits, but to sustain their interest, parents need to teach their daughters how to code," De Guzman said. "It may be challenging, especially if the parent does not know how to code, but the learning experience will be much more meaningful. Like teaching your kids how to ride a bike or tie their shoes, parents need to be there for every technical hurdle and success they come across."</p>
<p>De Guzman is seizing upon a timely issue in her upcoming talk. The <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> recently ran a hair-raising cover story entitled &#8220;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/">Why is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?,&#8221;</a> describing pervasive and &#8220;pernicious&#8221; sexism in the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of female role models</strong></p>
<p>Strong mentors are important in the face of such lopsided demographics, said Katherine Isbister, UC Santa Cruz professor of computational media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though our society at large and leaders and visionaries in the computational profession clearly value having a more diverse community of coders in research and in industry, we continue to struggle with achieving this,&#8221; Isbister said. &#8220;The research shows that having female role models helps&#8212;it's a vital piece of the puzzle of continuing to make change.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Guzman has seen the skewed gender demographics firsthand.</p>
<p>When applying for job interviews in tech, she would often notice &#8220;five guys and just me&#8221; sitting around in the waiting area. &#8220;"It's intimidating to see the gender inequality right before an interview,&#8221; she said. &#8220;About 18 percent of women are majoring in computer science&#8212;even less in computer engineering. Even in my classes, it is clear that this statistic holds true."</p>
<p>As part of her long-term plan to change these demographics, De Guzman volunteers as the lead instructor for the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of Girls Who Code, the influential tech organization founded by American lawyer and politician Reshma Saujani. In a quote on the Girls Who Code website, Saujani said that she started the organization to reach out to girls who wanted use tech as an agent of change in their communities, &#8220;whether it&#8217;s a game to illustrate the experience of an undocumented immigrant or a website to provide free college prep.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Guzman teaches software and hardware development at West Valley Branch Library in San Jose. She and her young charges are hard at work on an interactive emergency bracelet for girls; though it looks like a fashion accessory, it can call out for help in dangerous situations.</p>
<p>De Guzman said she would have felt a lot more secure during her own childhood in Long Beach if she'd had one of these bracelets. &#8220;I did not grow up in the most privileged circumstances,&#8221; she said. Sometimes, walking through a sketchy neighborhood at night, she wondered if she was going to make it home safely.</p>
<p><strong>Diving into code</strong></p>
<p>Her father, a commercial fisherman, and her mother, a food service manager, both come from the Philippines. They graduated from high school but could not scrape up enough money to attend college. Though money was tight, they worked hard to ensure a better future for their three children.</p>
<p>At first De Guzman wanted to be a doctor. &#8220;I wanted to go university to study biology,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I enjoyed helping people and I loved science and problem solving.&#8221; But when De Guzman was still in kindergarten, her mother pooled together enough money to buy her a Compaq desktop computer from Walmart. De Guzman dove right in. Soon she was helping her parents send messages back and forth to relatives overseas.</p>
<p>By age 12, she was designing sophisticated websites and interest pages, focusing on the marine sciences and ocean photography. &#8220;It was just something to do after school, and my first experience of learning how to code,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize, at first, that I was using HTML and CSS.&#8221; Both are computer languages that are commonly used in front-end web development.</p>
<p><br/>
 These days, she sees that same spark in the girls who take her classes. &#8220;Due to societal factors, girls in computing endure a lot of pressure from both the work environment and their colleagues,&#8221; De Guzman said. &#8220;It is getting better, but we still have a huge deficit to fix. I want them to understand that young women are capable of breaking into the fragmented tech industry, and they don&#8217;t have to do it alone.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5999e0d18072701721a2b70e2e39f0fb"><name>ehs-facility</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Construction set for new Environmental Health and Safety facility</title><summary>The nearly $20 million Environmental Health and Safety Facility, funded by the state through the UC Office of the President, will help ensure the campus continues to comply with state and federal regulations. </summary><keywords>research, environmental health and safety, </keywords><start-date>1491840000000</start-date><display-name>Research</display-name><path>/2017/04/ehs-facility</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/ehs-facility</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1491856907121</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1492793650798</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/04/images/waste-facility-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/04/images/waste-facility-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>waste-facility-500px.jpg</name><display-name>waste-facility-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>65166</file-size><width>500</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Construction on&#160;the Enivornmental Health and Safety Building will begin later this year.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is set to start construction this summer on a building to process and temporarily hold waste generated by teaching, research, and campus maintenance activities.</p>
<p>The nearly $20 million Environmental Health and Safety Facility, funded by the state through the UC Office of the President, will help ensure the campus continues to comply with state and federal regulations. The 5,200-square-foot building will be built adjacent to Heller Road, just south of the Kerr Hall pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p>Construction on the facility is expected to start in the second half of 2017 and end in December 2018. As with all campus buildings, architects have designed the facility to blend in with the natural landscape and carefully site the building around groves of trees as to minimize the number of trees removed for the building and accompanying driveways.</p>
<p>Currently, lab waste is directed to two different interim facilities, one on Science Hill and one at the base of campus. This project will consolidate the management into one site. Patrick Goff, executive director of Environmental Health &amp; Safety and the Office of Emergency Services, said all other UC campuses, except Merced, have built similar facilities.</p>
<p>The facility will be used to manage chemical waste and low-level radioactive waste.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has instructors and researchers in the life sciences, physical sciences, and fine arts who use chemicals in their work and generate waste that needs processing and disposal. In addition, chemicals are used to help maintain the campus. Chemical waste is packaged and labeled by trained researchers and staff, and is collected once a week to bring it to the holding facility. Within 90 days, a licensed contractor transports the chemical waste to an approved and permitted treatment, storage, and disposal facility.</p>
<p>Additionally, some researchers in the life sciences and physical sciences use low-level radioactive materials to carry out experiments and educate students on certain techniques. The campus annually receives less than 100 milliliters&#8212;or less than 3 ounces&#8212;of radioactive material for research.</p>
<p>Natural radiation is all around us. For example, living in Santa Cruz exposes a person to about 647 millirem of radiation every year. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, can expose a person to much more. A pack a day adds up to about 25,000 millirem in a year.</p>
<p>UCSC's radiation workers, including researchers and staff handling radioactive waste, typically receive doses below 10 mrem per year from their work.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="59ada9258072701721a2b70e8d0f6549"><name>guthman-guggenheim</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Social Sciences Professor Julie Guthman wins 2017 Guggenheim Fellowship</title><summary>Julie Guthman, a professor of social sciences and a leading scholar on the history and geography of California agriculture, has been awarded a 2017 Guggenheim Fellowship.</summary><keywords>guthman, guggenheim, farming, agriculture, organic, sustainable, social sciences, fellowship</keywords><start-date>1491807600000</start-date><display-name>Guthman-Guggenheim</display-name><path>/2017/04/guthman-guggenheim</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/guthman-guggenheim</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1491858203598</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1492137193408</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/guthman-julie-460.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/guthman-julie-460.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-julie-460.jpg</name><file-size>121021</file-size><width>460</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Julie Guthman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/guthman-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/guthman-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-thumb.jpg</name><file-size>6749</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Julie Guthman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Guggenheim Fellowship will allow Julie Guthman to focus on writing a book about a soil pathogen that has shaped the evolution of commercial strawberry production in California.

<p>Guthman is one of 173 scholars, artists, and scientists recognized by the <a href="http://www.gf.org/">John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation</a>, selected from among nearly 3,000 applications. Guggenheim Fellows are selected on the basis of past achievement and the promise of future accomplishment.</p>
<p>Guthman, a UCSC alumna (B.A., sociology, 1979) who joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2003, is well known for her research on sustainable agriculture and alternative food movements. A proponent of organic agriculture, she nevertheless brings a keen and critical eye to the political-economy of sustainable food production.</p>
<p>Guthman's first book, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/11/595.html"><em>Agrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in California</em></a>, published in 2004, was the first comprehensive study of organic agriculture in California. A second edition, published in 2014, revisited the subject in light of widespread consumer acceptance of organic food, and the political and market forces that shape the industry, including organic regulation and certification.</p>
<p>Guthman's second book, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/10/guthman-weighing-in.html"><em>Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice, and the Limits of Capitalism</em></a>, challenged many widely held assumptions about the "obesity epidemic." Her forthcoming book, co-edited with Alison Alkon, is The New Food Activism: Opposition, Cooperation, and Collective Action; it is due out in late 2017. She is also the author of more than 40 articles in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>Each 2017 Guggenheim Fellow receives approximately $50,000 to support in-depth work on a project. Guthman will focus on a book project about a soil pathogen, Verticillium dahliae, that has bedeviled strawberry growers and shaped the evolution of commercial strawberry production.</p>
<p>Scholars at UC Santa Cruz have received more than 50 Guggenheim Fellowships since the campus opened in 1965. The Guggenheim Foundation has granted more than $350 million in fellowships to 18,000 people since its establishment in 1925.</p>
<p>"These artists and writers, scholars and scientists, represent the best of the best," said Edward Hirsch, president of the Guggenheim Foundation. "It's an honor to be able to support these individuals to do the work they were meant to do."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5eda5ebf8072701721a2b70e61d52407"><name>lick-summer-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lick Observatory's summer series brings a wide variety of musicians and scientists to Mt.

<p class="normal">&#65279;<strong>Mount Hamilton</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Quimby Road (lower Mount Hamilton Road CA-130 is currently closed due to a washout). Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO), a multi-campus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. More information is available online at <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/">www.ucolick.org</a>.</p>

<p>He was honored in the category of best featured actor for his role this past summer in George Bernard Shaw&#8217;s comedy, <em>You Never Can Tell,</em> at California Shakespeare Theater.</p>
<p>Scheie has previously won Bay Area Critics Circle awards as leading actor for <em>The Last Hairdresser</em> at Theater Rhinoceros in 1997, <em>You Nero</em> at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2010, and <em>Last Fall</em> at San Jose Repertory Theatre in 2013.&#160;</p>
<p>Scheie has also won as best supporting actor for a world premiere Lanford Wilson piece at the Magic Theater in 1996, and as director for <em>Comedy of Errors</em> at Aurora Theater in 1999.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Critics Circle, like those in New York for stage and film, is made up of many theater critics who vote on the award, and has been the major longstanding award for theater in our area,&#8221; Scheie noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently, another award, the Theater Bay Area awards--which has a jury more like that of the Tonys in New York (a mix of critics, artists, and producers)--was initiated, for which I won the inaugural leading actor award as Dromio in Shakespeare's <em>Comedy of Errors</em> at California Shakespeare Theater,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Scheie&#8217;s upcoming projects include the leading role in Amy Freed's Pulitzer-nominated <em>The Monster Builder</em> at South Coast Repertory, and next year in the world premiere of Freed&#8217;s <em>Shrew!</em> at the same theater.&#160;</p>
<p>This summer he will also perform in Peter Sinn Nachtrieb's play <em>The Making of A Great Moment</em> at Z Space in Theater Artaud in San Francisco, and in fall Scheie will appear in a new play by Daniel Handler (<em>Lemony Snicke</em>t) at Berkeley Rep.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="602e78068072701721a2b70e5c305f94"><name>outstanding-staff-nominations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nominations for UC Santa Cruz's Outstanding Staff Award</title><summary>This is a reminder that the deadline for Outstanding Staff Award nomination submissions is Friday, April 17, 2017. </summary><start-date>1491807600000</start-date><display-name>Nominations for UC Santa Cruz's Outstanding Staff Award</display-name><path>/2017/04/outstanding-staff-nominations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/outstanding-staff-nominations</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1491967308284</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1492458805983</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This is a reminder that the deadline for Outstanding Staff Award nomination submissions is Monday, April 17, 2017.</p>

<p>Alumni are in for a truly immersive experience, whether they are dashing past their old dorms during the first-ever 5K Fun Run, sipping craft brews at the beautifully renovated Hay Barn near the base of campus, or listening to an off-campus keynote speech by Carmen Perez, a national co-chair of the Women&#8217;s March on Washington.</p>
<p>This year, the focus is on expanding your mind while spotlighting diversity, showcasing students, and highlighting the best of UC Santa Cruz, said Danielle Solick, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s assistant director of alumni engagement, reunions, and council support.</p>
<p>&#8220;We talked a lot about fun and exciting ways to refresh the feel of the weekend while honoring who we are, and we accomplished that,&#8221; Solick said. &#8220;We have a really fun, vibrant, energetic weekend planned that stays true to our reputation for cutting-edge, rigorous intellectual opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s Alumni Weekend will be a living memorial to Santa Cruz artist <a href="https://squareup.com/market/dougrossfineart">Doug Ross</a>, who created the fanciful artwork for this year&#8217;s festival. Ross, known for his luminous portrayals of Santa Cruz&#8217;s beauty and wildlife, passed away this winter.</p>
<p><strong>Friday: good times, serious message</strong></p>
<p>The festivities begin on campus on Friday, April 28, with a full roster of engaging activities, including the annual <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/digital-arts-and-new-media-mfa-exhibition/">Digital Arts and New Media MFA Exhibition</a> showing cutting-edge and highly innovative student works, a chance to see a <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ucsc-greenhouse-tour/">one-of-a-kind rooftop greenhouse facility</a> complete with a waterfall, and an opportunity to dive deep beneath the sea without a wetsuit at the crafty and lovely <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/crochet-coral-reef-exhibition-tour-with-the-curators/">Crochet Coral Reef exhibition</a>&#8212;a re-creation of an underwater landscape rendered in yarn at the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery.</p>
<p>Celebrants will also have a chance to honor a social justice hero, Kris Perry (Merrill, &#8217;86, psychology and sociology), who will receive the Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award at a ceremony that will take place at 4 p.m. at the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a>, which is <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/directions/">located on 100 McAllister Way in Santa Cruz</a> -- a quick and scenic drive away from the main campus. Perry and her partner, Sandy Stier, became well known after challenging Proposition 8, California&#8217;s controversial ban against same-sex marriage, in a lawsuit described as &#8220;putting fear and prejudice on trial.&#8221; Those who wish to attend should make sure to <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2409&amp;cid=4385">RSVP</a> by April 16.</p>
<p>The official launch party for the weekend takes place a short jaunt away from campus&#8212;3.3 miles, to be precise&#8212;with the <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ur-block-party/">Alumni Weekend Kick-Off Party and Beer Garden</a> extravaganza at the Aloha Terrace in front of the legendary Cocoanut Grove at the Beach Boardwalk from 4:30&#8211;6:30 p.m, giving celebrants a chance to have some fun in the sun while gazing across Main Beach. The cost is $10 per person. This is bound to be popular, so make sure to <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2409&amp;cid=4385">register in advance.</a></p>
<p>And once you&#8217;re there at the Beach Party, you will be within easy walking distance of a true Alumni Weekend highlight&#8212;a chance to see your fellow Banana Slug <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ur-keynote-event/">Carmen Perez, national co-chair of the Women&#8217;s March on Washington</a>, which made international headlines and galvanized women from coast to coast. Perez has dedicated 20 years to advocating for many of today&#8217;s important civil rights issues. She will speak on her experiences driving unprecedented numbers of people into action in call campaigns, strikes, protests, and more. <a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2409&amp;cid=4385">Register now for this event</a>, keeping in mind that $35 covers just the keynote and $40 covers both the keynote and kick-off party.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday: get your running shoes on and celebrate the Slug!</strong></p>
<p>The second day of Alumni Weekend starts off not with a bang, and not with a whimper, but with an &#8220;On your marks, get set, go!&#8221; The first-ever Alumni Weekend <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/campus-fun-run-with-opers-and-financial-aid/">Fun Run,</a> in support of student scholarships, starts at 8:30 a.m., so cinch up those shoes, stretch those calves, and let the races begin.

<p>Slugs will have a chance to "get wild" with real live elephant seals in a completely sold-out tour of A&#241;o Nuevo State Park, or take part in a &#8220;<a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/younger-lagoon-reserve-bioblitz/">bioblitz&#8217;&#8217; for science</a> off campus, at the Younger Lagoon Reserve.

<p>All that running and cavorting with creatures is enough to make anyone work up a big appetite. Fortunately, returning Banana Slugs have a great option. From noon to 2 p.m., celebrants can join friends and family in a <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ur-artisinal-carry-out-lunch/">gourmet carry-out</a> lunch to enjoy at the tables in Quarry Plaza, in the family&#8211;friendly Kid Zone at Cowell&#8217;s upper lawn, or at one of several lunchtime gatherings.

<p>And what better way to bring this fabulous day to a close than with a stop at the <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/vintner-brewer-reception/">Alumni Vintner/Brewer Reception</a> at the lovingly refurbished Cowell Ranch Hay&#160; Barn starting at 4 p.m, and featuring alumni brew geniuses New Bohemia and Uncommon Brewers?</p>

<p>This is an update regarding the 2016/17 Pay for Performance Program. SHR and a cross-functional work team continue to work on changes designed to simplify and focus the program.</p>
<p>Just as a reminder, even as we build changes into our existing tools, processes and procedures, we want to remind everyone about a few basic best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managers, supervisors and their staff benefit from creating goals that support the university mission and are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound) or SIMple (specific, important, measurable).</li>
<li>Managers and supervisors demonstrate their engagement with staff by holding frequent 1:1 meetings with their team members to review progress and provide feedback and coaching as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Training is a key element of our overall effort and we have some new offerings scheduled soon.<br/>
&#8220;Focus on Performance&#8221; is a classroom training experience with two modules that will be offered to the campus (See <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/training/course_listings/prof-development.html#leadership-management-development" target="_blank">Training &amp; Development Course Listings</a>.) Training is also available upon request to your department/division. Please contact Bill Parro, <a href="mailto:wcparro@ucsc.edu">wcparro@ucsc.edu</a> <a href="tel:831-459-2861">831-459-2861</a></p>
<p>The &#8220;Focus on Performance&#8221; training modules are: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goal Setting and Feedback</span> (2 hours), and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performance Appraisal Training</span> (1 hour).</p>
<p>THE PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL TOOLS AND PROCESS</p>
<p>Our work team recently polled employees for feedback on the rating scale used. The results favored using a 5-point scale over a 3-point scale by a margin of 60% to 34%. After careful consideration of the results and numerous thoughtful comments, we have decided to retain the 5-point scale, but we have changed the definitions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 = Exceptional</li>
<li>4 = Consistently exceeded expectations</li>
<li>3 = Met expectations</li>
<li>2 = Improvement Needed</li>

But homesickness hit hard during her first quarter on campus. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I was really struggling. There were a lot of times I wanted to go home," recalled Gomez, whose neighbors were predominantly Mexican American and Central American. "My household speaks Spanish at home, and not hearing that here was hard. I had culture shock."<br/>
 <br/>
 All of that changed winter quarter, when Gomez discovered <a href="http://losmejicas.ucsc.edu/">Grupo Folklorico Los Mejicas</a>, a student-run dance troupe that celebrates the regional music, dances, and traditions of Mexico. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'd never done it before, but I wasn't the only one without dance experience," said Gomez. "At first I was so lost, but I stuck around and gave it a chance. It was more than dance. Everyone was willing to help me out. I saw I wasn't the only one who needed a home away from home."<br/>
 <br/>
 Today, Gomez, a second-year Porter College student, is one of 51 members of Los Mejicas. The troupe meets three days a week and performs regularly on campus and for elementary and high school students, festivals, and special events hosted by organizations like the Museum of Art and History in Santa Cruz County and beyond. Gomez coordinates the group's events and puts in an extra three hours or so of practice each week ("To grow as a dancer, you have to practice outside the class," she said). Students can earn two credits per quarter, or they can dance just for fun. <br/>
 <br/>
 Last fall, Gomez was happy to welcome new members. "I reassured them we're all here for each other," she said. "We all teach each other." One senior confided that she wished she had heard about Los Mejicas earlier.<br/>
 <br/>
 "Mejicas provides a safe space. It's like a second family," said Olga Najera-Ramirez, professor emeritus of anthropology, who has served as faculty advisor to Los Mejicas since 1996. A UCSC alumna (B.A. Latin American Studies and history, Merrill '77) who danced with the group as an undergraduate, Najera-Ramirez said Los Mejicas "inspired me to become an anthropologist."<br/>
 <br/>
 "The original idea wasn't to be a performance group, but it was something we enjoyed doing," she said. "When I was a student, there weren't many minorities on campus, so it was a place to enjoy Mexican culture, food, and traditions&#8212;although we're open to everyone. We always have been. We've always had non-Chicano participants."<br/>
 <br/>
 Twelve of this year's 51 dancers are men, and the performance calendar is busier than ever, with shows five or six times per month. The troupe is celebrating its 45th anniversary this spring, with a <a href="http://losmejicas.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/45th-anniversary.html">reunion</a> scheduled for April 29 during <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/">Alumni Weekend</a>. <br/>
 <br/>
 "We had more than 400 alumni at our 40th reunion," said Najera-Ramirez. "Anniversaries are a way of connecting with alums who helped build the group. Few people choose to go into dance professionally&#8212;our graduates are doctors, teachers and lawyers&#8212;but what they learn serves them for the rest of their lives: team building, leadership, public speaking."<br/>
 <br/>
 Los Mejicas provides much-needed community for students like Gomez who are looking to find their footing far from home; the dancers in turn are wonderful role models for their audiences and ambassadors for the campus. "Wherever they perform, on campus or at high school assemblies, parents come up and say, 'I didn't know UCSC has this,' " said Najera-Ramirez. "They are pleased to see that Los Mejicas fosters an appreciation for the beauty and diversity of Mexican culture." <br/>
 <br/>
 Gomez embraces the cultural aspects of folklorico dance, with the colorful costumes and elaborate make-up. "I grew up watching it, so I knew what it was. But I didn't know how intense the footwork is!" she marveled. <br/>
 <br/>
 Brandon Melendez remembers quietly tapping out the intricate footwork during classes. "The footwork was very difficult at first," said Melendez, now in his fourth year with Los Mejicas. Now a co-director of the group, he, too, says folklorico helped him connect with his cultural roots. As a classical studies major, Melendez has always enjoyed the art of storytelling, and he appreciates the themes of courtship, marriage, and rejection that are represented in folklorico's traditional dances&#8212;as well as the social aspect of performing.<br/>
 <br/>
 "I started out shy and timid, and now everyone calls me The Loud One," says Melendez, smiling. He embraces gritos, the tradition of shouting with joy and pride while performing. "I definitely grew as a person. I like being loud, showing that pride." <br/>
 <br/>
 Los Mejicas members work hard, spending hours rehearsing and performing together. They forge lasting friendships&#8212;and sometimes more: the troupe has produced several marriages over the years. "The group draws you in, but it's the people who make you want to stay," he said.<br/>
 <br/>
 For Gomez, all the hard work comes together when she performs. <br/>
 <br/>
 "You become that proud dancer," she said. "You go into a different world, where the adrenaline and nerves and excitement fade away. Once you're actually dancing, it just feels amazing."<br/>

<p>Lea&#241;os was awarded $30,000 to support <em>&#161;Eureka</em>!--a multi-platform, half-hour animated documentary and interactive graphic novel that traces key moments of colonial California and the making of the West from Native and Latina/o perspectives.</p>
<p>His documentary blends cartoons, music, and humor to illustrate an alternative social history of California.</p>
<p>Lea&#241;os&#8217;s project was one of 14 new film, audio and interactive media projects documenting vital California subjects and issues that were awarded California Documentary Project grants this year totaling $400,000.</p>
<p>The winning projects ranged from a film about LGBT refugees and asylum seekers in the Bay Area; to a podcast and radio series exploring questions of race, culture and black identity; to a portrait of the Portuguese American community in California&#8217;s Central Valley; to an interactive web-based reflection on the 25th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots from the Korean American community&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>The California Documentary Project supports high-quality humanities-based media projects that seek to document California in all of its complexity. Since 2003, it has awarded over $5 million to film, audio, and interactive media productions that inform and engage broad audiences through multiple means.</p>
<p>&#8220;California Humanities continues to support films and interactive media projects that share stories of California and help us better understand our past, present, and future,&#8221; noted Julie Fry, President &amp; CEO of California Humanities. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud to support these 14 new extraordinary projects.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/09/leanos-pbs-film.html</url><title>UC

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Whether it&#8217;s entrepreneurship or academia, corporate work or a nonprofit mission, there are as many different tracks for graduate students as there are alumni. And this month, graduates from the five UC Santa Cruz academic divisions who have gone out into the world with their advanced degrees will return to campus to be honored during Alumni Weekend.</p>
<p>The five honorees will be presented with the first Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni Awards at an April 29 luncheon. Following that, they&#8217;ll be part of panel discussions where they&#8217;ll share their stories on career and entrepreneurship opportunities, resources for graduate students, the development of leadership skills, and life after graduate school. That will be followed by networking and, weather permitting, star gazing.</p>
<p>A full schedule is available on the <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu">Alumni Weekend website</a>. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The career landscape for UC Santa Cruz graduate students is one with many attractive opportunities that impact different sectors of society, as these distinguished alumni show us,&#8221; said Sonya Newlyn, administrative assistant for the Division of Graduate Studies. &#8220;Their stories are nothing less than inspiring.&#8221;</p>
<p>The five graduate alumni honorees and the academic divisions they represent include the following:</p>
<h3>Claudio Campagna, Physical and Biological Sciences Division</h3>
<p>Campagna is a conservation biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society and adjunct professor and research associate in the campus&#8217;s Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. In addition to earning his Ph.D. in biology from UCSC in 1987, he studied medicine at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
<p>&#8220;His distinguished career extends far beyond his important research on marine ecology and marine mammal biology,&#8221; said Paul Koch, dean of the division of Physical and Biological Sciences. &#8220;He&#8217;s had a real impact in conservation and marine protection&#8212;recognized by his Pew Fellowship and other awards&#8212;and in communication, public outreach, and advocacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campagna is a field conservationist and animal behaviorist working in coastal Patagonia, Argentina, since the 1980s. He founded the Forum of NGOs and works with the IUCN Species Survival Commission. Recognizing the need to promote conservation using creative communication tools, he&#8217;s published widely in scientific journals, written a children&#8217;s book, and just finished a novel.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the viability of changing the vision of the conservation movement by applying concepts developed by language philosophers, he started a project with philosophy Professor Daniel Guevara on the Language of Conservation. It bridges biology and ethics and is inscribed in the Center for Public Philosophy at UCSC.</p>
<h3>Dan Heller, Arts Division</h3>
<p>Heller graduated with his Master of Fine Arts in 2013 from the Digital Arts and New Media program 28 years after he earned his bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science at UC Santa Cruz. Through the years, he&#8217;s become an established technology veteran, with a career that&#8217;s focused on starting or working with companies to commercialize their inventions.</p>
<p>Arts Dean Susan Solt said of Heller, &#8220;He embodies our aspirations, particularly in the areas of creativity and entrepreneurship. We are delighted by his ongoing successes and are happy to have played some part in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>His first startup dates back to the 1980s, when he built the first commercially available email system for the internet. He founded the university&#8217;s Center for Entrepreneurship in 2010, an academic degree program he created for students who would study and collaborate with professors to advance publicly funded research and bring them to market. Most of the intellectual property was in biotech, computer software, social media, and generalized technology solutions.</p>
<p>In 2011, Heller became co-founder and CEO of Two Pore Guys, a life sciences technology company in Santa Cruz.&#160;The startup makes a digital, hand-held medical testing platform using solid-state nanopores.</p>
<h3>Betsy Herbert, Social Sciences Division</h3>
<p>Herbert is an environmental writer and chair of the Science Advisory Panel of the Sempervirens Fund, the oldest land trust in California. Her column in the Santa Cruz Sentinel is called Earth Matters. She also serves on the boards of the Santa Cruz Mountains Bioregional Council and the Center for Farmworker Families.</p>
<p>She is the former environmental programs director for the San Lorenzo Valley Water District, where she oversaw watershed management, climate change greenhouse gas emissions tracking, and environmental grants. A recipient of a Switzer Leadership Award in 2005, Herbert served as community liaison to the town of Felton, facilitating the public acquisition of its water system from California American Water. The water district successfully completed this public acquisition in 2008.</p>
<p>Environmental Studies Professor Daniel Press, who taught Herbert at UC Santa Cruz, where she earned her Ph.D., described her as a renaissance woman, who has reinvented herself over and over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her evolution as a scholar was inspiring to watch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Her research did a wonderful job connecting policy and management to environmental outcomes, specifically water quality and forest health.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now? &#8220;She offers the world a wonderful mosaic made up of rich narrative and imagery, wise counsel, and true heart.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Adam Siepel, Baskin School of Engineering</h3>
<p>Siepel worked in the bioinformatics field and earned his Ph.D. in computer science from UC Santa Cruz. He is a professor in the Watson School of Biological Sciences and chair of the Simons Center for Quantitative Biology at New York&#8217;s Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p>
<p>Originally trained as a computer scientist, he has done influential work in molecular evolution, comparative genomics, human population genetics, and transcriptional regulation. He was a member of the faculty of the department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology at Cornell University from 2006 to 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;His work brought a new understanding of how DNA changes as a species evolves,&#8221; said David Haussler, scientific director of the UCSC Genomics Institute. &#8220;That work contributes both to our basic understanding of life and also to our understanding of disease. The Simons Center that he leads is a major contributor to global scientific knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Emily Sloan-Pace, Humanities Division</h3>
<p>Sloan-Pace started out singing and dancing for a living, and now is a professor-in-residence at Zoho Corporation, a cloud computing company based in Chennai, India.</p>
<p>She earned her doctorate at UC Santa Cruz in 2012 and then stayed to teach courses for the Literature Department, and for Cowell and Stevenson colleges. Now her work involves designing and teaching curriculum aimed at helping Zoho&#8217;s employees improve their written and spoken communication. In her capacity as chief learning officer, Sloan-Pace regularly travels to India to lead workshops and seminars on topics ranging from customer support to marketing to Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Deanna Shemek, professor and chair of the Department of Literature, described Sloan-Pace as a perfect example of how a Ph.D. in literature can have an impact beyond academia.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wrote a fine dissertation on a topic&#8212;women in Shakespeare&#8217;s English history plays&#8212;that is seemingly distant from her current position&#8217;s concerns,&#8220; Shemek said. &#8221;The critical thinking and communication skills required for advanced work in the humanities, though, were exactly what her Silicon Valley employer was looking for. Her position at Zoho is something quite new, an illustration of ways that specialized work in literary studies can be highly generalizable and valued outside, as well as inside, academic education.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6cfbd2088072701721a2b70e3f6651c8"><name>harry-huskey-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer pioneer Harry Huskey dies at age 101</title><summary>Harry Huskey, professor emeritus of computer science, worked on early computing systems and  helped universities around the world establish  computer science programs.</summary><keywords>Harry Huskey</keywords><start-date>1492153200000</start-date><display-name>Computer pioneer Harry Huskey dies at age 101</display-name><path>/2017/04/harry-huskey-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/harry-huskey-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1492182092972</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1492190620843</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/harry-huskey-1-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/harry-huskey-1-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>harry-huskey-1-350.jpg</name><display-name>harry-huskey-1-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>82169</file-size><width>350</width><height>505</height></image><image-alt>Harry Huskey</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/harry-huskey-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/harry-huskey-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>harry-huskey-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>harry-huskey-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18939</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Harry Huskey</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Harry Huskey</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/huskey-g15-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/huskey-g15-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>huskey-g15-350.jpg</name><display-name>huskey-g15-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>100129</file-size><width>350</width><height>445</height></image><image-alt>Harry Huskey with Bendix G15</image-alt><image-caption>Harry Huskey with the Bendix G15, the first "personal computer."</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Harry Huskey, a pioneering computer scientist who worked on early computing systems and later helped universities around the world establish computer centers and computer science programs, died on April 9 at his home in Santa Cruz. He was 101.</p>
<p>A professor emeritus of computer science at UC Santa Cruz, Huskey began his career teaching mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. There, he worked on the famed ENIAC project in the 1940s. ENIAC was the first large-scale electronic computer, containing 18,000 vacuum tubes, and Huskey was among the last surviving members of the ENIAC team.</p>
<p>In 1947, Huskey spent a year in England, where he worked with Alan Turing on a prototype of Turing's Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) computer. He joined the staff of the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in 1948 and was responsible for the design and construction of the National Bureau of Standards Western Automatic Computer (SWAC), the fastest computer of its time. While he was building the SWAC computer, Huskey was a contestant on Groucho Marx's <em>You Bet Your Life</em> radio show. Introduced as the designer of an "electronic brain," he was paired with a junk dealer on the May 10, 1950, episode.</p>
<p>Huskey later served as a consultant to the Bendix Computer Division of Bendix Corporation, where he was primarily responsible for the design of the Bendix G15 computer. Designed for use by a single person, the G15 has been called the first "personal computer," although it was the size of a refrigerator, with an equally large tape unit for additional storage. Huskey had a G15 installed in his home in Berkeley in 1955 and later kept it in his Santa Cruz garage before donating it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1988.</p>
<p>Huskey was on the faculty at UC Berkeley from 1954 until 1967, when he moved to UC Santa Cruz and became a founding faculty member of the computer and information science program. He set up the UCSC Computer Center and served as its director for over ten years. During his time at UC Santa Cruz, Huskey advised universities in many countries on how to develop academic computer science programs and establish computer centers. He retired in 1986 at the age of 70.</p>
<p>Born in North Carolina and raised in Idaho, Huskey earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics at the University of Idaho and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics at Ohio State University. The recipient of many awards and honors, Huskey was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the British Computer Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He received the 1984 Centennial Award from the IEEE and the 1982 Computer Pioneer Award from the IEEE Computer Society, and he was honored at the Pioneer Session of the National Computer Conference in 1978. In 2013, he was honored as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Baskin School of Engineering and Office of Research at UC Santa Cruz presented Huskey with the Founding Faculty Award for his role in founding what is now the school's Department of Computer Science. Many of the earliest alumni and faculty attended the event to congratulate Huskey.</p>
<p>"I'm glad we got Harry here to see what has grown from the seeds he helped plant and nurture," said Patrick Mantey, the Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering and founding dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. "He was already a legend in computing when I was early in my career."</p>
<p>Huskey had four children with his wife, Velma, who died in 1991. In 1994, he married Nancy Whitney, who died in 2015. Huskey is survived by three daughters, a son, five grandchildren, and one great grandchild.</p>
<p>Funeral services will be held at Santa Cruz Memorial (1927 Ocean Street Extension) at 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 15.</p>
<p><em>To recognize and honor Huskey's many accomplishments and to allow his legacy to live on, particularly in the area of international engineering education, his family and two close friends from UC Santa Cruz have created the Harry Huskey Endowment for International Engineering Education at UC Santa Cruz (<a href="https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=780&amp;cid=1656&amp;dids=801&amp;bledit=1">Huskey Endowment</a></em><em>).</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6d3c0ce88072701721a2b70e0ec81a2d"><name>sea-level-report</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Climate experts release latest science on sea level rise projections</title><summary>A report led by UCSC geologist Gary Griggs addresses how much the ocean will rise along California's coast in coming decades.</summary><keywords>Gary Griggs, sea level rise</keywords><start-date>1492153200000</start-date><display-name>Climate experts release latest science on sea level rise projections</display-name><path>/2017/04/sea-level-report</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/sea-level-report</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1492186302323</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1492186563791</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Publications</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Samuel Chiu, California Natural Resources Agency</name><title></title><phone/><email>sam.chiu@resources.ca.gov</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/report-cover.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/report-cover.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>report-cover.jpg</name><display-name>report-cover.jpg</display-name><file-size>115201</file-size><width>400</width><height>519</height></image><image-alt>report cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/report-cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/report-cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>report-cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>report-cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20858</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>report cover image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a compelling analysis of the factors that affect how much the ocean will rise along California's coast in coming decades, a seven-member team of experts led by UC Santa Cruz geologist Gary Griggs has issued a report on the best-available sea-level rise science.</p>
<p>The report includes recent scientific advances on the role of polar ice loss and new information on the expected sea level changes that will occur based on different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. For example, with very successful mitigation efforts, the report states that there is a 67 percent probability that the Bay Area will experience sea level rise between 1.0 foot and 2.4 feet by 2100. However, if no significant mitigation efforts are taken, that range increases to 1.6 to 3.4 feet.</p>
<p>The report also emphasizes the importance of preparing for extreme but uncertain scenarios involving the rapid loss of the Antarctic ice sheet, which would have an enormous impact on coastal regions. In one such scenario, sea levels along California&#8217;s coastline could rise up to 10 feet by 2100, about 30 to 40 times faster than sea-level rise experienced over the last century.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although our scientific understanding is rapidly increasing, waiting for scientific certainty about the rate or ultimate amount of sea-level rise is neither a safe nor prudent option,&#8221; said Griggs, chair of the science team and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Santa Cruz. &#8220;The sea-level rise projections presented in this report provide the scientific foundation for taking action today, preparing our coastal communities and mitigating hazards, and preventing much greater losses than will occur without action now.&#8221;</p>
<p>An estimated 75 percent of California's population lives in coastal counties. Sea-level rise, already underway, threatens hundreds of miles of roads and railways, harbors, airports, power plants, wastewater treatment plants, coastal wetlands, beaches, dunes, bluffs, and thousands of businesses and homes.</p>
<p>The new science report was requested by the California Ocean Protection Council and the California Natural Resources Agency, in collaboration with the Governor's Office of Planning and Research, the California Energy Commission, and the California Ocean Science Trust. Expertise on the scientific team includes risk assessment, climatic change, ice sheet behavior, and statistical modeling.</p>
<p>The science report will be presented on April 26 at a meeting in Sacramento of the Ocean Protection Council. The report provides the scientific basis for updating statewide policy, which guides state and local decisions along California shorelines.</p>
<p>"California leads the way in both addressing climate change and protecting our coastal and ocean communities and resources," said Jenn Eckerle, deputy director of the Ocean Protection Council. "Our statewide policy on sea-level rise is another example of that leadership."</p>
<p>The previous report, released in 2010 and updated in 2013, included a range of projections over various timescales, but did not estimate the likelihood that such levels would be met. The scientific team's new report includes information on the likelihood of specific scenarios and provides a framework for evaluating risk, adaptive capacity, and consequences from rising seas. This will allow local and state stakeholders to weigh the costs and benefits of taking action now against the potential harmful effects of inaction.</p>
<p>The science report will inform California&#8217;s sea-level rise guidance document, which will help cities and counties as they comply with state law that requires them to incorporate climate change into their planning efforts. The updated guidance document will also assist state agencies prepare for and adapt to sea level rise, as directed by Governor Brown&#8217;s April 2015 executive order on climate change. Public input will be integrated into the final guidance document update, which is scheduled for adoption by the California Ocean Protection Council in January 2018.</p>
<p>The seven scientists who synthesized the latest science as a working group of the Ocean Protection Council&#8217;s science advisory team are Gary Griggs, UC Santa Cruz; Dan Cayan, Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Claudia Tebaldi, National Center for Atmospheric Research; Helen Amanda Fricker, Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Joe Arvai, University of Michigan; Rob DeConto, University of Massachusetts; and Robert E. Kopp, Rutgers University.</p>
<p>Among their key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific understanding of sea-level rise is advancing at a rapid pace. Projections of future sea-level rise, under high emissions scenarios, have increased substantially over the last few years, primarily due to new and improved understanding of mass loss from continental ice sheets.</li>
<li>The rate of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets is increasing. These ice sheets will soon become the primary contributor to global sea-level rise, overtaking the contributions from ocean thermal expansion and melting mountain glaciers and ice caps.</li>
<li>Mountain glaciers contain enough ice to raise sea levels by only about 1.5 feet. In contrast, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contain enough ice to raise global mean sea level by 24 feet and 187 feet, respectively. Although these ice sheets are not expected to melt completely, even on century or millennial timescales, the loss of even a small fraction of either of these huge ice sheets could have devastating consequences for global shorelines.</li>
<li>For California, ice loss from Antarctica, and especially from West Antarctica, causes higher sea-level rise than the global average. For every 1 foot of global sea-level rise caused by loss of ice on West Antarctic, sea-level will rise approximately 1.25 feet along the California coast.</li>
<li>After 2050, sea-level rise projections increasingly depend on the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>While model results have revealed the potential for high rates of ice loss and extreme sea-level rise during this century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, the precise magnitude and timing of when the Antarctic Ice Sheet may begin to contribute substantially to rising sea levels is uncertain.</li>
<li>It is clear that sea-levels are rising. As cities, counties, and state agencies make decisions about adaptation and hazard mitigation efforts, it is increasingly important to incorporate long-range planning for sea-level rise. Consideration of high and even extreme sea levels in decisions with implications past 2050 is needed to safeguard the people and resources of coastal California.</li>

The two-year grant will help cover instructional costs, fund an expansion of the program's digital media training, and support efforts to recruit a diverse cohort of graduate students.</p>
<p>"We are grateful that Hearst recognized our pivotal role during a time when accurate and engaging science communication is more important than ever," said program director Erika Check Hayden. "As the only science communication graduate program based at a public university, we provide the highest quality of instruction to students who represent the face of California and the nation."</p>
<p>Founded in 1981, the Science Communication Program focuses on practical training through rigorous coursework and diverse internships. It is the only graduate science writing program in the United States that requires a degree in science and experience in research. Graduates of the program work as reporters and editors at the nation's top newspapers, science magazines, online news services, research agencies, universities, and medical centers.</p>
<p>The program's multimedia curriculum is designed to meet the growing demand for full multimedia proficiency in entry-level journalism positions. The Hearst grant will fund a significant upgrade of digital media training through new equipment purchases and instruction from experts in the field.</p>
<p>The director is the program's sole faculty member, with additional instruction provided by professional journalists and guest editors. Much of the grant will be used to support this corps of nationally prominent lecturers and guest editors, who train students to professional standards and help open career doors for the program's graduates. The grant will also support recruitment efforts, including outreach to communities that have been underrepresented in the science communication field.</p>

The sale offers the region&#8217;s largest offering of organically grown vegetable, herb, and flower starts, along with a wide variety of landscape plants.<br/>
<br/>
 The Spring Plant Sale takes place Saturday, April 29, and Sunday, April 30, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the base of the UCSC campus, near the intersection of Bay and High Streets in Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 The sale will be open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. On Saturday, members of the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden can enjoy a &#8220;members&#8217; hour&#8221; starting at 9 a.m. (new memberships and renewals are available starting at 8:30 a.m.). The event also hosts a free seed exchange sponsored by UCSC&#8217;s Demeter Seed Library on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. You&#8217;ll find free open-pollinated and heirloom seeds to grow out for your own garden and to share with the library.<br/>
<br/>
 This spring marks the 50th anniversary of Chadwick&#8217;s arrival at UC Santa Cruz, where the British master gardener introduced his signature approach to organic, raised bed gardening at UCSC&#8217;s Student Garden Project (now the Alan Chadwick Garden).<br/>
<br/>
 For vegetable growers, this year&#8217;s sale will feature a great selection of tomatoes and peppers (sweet and hot), including the signature &#8216;Chadwick&#8217;s Cherry Tomato&#8217;, and his favorite lettuce, &#8216;Kentucky Bibb&#8217;, along with eggplants, Asian greens, summer and winter squashes, pumpkins, leeks, a wide variety of basil, cucumbers, kale, and more.<br/>
<br/>
 Flower lovers can choose from an array of annuals perfect for homegrown bouquets and landscape plantings. This year&#8217;s offerings include bachelor&#8217;s buttons, cosmos, hollyhocks, stock, zinnias, and sunflower varieties. Also available are particularly water-thrifty options, including poppies, marigolds, snapdragons, statice, strawflowers, and cosmos.<br/>
<br/>
 Among Chadwick&#8217;s favorites featured this year are perennial landscape plants that also make great cut flowers for bouquets. The roses &#8216;Buff Beauty&#8217;, &#8216;Penelope&#8217;, and &#8216;Will Scarlet&#8217; will be available, along with Veronica spicata &#8216;Chadwick&#8217;s Especiale&#8217;, woolly lamb&#8217;s ear, and flowering tobacco.<br/>
<br/>
 Other popular landscape plants include a selection of salvia, lavender, and rosemary, and marjoram varieties. Look for butterfly bush, delphiniums, lemon balm, coral bells, Ribes, and gerbera daisies, along with kangaroo paws and yarrow. Several blackberry and raspberry varieties, including golden raspberry, will also be available. Many of the perennials will be priced at a special rate of 3 for $20 in gallon containers.<br/>
<br/>
 The Spring Plant Sale proceeds help support the operation of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden and the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden receive a 10% discount on purchases.<br/>

Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation.</p>
<p>The Goldwater Scholarship is a prestigious national competition for undergraduates in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. The scholarships provide up to $7,500 per year for sophomores and juniors from across the country to cover the costs of tuition, fees, books, and other expenses.</p>
<p>The foundation awarded 240 scholarships this year, selecting the scholars on the basis of academic merit from a field of 1,286 students nominated by representatives of colleges and universities nationwide.</p>
<p>Antoni is a junior majoring in physics (astrophysics). Since participating in the Lamat Summer Undergraduate Research Program in 2015, she has been working on astrophysics research projects with Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, and graduate students Morgan MacLeod, Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, and Phillip Macias. Their recent collaboration, studying the common envelope phase in the evolution of close binary systems, resulted in a paper published March 20 in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. Antoni's career goal is to earn a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics so she can conduct research in theoretical astrophysics and teach at a research university.</p>
<p>The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program was established by Congress in 1986 to honor Senator Barry Goldwater. The scholarship program was designed to foster and encourage outstanding students to pursue careers in the fields of mathematics, the natural sciences, and engineering. The Goldwater Scholarship is the premier undergraduate award of its type in these fields.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7d82e1208072701721a2b70e10db6840"><name>420-impacts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>April 20 DUI checkpoint and law enforcement efforts</title><summary>Members of the UC Santa Cruz community and campus neighbors, please be advised there is the potential for traffic disruptions and hazards during the afternoon of Thursday, April 20 because of the unsanctioned gathering known as “4–20”.</summary><start-date>1492412400000</start-date><display-name>Law enforcement</display-name><path>/2017/04/420-impacts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/420-impacts</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1492459379331</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1492459379331</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Members of the UC Santa Cruz community and campus neighbors, please be advised there is the potential for traffic disruptions and hazards during the afternoon of Thursday, April 20 because of the <strong>unsanctioned</strong> gathering known as &#8220;4&#8211;20&#8221;. The greatest impact is expected from 3&#8211;6 p.m.</p>
<p>As the chief of police, my primary responsibility is the health and safety of our community. Similar to 2016, we will have an increased law enforcement presence with additional UC police officers, as well as allied law enforcement agencies throughout the campus conducting enforcement activities. These officers will conduct enhanced patrols throughout the day, looking for individuals in violation of the law, including the possession of and/or using marijuana and alcohol or other drugs; drivers under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol; and will enforce unpermitted vending of any merchandise, food, services, or medical marijuana on the campus. Campus parking regulations will also be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>In addition to these enforcement efforts, the <strong>Santa Cruz Area CHP will be conducting a DUI checkpoint near the west side of campus</strong>, aggressively seeking those who choose to drive under the influence. It is our goal to use this enforcement tool to assist with the reduction of injury and fatal collisions caused by impaired drivers. Last year there were three arrests for driving under the influence as a result of the checkpoint. Recently, we have made several DUI arrests, including an injury accident near Family Student Housing in the early morning hours of Friday, April 14.</p>
<p>Please plan accordingly and anticipate possible disruptions to traffic due to the large groups of people that may be present, especially on the west side of campus. Campus and Metro bus service may be delayed. Traffic diversion measures may be instituted if needed to alleviate impacted areas. If driving a vehicle, be alert for increased pedestrian traffic on all roadways, as well as the signage indicating the presence of the DUI checkpoint.</p>
<p>Last year, in addition to the DUI arrests, two others, on their way to the meadow, were arrested for felony possession of a loaded firearm and possession of marijuana with the intent to sell. We also made arrests for felony possession of a knife and club, battery on an officer, drunk in public, resisting arrests, and issued numerous citations. Many of the individuals arrested or cited for illegal activity were not campus affiliates, and had no concern for the safety of our students.</p>
<p>There are potentially serious consequences of choosing to attend. We ask that individuals consider the risks and possible criminal penalties. Individuals affiliated with the campus are also subject to sanctions by the Student Conduct Office or Human Resources.</p>
<p>As we continue to talk about the impacts of drugs and alcohol on this campus, and to the greater Santa Cruz community, it is also important to know the facts around Proposition 64 as it pertains to the recreational use of marijuana at UC Santa Cruz. You should know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possession and/or use of marijuana in any form (edibles, plant, concentrated, vaporized, etc.) on the campus, or any university property is not legal.</li>
<li>Medical marijuana is not allowed on campus.</li>
<li>It is not legal for any person to smoke or ingest marijuana in a public place, both on and off campus.</li>
<li>It is not legal to drive a vehicle or ride a bicycle impaired or under the influence of marijuana.</li>
<li>It is not legal to possess marijuana for sale, transport, import, furnish, or give away marijuana.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to the health and safety of our community. We know that this can be a challenging day for our students who are substance free or who are trying to stay away from those using marijuana. As such, the Cove and SHOP teams are sponsoring <strong>The Other 420</strong> event at the Cove. More information can be found at <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu">shop.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Tick Activity It should also be noted that spring is a time of high tick activity on the campus, and throughout the county coastal hills. Ticks may carry other tick-borne diseases, so please take precautions to protect yourselves from tick bites. The risk of being bitten by tick, and the precautions you can take to protect yourself can be found here: <a href="http://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/documents/TickInfo.pdf">http://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/safety-ih/documents/TickInfo.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Poison Oak Poison Oak is across campus and avoiding contact with the plan is the best prevention. The campus community is encouraged to learn about the plant&#8217;s appearance and steer clear of it. Information from the CDC about poison oak and precautions one can take can be found here: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-118/default.html">https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010&#8211;118/default.html</a>.</p>
<p>Please remember to take care of one another. As always, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>please do not delay</strong></span> in seeking assistance for yourself or another needing help by dialing 911.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7d9056058072701721a2b70e1abcf4e3"><name>draft-sustainability-plan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Draft sustainability plan open for feedback</title><summary>The draft Campus Sustainability Plan is available for review and input.

<p>I&#8217;m excited to share a draft of our next <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/governance/plans-reports/campus-sust-plan/index.html">Campus Sustainability Plan</a> (CSP), which helps to chart a course into 2022. The plan is the result of hard work from several committees made up of folks from all over campus who have spent this academic year looking at how we can advance sustainability in every part of our university.</p>
<p>Now, you have the opportunity to contribute your thoughts.</p>
<p>Tell us what you think about our goals, our strategies, and what we should tackle in the first year.</p>
<p>While the campus made <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/governance/files/2016%20UCSC%20Sustainability%20Annual%20Report.pdf">significant progress</a> in the sustainability of its operations in the <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/governance/files/CSP_2013_2016.pdf">previous plan</a>, the planning committees have expanded the scope of this new plan. The plan focuses on four areas: Learning &amp; Culture, Materials Management &amp; Food Systems, Natural Environment &amp; Infrastructure, and Climate &amp; Energy. Goals, strategies, and first-year actions are under consideration within these four topics that acknowledge the intersectional nature of environmental and social issues, build on the strength of existing policies and programs, enhance ties between operations and academics, and connect social justice issues on campus and in our local community.</p>
<p>The plan aims to tackle many difficult questions. How will Banana Slugs achieve UC Office of the President&#8217;s goal of Carbon Neutrality by 2025? How can the campus enhance experiential learning opportunities for students in sustainability? What resources does the campus need in the next three years in order to reach Zero Waste by 2020?

<p>The meeting, the latest event in the Beyond Compliance initiative, offered overviews of employment law and Title IX investigations, updates on policy revisions and education and training efforts, and previews into possible changes to policy and procedures. The meeting ended with a question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>Speakers representing different campus constituencies noted the need to develop and maintain a culture that encourages everyone to report allegations of sexual misconduct&#8212;even if they're second or third-hand&#8212;to the Title IX Office. The reports allow the Title IX Office to identify patterns, which can lead to informal investigations or even investigations initiated by the office.</p>
<p>This focus on accountability would contribute to a change in behavioral norms on campus.</p>
<p>Acting Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Martin Berger noted that it takes great bravery from students to report sexual violence and sexual harassment and that faculty must follow their lead.</p>
<p>"To faculty, I say we should be that brave. We have to step up at least to the degree we expect from our students," said Berger, a co-chair of the Beyond Compliance initiative. "We are educators, but nothing is more important than keeping our students safe."</p>
<p>Tracey Tsugawa, the campus Title IX Officer, reported that the campus has received more than 250 reports of sexual misconduct this academic year and has launched more than 30 formal investigations, continuing the pattern of increasing numbers of reports over the past several years.</p>
<p>"We view this as a good thing," Tsugawa said. "We know the numbers really represent only a small percentage of what's really going on but the increase means that people are more aware of these issues and more willing to come forward. Still, many people, for very valid reasons, are reluctant to report incidents; this means we have much more work to do."</p>
<p>Sexual misconduct investigations are confidential for several reasons, she said. The confidentiality is meant to protect the privacy of all parties involved, to ensure the integrity of the investigations, and to prevent retaliation during an investigation.</p>
<p>In certain situations, campus employees are considered &#8220;need to know&#8221; and made aware of investigations so they can help to keep someone safe. For example, a department chair may be made aware of a case if it involves a staff member and a faculty member in the department to help monitor and enforce a no-contact directive.</p>
<p>A student in the audience commented that many students are still unaware about consent. Under the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment, consent is affirmative, conscious, voluntary, and revocable. Because this definition of consent is a new concept, it requires more education and for people to change how they behave towards each other.</p>
<p>Isabel Dees, an investigator with the Title IX Office, said she knows that can be overcome. "We have to ask permission for everything," Dees said. "Why is sex any different?"</p>
<p>Beyond Compliance Co-chair Kim Lau said faculty must take the lead on shifting culture.</p>
<p>"It's a massive paradigm shift," she said. "We are well-poised to do that work."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service</link><site>news</site><name>an-ethic-of-service</name><display-name>Beyond Compliance -- An Ethic of Service</display-name><title>Beyond Compliance &#8212; An Ethic of Service</title><summary>This spring, Alison Galloway is convening a dialogue to bring together Academic Senate leaders, students, and faculty members.

<p>UC Observatories, Lick Observatory, and the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics are joining forces to put on a Star Party, replete with jazz, informative talks from foremost experts on astronomy, constellation identification, and telescopes for viewing celestial objects once night falls.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to bring Lick Observatory down the mountain,&#8221; said Ilse Ungeheuer, communications specialist at UC Observatories/Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, just east of San Jose, is part of University of California Observatories (UCO), a multicampus research institution headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. It is housed in the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, along with the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department.</p>
<p>Asher Wasserman is an astronomy graduate student and member of the UCSC Astronomy club, which owns 10 amateur telescopes that will be at the Star Party.</p>
<p>The event is not only an opportunity for interdepartmental collaboration, but an opportunity for alumni and the campus community to get together and explore the stars.</p>
<p>Wasserman studies the motions of stars in distant galaxies and how that motion relates to the composition of dark matter.</p>
<p>He says that while he is busy making progress in his highly technical niche, he relishes the opportunity to share in the general public&#8217;s fascination with moons, stars, telescopes, nebulas, black holes whirling planets, spinning galaxies, and the other wonders of extraterrestrial space.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely see that a fundamental part of my job as an astronomer is to convey to people what it is I do,&#8221; said Wasserman.</p>
<p>If the weather cooperates on the last Saturday in April, Wasserman will have the opportunity to do just that. He won&#8217;t be alone.</p>
<p>The Star Party&#8212;slated to begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, April 29 at the Oakes College Lower Lawn&#8212;will feature a robust roster of speakers, including Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8232;</p>
<p>Blumenthal, a renown astrophysicist whose pioneering work on the theory of cold, dark matter remains a standard explanation for the formation of galaxy and galaxy clusters, will give the opening remarks.</p>
<p>Professor of Astronomy Ryan Foley, who studies supernovae or exploding stars, will give a brief talk about current research at UC Santa Cruz and Lick Observatory. He will be followed by Connie Rockosi, a professor and astronomer with Lick Observatory, who will introduce the telescope viewing of the evening and also elaborate on astronomy at UCSC and Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>In keeping with the spirit of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s emphasis on interdisciplinary education, Ungeheuer, who previously worked as a dramaturg and artistic production officer for the Berlin State Opera in Germany, has enlisted the UCSC Student Jazz Ensemble to provide melodic ambience, featuring works about stars, night, and the universe. The concept of alternating talks and music from 7&#8211;9 p.m. will gently lead everyone into the dark night of a waxing crescent moon. Star gazing begins after 9 pm.</p>
<p>The event will also bring together three groups of amateur astronomers (UCSC astronomy students, the Santa Cruz Astronomy Club, and Lick Observatory Volunteer Amateur Astronomers) who will share their telescopes and knowledge with everyone. They will provide a range of telescopes for viewings and if the sky is clear, attendees will be able to see distant phenomena such as the Orion nebula, the open star cluster called the Beehive cluster, Jupiter, and the Galilean moons. Weather permitting, visible constellations in the night sky will be Ursa Major, Leo, Gemini, and Virgo.</p>
<p>The Galilean moons&#8212;Ganymede, Io, Europa, and Callisto&#8212;were the first celestial objects humans saw that were not visible to the naked eye. They were first seen by famed astronomer Galileo in 1610.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the story behind the science,&#8221; Wasserman said. &#8220;Discovering the moons of Jupiter changed our view of the solar system and our place in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attendees are encouraged to bring their own chairs or blankets.</p>
<p>The event is planned to run through 11 p.m. About 200 stargazers are expected to attend. The event is open to all alumni, and the campus community.

The <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers">Exoplanet Explorers</a> project, launched in early April on <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a>, a popular citizen science platform, has already identified nearly 200 candidate planets, including a new four-planet system.</p>
<p>Crossfield's team had been working with Zooniverse for months to develop the project when they got a surprise invitation to have it featured on a live television program, 'ABC Stargazing Live', to be broadcast in Australia. The researchers quickly got the project ready to launch, uploading two large sets of data for volunteers to classify. The program, hosted by British astronomer Brian Cox and Australian television personality Julia Zemiro, was presented over three nights starting April 4. More than 10,000 users participated in the project in the first 48 hours, generating more than 2 million classifications.</p>
<p>"It would have taken our small team months to wade through all this data, so this is very useful for us. And we got thousands of people interested in the science of exoplanets," said Crossfield, a Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Santa Cruz. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>K2 Mission</strong></p>
<p>Crossfield's team is using K2, the continuing mission of NASA's Kepler spacecraft, to search for planets around red dwarf stars. By measuring the brightness of stars, Kepler can detect the periodic dips in brightness that occur when an orbiting planet passes in front of a star. Participants in the Exoplanet Explorers project evaluate plots of K2 data to classify stars according to whether or not they show evidence of a planet.</p>
<p>According to team member Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute at Caltech, the four-planet system emerged as a particularly interesting discovery for the Stargazing Live hosts to showcase on the third night of the program. The four planets orbit a sun-like host star and are all "super-Earths" (larger than Earth but smaller than ice giants like Neptune), with orbital periods shorter than 12.5 days, she said. Host Brian Cox called the results "astonishing," and Christiansen and Crossfield are preparing a paper on their findings. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Planet statistics</strong></p>
<p>The research team is interested in gathering statistics on the abundance of different types of planets orbiting different types of stars. When astronomers began discovering planets outside our own solar system a couple of decades ago, it became apparent that Earth is not a typical planet in a typical planetary system. With enough observations, astronomers can begin to make generalizations about planetary systems throughout our galaxy.</p>
<p>"These observations can tell us about the typical end products of the planet formation process," Crossfield said. So far, the candidate planets identified by Exoplanet Explorers include 44 Jupiters, 72 Neptunes, 53 super-Earths, and 15 Earth-sized planets.</p>
<p>Crossfield worked with four UC Santa Cruz undergraduates&#8212;Nithesh Balasubramanian, Nicholas Gehlken, Yyue Yu, and Nihaal Zaveri&#8212;to develop the Exoplanet Explorers program. Other key members of the team, in addition to Christiansen, were Geert Barentsen at NASA Ames Research Center and Chris Lintott and Grant Miller at Zooniverse.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/ianc2/exoplanet-explorers</url><title>Exoplanet Explorers Project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8346538e8072701721a2b70ed3bfa685"><name>karen-fry-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Karen Fry (1948–2017)</title><summary>Karen Fry, a UCSC staff member for 29 years, passed away on April 2 in Paradise, California.</summary><start-date>1492498800000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Karen Fry (1948–2017)</display-name><path>/2017/04/karen-fry-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/karen-fry-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1492556074548</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1492615304210</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/karen-fry-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/karen-fry-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karen-fry-300.jpg</name><display-name>karen-fry-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>51554</file-size><width>300</width><height>329</height></image><image-alt>Karen Fry</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/karen-fry-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/karen-fry-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karen-fry-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>karen-fry-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13395</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Karen Fry</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Karen Fry</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We are very sad to share with you that Karen Fry, the wonderful administrative manager of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry from 2004 to 2010, passed away on April 2 in Paradise, California, with her husband Raymond Miller at her side. She was 68 years old and had waged a heroic battle with cancer for several years.</p>
<p>Karen worked for the university in various capacities for 29 years. She first worked in the Graduate Division and then in Contracts and Grants, where she helped faculty submit their grant proposals. She was very organized, had a keen understanding of bureaucracy, paid close attention to detail, and she was always willing to go the extra mile to help faculty and researchers succeed. No task was too small or too big for Karen, and many of us will forever treasure her tireless efforts on our behalf when we were sending off proposals, often at the last minute. &#160;</p>
<p>Karen worked as Assistant Director of Development for Physical and Biological Sciences from 2001 to 2004, at which time she joined the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. She was an exceptional administrative manager and a great team player. We are all very grateful for her positive attitude and the time she spent making sure the department ran smoothly. Karen was particularly helpful to our new faculty, making sure their often stressful pre-tenure years were as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>Karen was not just a superb manager, but also a wonderful person and a dear friend. She got to know numerous faculty members, staff, and students, many of whom have very fond memories of working with her and recall her upbeat personality, kindness, and warmth.</p>
<p>After retiring in 2010, Karen and Ray moved to Paradise, California, where she was a volunteer at Feather River Hospital (RH) for seven years. She also served with Meals on Wheels, was President of the 2016 Volunteer Board, and the editor of Pink Feather, the newsletter for FRH volunteers. Karen was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and she loved ancestry, antiques, and travel.</p>
<p>Karen is survived by her husband, Raymond Miller; brother, Michael Varner; stepson, Matthew Miller; stepdaughter, Erin Miller; three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. A Celebration of Life for Karen will be held Sunday, April 23, 3 p.m., at Paradise Alliance Church, 6491 Clark Road in Paradise.</p>
<p>The family suggests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to: Paradise Meals on Wheels, P.O. Box 342, Paradise, CA 95967, or Barry R. Kirshner Wildlife Sanctuary, P.O. Box 841, Durham, CA 95938.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="873402dd8072701721a2b70e4bd4be6f"><name>climate-videos</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC launches climate video series featuring UCSC alumnus M.

Hosted by UC Santa Cruz alumnus M. Sanjayan, a conservation scientist and visiting researcher at UCLA, the series features eye-opening conversations with experts, scientists, thought leaders, and activists about how everything from clean energy to food, religion to smartphones, affects the future of our planet.</p>
<p><em>Climate Lab</em> videos will be featured on the UC Climate Solutions website (<a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/climate-lab">climate.universityofcalifornia.edu</a>) and Vox&#8217;s YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/vox">youtube.com/vox</a>) with a host of related content, including infographics, quizzes, and articles.</p>
<p>UC faculty have been deeply engaged in research and scholarship around climate change for decades. In 2013, President Janet Napolitano launched the Carbon Neutrality Initiative to expand and strengthen that legacy, establishing a systemwide goal of UC becoming carbon neutral by 2025. To date, energy efficiency measures and clean energy projects implemented across the UC system have generated savings of $28 million a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;As <em>Climate Lab</em> shows, investments in research and technology are critically important as we work to address global climate disruption,&#8221; Napolitano said. &#8220;Achieving carbon neutrality and addressing climate change are not merely operational or research goals at the University of California &#8212; they are moral imperatives. That&#8217;s why I launched the Carbon Neutrality Initiative and committed UC to becoming carbon neutral in our operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The series&#8217; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkZ7BJQupVA">first episode</a>, &#8220;Why humans are so bad at thinking about climate change,&#8221; debuts April 19 on Vox, just in time for Earth Day. Additional Climate Lab episodes will premiere on Vox&#8212;the general interest news brand from Vox Media&#8212;every Wednesday for the next five weeks. Powered by the nation&#8217;s top experts in the fields of climate research, renewable energy, and sustainability, the series showcases those at UC and other institutions and organizations discussing the surprising ways people can harness known and emerging technologies to address the complex problem of climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate change is the biggest issue of our time,&#8221; says Sanjayan. &#8220;It can seem overwhelming, but in <em>Climate Lab</em>, we meet some amazing people from all walks of life who are breaking the problem down and actually making a difference. We hope to inspire viewers to transform the planet by taking some of the ideas in this series and spreading them across the world."</p>

 <br/>
 This year marks the 50th anniversary of that garden, and a series of events will celebrate the valued and enduring contributions the campus has made, now under the auspices of the internationally recognized Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. <br/>
 <br/>
 The festivities include the arrival in April of 39 apprentice farmers and gardeners, heirs to the legacy of those who created the first garden in 1967; a three-day "First Fifty" celebration in July; and the annual Fall Harvest Festival in October; details below.<br/>
 <br/>
 "We've led the movement toward a healthy, socially just food system for 50 years," said Daniel Press, the Center's executive director and UC Santa Cruz professor of environmental studies. "Our vision of a sustainable food system encompasses environmentally sound farming, as well as safe working conditions and livable wages for the people who work in it." <br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Background</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 Over the decades, the grassroots effort begun in 1967 by legendary English master gardener Alan Chadwick and a cohort of students has evolved into a hub of teaching, hands-on learning, pioneering research, and advocacy for people who grow, process, and distribute food. <br/>
 <br/>
 During 50 years of growing farmers and the food movement, Center students, staff, faculty, and collaborators have:<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8226; Pioneered organic farming methods for high-value, chemical-intensive crops like strawberries<br/>
 &#8226; Created the nation&#8217;s first university-based program in agroecology, a scientific approach that emphasizes the ecology of farming systems<br/>
 &#8226; Trained more than 1,500 apprentice organic farmers and gardeners <br/>
 &#8226; Broadened agricultural policy to include issues of social justice and worker welfare<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Coverage opportunities</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strawberry research</span><br/>
 The Center's <a href="http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2017/03/strawberry-fields-for-better/">path-breaking research</a> on organic pest and disease controls offers strawberry growers alternatives to methyl bromide and other soil fumigants. <br/>
 <br/>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Undergraduate engagement</span><br/>
 Hundreds of UCSC undergraduates learn the fundamentals of organic farming and gardening through "hands-on" classes and internships at the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden; students can choose a concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems offered by the Environmental Studies Department.<br/>
 <br/>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture</span><br/>
 This year's apprentices include educators, urban farmers and gardeners, youth empowerment advocates, three graduate students, and several recent college graduates; the Class of 2017 begins April 10 with participants from across California, as well as Oregon, Washington, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Africa.<br/>
 <br/>
 Notable apprenticeship graduates include:<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8226; Karen Washington of Rise and Root Farm, Orange County, New York, winner of the James Beard Leadership Award, Ebony magazine&#8217;s Power 100!, and numerous other honors<br/>
 &#8226; Matt McCue, co-founder of the Farmer-Veteran Coalition and of the Shooting Star CSA in Fairfax, CA <br/>
 &#8226; Jason Mark, executive editor of Sierra magazine and co-founder of Alemany Farm in San Francisco<br/>
 &#8226; Tim Crews, research director of The Land Institute in Salina, Kansas<br/>
 &#8226; Nancy Vail and Jared Lawson, founders of Pie Ranch, a Pescadero-based farm that promotes education and social justice <br/>
 &#8226; Matthew Raiford, founder of Gilliard Farm in Brunswick, Georgia<br/>
 <br/>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Real food" programs</span><br/>
 The Center spearheaded UC&#8217;s systemwide adoption of 20 percent "real food" purchases, driving the university's commitment to buy food that is produced in a fair, humane, and environmentally sustainable manner; UC Santa Cruz is committed to 40 percent "real food" purchases for its dining halls and other food facilities by 2020.<br/>
 <br/>
 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">School food projects</span><br/>
 The Center is improving K&#8211;12 school nutrition programs in 15 school districts in Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz counties. <br/>

Young  Japan </image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><em><strong>In Japan</strong></em> is the title of an elegant new collection of poems from UCSC humanities lecturer and alumnus Gary Young that will soon be published by Ninja Press. <br/>
 <br/>
 The poems were written while Young was in Japan working on a book of translations of the calligraphy of the Zen priest Kobun Chino Otogawa. During this time, he had the great honor of staying in&#160;the Hokyoji Zen Monastery, where he was given access to Zen Master D&#333;gen&#8217;s original manuscripts, calligraphy, and other relics. <br/>
 <br/>
 Young was also a guest in the homes of a number of artists, artisans, and Buddhist priests. He met with Zen priests and Buddhist scholars who he said were extraordinarily generous with their knowledge of Buddhism, calligraphy, and poetry, and were instrumental to his translations. <br/>
 <br/>
 While traveling around Japan and working on the translations, Young also began to work on a series of original poems. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;This was only a few months after the earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster,&#8221; Young noted. &#8220;My poems reflect my joy at being in Japan, but there is an undercurrent of grief and loss throughout the collection.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;In one poem, I describe a Buddhist priest explaining to a group of children what happens when they die, and in another, I meet a man in a temple who holds a photograph of his daughter and directs it to an enormous statue of Buddha while he prays. He unexpectedly turns the photo toward me and continues to pray.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;There was little mention of the catastrophe, but the enormity of the loss seemed to permeate everything.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The new book&#8217;s design, presswork, painting, and binding are all by Carolee Campbell--the sole proprietor of Ninja Press. The text paper is kitakata, handmade in Japan. Each faintly green text sheet is folded at the edge and painted by hand with walnut ink.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Carolee is a brilliant designer and printer, who has a deep interest in and knowledge of Japan,&#8221; said Young. &#8220;I couldn't imagine anyone else printing these poems.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The resulting book is a work of extraordinary restraint, understatement and grace,&#8221; Young added. &#8220;The poems float on a sea of gorgeous handmade paper from Japan, and the elegance of the book's typography, and the precision of the printing have what can only be described as a Zen-like presence.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Young graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1973 and received his M.F.A. from UC Irvine in 1975. He has taught poetry as a lecturer in creative writing in UCSC&#8217;s Literature Department since 2005. Young is also the director of the Cowell Press, where he teaches printing and book arts.<br/>
 <br/>
 His previous books include <em>Pleasure, Hands, The Dream of A Moral Life</em> (winner of the James D. Phelan Award), <em>Days, Braver Deeds</em> (winner of the Peregrine Smith Poetry Prize), and <em>No Other Life</em> (winner of the Poetry Society of America's William Carlos Williams Award for best book of the year published by a university, literary, or independent press).<br/>
 <br/>
 Young will do a reading and Ninja Press&#8217;s Campbell will talk about the creation of <em>In Japan</em> on Tuesday, April 25, from 4 to 6 p.m. in Special Collections at McHenry Library on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Admission is free.<br/>
 <br/>
 Later that evening, Young will also appear at Bookshop Santa Cruz for a reading with all of the four poet laureates of Santa Cruz County. (In 2010, Young was named the first-ever Poet Laureate of Santa Cruz County&#8212;the other three are UCSC emeritus professor David Swanger, Ellen Bass, and Robert Sward). <br/>
 <br/>
 Here is a poem from <em>In Japan</em>:<br/>
 <br/>
 <em>All that&#8217;s left of the fabled residence is a teahouse on a tiny island in the center of a pond. The great hall must have been beautiful; the little house and the bridge beside it are lovely even now. Wisteria sways along a trellis that rises from the pond, and three turtles rest on a rock beside a slender crane. The water is marked with the dark shadows of cedar and pine, and enormous carp circle the pond endlessly, without knowing they&#8217;re in a pond, without knowing that they&#8217;re carp.</em><br/>

<p>Batalha leads the science investigation effort for NASA's Kepler Mission, searching for Earth-size planets beyond our solar system. Kepler aims to find out how common planets are in the "habitable zones" of other stars, where temperatures could allow liquid water to pool on the surface of the planet without freezing or evaporating. Working at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Batalha has been a leading figure of the mission since she joined the team in 1999.</p>
<p>"I'm so very proud of her, and very happy to see her get recognition for all the great work she's done at NASA as part of the Kepler mission. Natalie rocks!" said Steve Vogt, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics, who was Batalha's adviser when she was a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz, where she earned her Ph.D. in 1997.</p>
<p>Batalha is one of <a href="http://time.com/collection/2017-time-100/4742707/natalie-batalha-guillem-anglada-escude-michael-gillon/">three planet hunters featured on <em>Time's</em> list</a>. The others are Guillem Anglada-Escud&#233; of Queen Mary University of London, who has been a frequent collaborator with Vogt on recent planet discoveries; and Micha&#235;l Gillon of the University of Li&#232;ge in Belgium. Speaking of Batalha and Anglada-Escud&#233;, Vogt said, "You'd be hard-pressed to find two nicer and more capable people in the field."</p>
<p>Batalha is the first woman at NASA to receive the <em>Time</em> 100 designation. UCSC alumna Kathryn Sullivan was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/sullivan-time100.html">named to the list in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm honored to be part of the <em>Time</em> 100 and feel strongly that recognition belongs to the entire team of scientists and engineers who opened our eyes to the large number of potentially habitable worlds that populate the galaxy," Batalha said in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/kepler/kepler-scientist-on-time-magazine-most-influential-list">NASA statement</a>. "Searching for potentially habitable worlds makes one appreciate just how precious living worlds are. I hope that the discoveries from the Kepler spacecraft inspire people to learn more about other planets, and, in turn, make us love this one all the more."</p>
<p>Batalha earned her bachelor's degree in physics at UC Berkeley. She was a professor of physics and astronomy at San Jose State University for ten years before joining NASA. In 2011, she was awarded a NASA Public Service Medal for her vision in communicating Kepler science to the public and for outstanding leadership in coordinating the Kepler Science Team.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="92da59858072701721a2b70ed34d27e5"><name>athletics-referendum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Students to consider sustainable funding model for intercollegiate athletics</title><summary>The Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports is proposing a $38.50 -per-quarter fee, which if approved would provide the NCAA Division III program with approximately $1.1 million beginning in fall 2018. </summary><keywords>athletics, vote, referendum, funding</keywords><start-date>1492812000000</start-date><display-name>Athletics</display-name><path>/2017/04/athletics-referendum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/athletics-referendum</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1492817433635</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496259219104</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/basketball-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/basketball-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>basketball-400px.jpg</name><display-name>basketball-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>166968</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Volleyball huddle</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/athletics-thumb-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/athletics-thumb-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>athletics-thumb-80.jpg</name><display-name>athletics-thumb-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>18450</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>In February, the UC Santa Cruz men&#8217;s volleyball team earned a No. 2 ranking in NCAA Division III.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/soccer-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/soccer-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>soccer-500px.jpg</name><display-name>soccer-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>74474</file-size><width>504</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><p>UC Santa Cruz has 15 teams competing in the NCAA's Division III, including women's soccer.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz students will vote this spring on a fee that would provide the intercollegiate athletics program with a sustainable funding model and provide access to athletic-related activities to students who meet the Educational Opportunity Programs criteria.</p>
<p>The Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports is proposing a $38.50 -per-quarter fee, which if approved would provide the NCAA Division III program with approximately $1.1 million beginning in fall 2017. Approximately $160,000 would be generated to support athletic activities of student who meet EOP criteria, approximately 40 percent of the student body.</p>
<p>The referendum&#8217;s authors are trying to build support across campus for the fee. To date, they&#8217;ve received sponsorship from the Student Union Assembly and five colleges.</p>
<p>Students will <a href="http://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/">vote in May</a>. If approved, the fee would sunset in spring 2042.</p>
<p>Andrea Willer, executive director for the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports, said the new business model was developed in collaboration with students, faculty, staff, alumni, and campus supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;This collaboration enabled us to involve and engage the campus in ways we were not able to in the past,&#8221; Willer said. &#8220;This campuswide dialogue has not only informed and shaped the new business model but has also validated the multiple benefits intercollegiate athletics can bring to the greater campus community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The business model and fee proposal were developed by OPERS and Paul Simpson, an alumnus who played intercollegiate basketball and has a background in business. It comes as two committees&#8212;one commissioned by the Academic Senate and one of alumni and foundation board members&#8212;extensively researched the topic and issued separate reports. Both committees, among many recommendations, asked that the campus consider every reasonable measure to keep the intercollegiate athletics program, which started in 1981.</p>
<p>The current program consists of 15 men and women&#8217;s teams, which have about 300 students on the rosters. The average GPA well exceeds the campus average and the program boasts a 100 percent academic retention rate for the past five years. The teams have gone on to compete in championships and students have received scholar-athlete honors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The realities of financing collegiate athletic programs has changed tremendously over the years,&#8221; Simpson said. &#8220;This requires universities to innovate new business models that can generate significantly more revenue while controlling costs and limiting students&#8217; financial burden.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the business model we have developed will put the NCAA on sound footing, while only requiring a quarterly fee of $38.50.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite all the success on the field, the intercollegiate athletics program has been grappling with a deficit for the past several years, and campus leaders have asked that a sustainable funding model be developed that reduces the reliance on central campus funds. The program costs roughly $2.2 million with coach and trainer salaries (72 percent) and travel (16 percent) being the most significant expenses.</p>
<p>The new business model proposes the new fee; anticipates an ongoing campus contribution of $500,000 per year; and anticipates growing revenue from licensing and fundraising.</p>
<p>Last year, UC Santa Cruz students showed strong support for the intercollegiate athletics&#8217; program, with 63 percent of voting undergraduates signaling that they would be willing to establish a new fee. A record 43 percent of undergraduate students cast ballots.</p>
<p>The Academic Senate&#8217;s Special Committee on Athletics <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/senate-meetings/agendas-minutes/2016-2017/2017-March-8-Meeting/1854-SCA_Final_02_27_2017.pdf">submitted its report</a> at the March 8 meeting at the Stevenson Event Center.</p>
<p>"Our committee finds that the NCAA athletics program at UC Santa Cruz provides significant benefits to a wide range of student, campus, alumni, and off-campus communities and recommends that the university make every reasonable effort to maintain this program,&#8221; said Professor J. Xavier Prochaska, who chaired the committee. &#8220;We believe that, in addition to the student fee proposed in the referendum, the costs of the program must be shared by actively pursuing available funding from outside sources and by the central campus.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/athletics-poll.html</url><title>Athletics opinion poll wins student support</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a0d61bea8072701721a2b70eabcf63e0"><name>csa-discount</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Supported Agriculture season is about to begin</title><summary>Join the campus’s 2017 Community Support Agriculture program and get a fresh-picked box of organic produce from the UCSC Farm each week--at a 5 percent discount if you sign up by May 1.</summary><keywords>CASFS, CSA, community, agriculture, discount, sign up</keywords><start-date>1493017200000</start-date><display-name>CSA-Discount</display-name><path>/2017/04/csa-discount</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/csa-discount</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1493052036721</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1493136722422</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/csa_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/csa_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>csa_400.jpg</name><file-size>128626</file-size><width>400</width><height>534</height></image><image-alt>Photo of farmer harvesting produce for Community Supported Agriculture box</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/csa-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/csa-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>csa-thumb.jpg</name><file-size>4969</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of farmer harvesting produce for Community Supported Agriculture box</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Get a box of fresh-picked organic produce each week by signing up for the Farm's Community Supported Agriculture program.

In the United States, reported cases of Lyme disease, which is transmitted from wild animals to humans by tick bites, have tripled in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>A multitude of interacting factors are driving the increase in Lyme disease cases, but their relative importance remains unclear, according to Marm Kilpatrick, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. Nevertheless, he noted that there are a number of promising strategies for controlling the disease that have not been widely implemented.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick is lead author of a paper published April 24 in <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1722/20160117"><em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em></a> that examines the complex array of factors influencing the prevalence of Lyme disease and identifies the major gaps in understanding that must be filled to control this important disease.</p>
<p><strong>Areas of agreement</strong></p>
<p>Some of the unresolved issues are highly contentious, so Kilpatrick sought input for the paper from a wide range of Lyme disease researchers and developed a consensus on areas of agreement. "I wanted to address these big disputes. We've done so much work, let's identify what the gaps are and fill them so we can move on," he said.</p>
<p>A key missing piece in the Lyme disease puzzle is that scientists lack a detailed understanding of what limits populations of the <em>Ixodes</em> ticks that transmit the disease. Deer are the most important hosts for adult ticks, so the ticks are mostly absent from areas with no deer. But efforts to control ticks by reducing deer populations have had mixed results.</p>
<p>"If you eliminate deer completely, you can usually eliminate ticks. But is there a number to which you can reduce the deer population and have an impact on Lyme disease? We don't have a good answer right now. There have been experiments where the deer population was reduced by 50 percent or more without any measurable decrease in the tick population," Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>The <em>Borrelia</em> bacteria that cause Lyme disease are carried by small mammals such as mice and shrews, from which the ticks pick up the infection and transmit it to humans. It may be that in some areas, the most important drivers of tick abundance are the factors that control small mammal populations, including their food supply and predators, Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>"One group of scientists has argued that the major drivers are not so much deer populations but how we've changed the forest ecosystems and small mammal communities," he said. "Each group's research focuses on one part of the story, but in working on this paper we found that when they look at all the data together, they tend to agree on many things."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Multiple strains</strong></p>
<p>Another complicating factor is the existence of multiple strains of the bacteria, which appear to be associated with different small mammal hosts. The strains found in infected humans are often associated with a subset of tick hosts, Kilpatrick said. But the role of each host species, including mice, chipmunks, and squirrels, in sustaining tick populations and infecting them with strains of bacteria that cause disease in humans is still unclear.</p>
<p>"There are many factors causing variation in Lyme disease incidence, and this complexity of factors makes it challenging to make strong predictions about where the hotspots are going to be," Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>Pesticides that kill ticks (acaricides) are available and can be effective at reducing the numbers of ticks, but they are only useful on a small scale. In some regions, many infections are thought to be acquired from ticks in suburban backyards, but homeowners are often reluctant to spray pesticides in their yards. Other strategies targeting host animals with acaricides have shown promise in some trials. For example, deer can be lured to feeding stations where they rub against rollers that apply acaricide to their fur, which kills the ticks they carry. Another approach involves putting out treated cotton for mice to take back to their nests where it kills ticks.</p>
<p>A vaccine that was 80 percent effective in protecting people from getting the disease was available for several years, but was withdrawn from the market in 2002 due to lack of interest.</p>
<p>"We have a bunch of tools, but they have been underutilized," Kilpatrick said. "With ticks, the responsibility for protecting yourself is yours, unlike with mosquitoes where we have mosquito control agencies. It's an interesting contrast."</p>
<p>The paper appears in a special issue of <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</em> on the theme of "Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications."

Sinsheimer, an internationally acclaimed biologist and chancellor emeritus of the University of California, Santa Cruz, died on April 22 in Santa Barbara, California. He was 97.</p>
<p>As a scientist, Sinsheimer made significant breakthroughs in genetic research by artificially creating functional strands of DNA. He was also one of the first scientists to propose and seriously consider that a concerted effort be undertaken to sequence the human genome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Sinsheimer left an indelible mark on campus and in the greater scientific world,&#8221; UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;He was a tireless advocate for UC Santa Cruz and was widely respected by the campus community.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1985, Sinsheimer convened a group of eminent scientists at UC Santa Cruz to discuss the feasibility of sequencing the human genome. This historic workshop planted the idea for what eventually became the Human Genome Project, and UCSC scientists led by David Haussler ultimately played a crucial role in assembling the first human genome sequence in 2000.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer was also an outspoken advocate of science's accountability to society. As early as the mid-1960s, he came to realize that advances in genetics would have profound social consequences. When recombinant DNA technology arose in the 1970s, giving scientists the ability to splice together genetic material from different organisms, he used his position as an acknowledged authority in the field to warn of potential hazards. And when he proposed sequencing the human genome, he hoped at the same time to focus attention on the social and ethical concerns such a project would inevitably raise.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer served as chancellor of UC Santa Cruz from 1977 to 1987. He oversaw growth in academic programs and student enrollments at the campus during an era of tight educational budgets. A new undergraduate major in computer engineering was established, and graduate enrollments doubled from 350 to 700. New graduate programs and important new research activities were developed during his tenure, including major expansions in linguistics and high-energy physics and new research programs in seismology, agroecology, and applied economics. Sinsheimer was also involved in writing a new academic plan for the campus.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer's distinguished career as a teacher and administrator included nine years as chairman of the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology. After his tenure at UC Santa Cruz, Sinsheimer joined the faculty at UC Santa Barbara as a professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology. He retired in 1990, but remained active in laboratory research for many years.</p>
<p>In 2001, Sinsheimer received the University of California's Presidential Medal for his contributions to knowledge and to higher education. Then-UC President Richard C. Atkinson presented the medal at a ceremony during the UCSC Human Genome Symposium, noting the role Sinsheimer played in initiating the Human Genome Project, his achievements as a biologist, and his leadership of the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer was born in Washington, D.C., and attended high school in Chicago. In 1936, at the age of 16, he enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), intending to become a chemical engineer. Instead, he joined a new 5-year program leading to a combined S.B. and S.M. degree in quantitative biology and biological engineering, graduating in 1941. His intention to pursue graduate studies in biochemistry was interrupted by World War II, during which time he worked on aircraft radar as a staff member of the MIT Radiation Laboratory. Following the war he enrolled in the fledgling biophysics graduate program at MIT, earning his Ph.D. in 1949.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer taught briefly at MIT before moving to Iowa State College in 1949, where he was a professor of biophysics. In 1957, he accepted the post of professor of biophysics at Caltech, where he worked for the next 20 years before accepting the position of chancellor at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Sinsheimer received numerous awards and honors for his achievements. He was named California Scientist of the Year in 1968. He authored some 200 publications in his various areas of research interest, as well as an autobiography, <em>The Strands of a Life: The Science of DNA and the Art of Education</em>, published in 1994.</p>
<p>Sinsheimer was pre-deceased by his wife of 34 years, Karen Keeton Sinsheimer, who died in 2015. He is survived by three children from his former marriage to Joan Hirsh&#8212;Roger Sinsheimer, Lois Wickstrom, and Kathy Sinsheimer; as well as five granddaughters&#8212;Erica Brand,&#160;Eileen Smith,&#160;Rachel Vandagriff,&#160;Jessica Sinsheimer, and&#160;Corinne Vandagriff&#8212;and four great-grandchildren, Kayla Brand,&#160;Allison Brand,&#160;Cassandra Smith, and&#160;Peyton Smith.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a628aadb8072701721a2b70e587e7dcf"><name>scoping-land-use</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Input sought on environmental review of proposed land-use change</title><start-date>1493136000000</start-date><display-name>Land use</display-name><path>/2017/04/scoping-land-use</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/scoping-land-use</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1493141333378</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1493156616867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In support of offering more housing for UC Santa Cruz students, the campus is looking at changing the land-use designation for 14 acres on the west side of campus.</p>
<p>The land, between Family Student Housing and Porter College, is designated Campus Resource Land and needs to be changed to Colleges and Student Housing to be part of the student housing initiative. As part of the process, the campus is preparing an environmental impact report to analyze the potential impacts of a land-use change.</p>
<p>The first step is to develop a scope for the environmental review, and the campus is seeking input into what needs to be evaluated as part of the environmental impact report.</p>

<p>Jinnah is one of 35 winners selected from a field of nearly 200 nominees who were put forward by their home institutions. Jinnah's project was submitted by Chancellor George Blumenthal, who described Jinnah as "arguably one of the most qualified scholars to take on a study of the contentious topic of international regulation of climate geo-engineering."</p>
<p>Andrew Carnegie Fellows receive support that allows them to focus on research and writing projects that address pressing issues. Jinnah was awarded $200,000 to fund her proposal, "Global Governance of Climate (Geo)Engineering," which will address the political challenges surrounding governance of emerging technologies designed to address climate change. Recipients were announced in a full-page ad in the New York Times today (April 26).</p>
<p>Jinnah specializes in global environmental politics and international institutions. She is the author of <em>Post-Treaty Politics: Secretariat Influence in Global Environmental Governance</em> (MIT Press), which received the 2016 Harold and Margaret Sprout Award from the International Studies Association for the best book in international environmental affairs. She is also co-editor of <em>New Earth Politics: Essays from the Anthropocene</em> (MIT Press 2017).</p>
<p>As part of her fellowship, Jinnah will focus on global governance for the suite of emerging technologies known as climate engineering, or simply geoengineering. Climate engineering has long been a taboo topic in climate science and policy circles, with many arguing it would distract attention away from greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation strategies. Recently, however, the idea has gained traction in global politics&#8212;in, for example, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change references to negative emission technologies, and the Paris Agreement&#8217;s call for a net negative carbon economy by mid-century.</p>
<p>Jinnah argues that governance remains insufficient to manage the substantial uncertainties surrounding the efficacy and possible broader social impacts of these technologies. Without advocating for the actual use of climate engineering, Jinnah argues that near-term governance is needed to enable society to make informed determinations about any future use&#8212;or rejection&#8212;of climate engineering technologies for addressing climate change.</p>
<p>Fellowship recipients were announced by the philanthropic foundation Carnegie Corporation of New York, which is dedicated to advancing knowledge and understanding. Nominations were reviewed by one or more of 33 anonymous evaluators; final selections were made by a 16-member committee of distinguished scholars that includes 10 current or former university presidents.</p>
<p>"The Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program is designed to support scholarship that brings fresh perspectives from the social sciences and humanities to the social, political, and economic problems facing the United States and the world today," said Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation of New York.</p>
<p>Jinnah joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in July 2016. She came to the campus from American University's School of International Service. She earned her Ph.D. in environmental science, policy, and management from UC Berkeley and was a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University&#8217;s Watson Institute for International Studies.<br/>

 <br/>
 "We have had no problem at all finding high-school aged LGBTQ youth to participate in the research, including transgender youth," said Hammack. <br/>
 <br/>
 Hammack is reaching out to LGBTQ youth in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley to understand how local community contexts can exacerbate or ameliorate stressors associated with being LGBTQ.<br/>
 <br/>
 The willingness of adolescents to participate is an encouraging sign, said Hammack. <br/>
 <br/>
 "What I'm seeing as a researcher and a teacher is a quiet&#8212;or not so quiet&#8212;gender and sexual revolution taking place among young people, who are constantly questioning sexual identity labels and categories," he said. "Young people are engaging with this. It's happening everywhere, but the research hasn't documented the nature of this revolution."<br/>
 <br/>
 <a href="https://pcilab.ucsc.edu/">Hammack</a>, an associate professor of psychology, was drawn to the question of community impact on well-being when he saw maps of Prop. 8 voting patterns after the 2008 passage of the ban on gay marriage. The Golden State was split in two, he said. <br/>
 <br/>
 "In the Central Valley, which is overwhelmingly conservative, Prop. 8 passed with more than 70 percent support, while the Bay Area was the exact opposite," said Hammack. How does growing up in a supportive&#8212;or hostile&#8212;community impact LGBTQ youth, he wondered.<br/>
 <br/>
 There was another reason to include Central Valley youth in the study: The scholarly literature on LGBTQ youth focuses largely on urban environments, according to Hammack. "The research picture of today's gay youth is omitting voices, especially those growing up in rural areas," said Hammack, whose results will add depth and dimension to the literature. <br/>
 <br/>
 Half of the youth participating in Hammack's study live in five counties in the Central Valley, and half live in counties in the San Francisco Bay Area (San Francisco was excluded as an "outlier"). The project includes an analysis of publicly available data, including political party affiliation, as well as a survey of more than 300 LGBTQ high school students, and in-depth, in-person interviews with adolescents and adult community leaders. <br/>
 <br/>
 Hammack, who launched the five-year investigation with support from a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/05/hammack-grant.html">W. T. Grant Scholar Award</a>, was just named a <a href="https://casbs.stanford.edu/casbs-announces-2017-18-fellows">2017-18 fellow</a> of the <a href="https://casbs.stanford.edu/">Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University</a>, which will enable him to spend the next year analyzing data and writing up his results. <br/>
 <br/>
 The CASBS fellowship, established in 1954, supports scholars who are studying contemporary problems and contributing to evidence-based policy and solutions. Hammack is one of 37 fellows selected for the coming academic year.<br/>
 <br/>
 "Some people say 'We have the internet now, that makes it all good,' but I think the community environment is central to well-being," said Hammack.<br/>
 <br/>
 He does suspect the internet is influential in one area: speeding the "quiet revolution" in sexual identity Hammack is seeing.<br/>
 <br/>
 "Young people are questioning categories constantly, and identity labels like 'lesbian,' 'gay,' and 'bi,' are the labels of yesterday," he said. <br/>
 <br/>
 It's too early to draw conclusions from the data, but Hammack is gratified by the willingness of young people to participate, particularly transgender youth. "Studies of trans youth are almost non-existent," said Hammack. "Surprisingly, the most challenging group to recruit is the most over-represented in the adult literature: cisgender gay males."<br/>
 <br/>
 The combination of qualitative and quantitative components will be illuminating. "We are listening to them," he said. "We want to be ahead of this. We are not just asking what has been asked before."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/hammack-marriage-ruling.html</url><title>Hammack calls same sex marriage ruling a "sea change"</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="abfda8a38072701721a2b70ef8ac6605"><name>watsonville-high-stem-visit-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Inspiring young students to branch into STEM</title><summary>This spring, an enterprising group of Watsonville High School students put on lab coats and safety goggles and got a behind-the-scenes look at the labs of UC Santa Cruz's Science Hill. </summary><start-date>1493239140000</start-date><display-name>stem-visit-watsonville-high-science-hill</display-name><path>/2017/04/watsonville-high-stem-visit-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/watsonville-high-stem-visit-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1493239177986</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1493239577496</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/Watsonville High.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/Watsonville High.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Watsonville High.jpg</name><display-name>Watsonville High.jpg</display-name><file-size>52330</file-size><width>263</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/Watsonvillehighthumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/Watsonvillehighthumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Watsonvillehighthumb.jpg</name><display-name>Watsonvillehighthumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16629</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The visiting Watsonville High School students enjoyed putting on their lab coats and goggles and getting a first-hand glimpse of UC Santa Cruz laboratories.

<p>A few of them giggled nervously as they looked at each other, all dressed up like scientists. Many took group selfies in their science garb. They could barely contain their excitement as they stomped down an echoing stairwell and descended into the labs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cool huh?&#8221; said one student as he peered through a microscope, examining some retinal cells from human eyes. &#8220;How did you get these things?&#8221; he marveled. &#8220;Did you scrape them off someone&#8217;s eyeball?&#8221; (The answer from a lab assistant was, &#8220;Yes, we did.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Other students chuckled at some of the quirky, homey touches that warmed up the austere atmosphere of some laboratories, including a yellow Post-It note saying &#8220;WHERE&#8217;S THE COFFEE?,&#8221; and a baby Jesus statuette hiding inside a piece of equipment that measures concentrations of cells.&#160; Those warm, humanizing touches made the labs seem more welcoming and familiar.&#160;</p>
<p>The visit was part of an ongoing outreach effort by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s STEM Diversity Programs, led by director Yuliana Ortega.&#160; Current STEM Diversity students, science faculty, and staff members teamed up to visit Watsonville high school classrooms and inspire students from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the sciences.&#160;</p>
<p>The STEM Diversity Office funded the visit with the help of the local offices of SACNAS, an organization dedicated to fostering the success of Chicano/Hispanic and Native American scientists, encouraging and helping them to attain advanced degrees, careers, and positions of leadership in STEM careers.</p>
<p>Doug Kellogg, a professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, summed up the theme of the visit: "We wanted to let students know that science is exciting and rewarding, and that if you dream of becoming a scientist, you can and should follow your dream."</p>
<p><strong>Meeting mentors</strong></p>
<p>That message hit home, especially when the students had a chance to meet researchers who grew up alongside them in Watsonville, including Veronica Urabe, a Ph.D. student in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology who is studying a complex molecular machine known as the spliceosome, which edits the information translated from the genome.</p>
<p>Urabe, 29, did not have role models in the sciences early on, but she had the talent and passion&#8212;and she soon found mentors who supported her and led her to enroll at UC Santa Cruz. Her father, a grocery clerk, and her mother, a social worker, recognized right away that she had a passion for science.&#160; Even as a child, she would be cutting up a chicken and startling her parents by saying, &#8220;Oh, look - this is a capillary!&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking back, Urabe can see that she was a trailblazer. "I didn&#8217;t really know this was a career path, but I have made it my own, and gone after what I want. There has always been this innate kind of driver, pulling me toward this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urabe found her calling after graduating from Watsonville High School in 2005. While attending Cabrillo College, she was accepted into the UC Santa Cruz ACCESS Summer Research Institute, an intensive eight-week introduction to research methods and tools in the biomedical sciences. &#160;Selected participants work with UC Santa Cruz faculty mentors on a research project in their field of interest.&#160; At Cabrillo College and UC Santa Cruz, Urabe found the mentors who encouraged her love and science and led her to pursue a Ph.D. degree.</p>
<p><strong>Fired up about the sciences</strong></p>
<p>The students looked wide-eyed at certain points of the tour, but they had an easy rapport with their tour guides. This was not surprising; they had met some of those researchers and faculty members before.</p>
<p>Science faculty, as well as undergraduate and graduate students from the STEM program, visited Watsonville High School in December to fire them up about the sciences.&#160; Now this self-selecting group of science-minded high school students was touring UC Santa Cruz labs and taking in panel discussions and presentations from Admissions and Financial Aid.</p>
<p>Mauricio Medrano, 17, of Watsonville High School, was very impressed by what he saw during the tour and panel talks. &#8220;Probably the most striking thing is the fact that you have so many different areas to study in each field,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that is amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of his parents are in agriculture. &#8220;They&#8217;re farmers; I didn&#8217;t really get into any STEM fields until I got to high school,&#8221; said Medrano, who is now taking AP biology.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the visit was a galvanizing talk by Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;We need all of your brilliance&#8221; in the sciences, he said.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz described himself to the students, intriguingly, as "a sort of stellar mortician. I study the death of stars. I can tell you where the oxygen we breathe comes from, and the iron in your blood. You know most of these elements were formed in stars &#8230; Chemically, we are much closer to each other than we are genetically. Every single one of our atoms is basically encoded with the history of the universe."</p>
<p>The students broke out in knowing smiles when they learned that Ramirez-Ruiz hails from Mexico, and that he went to Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico with 100,000 other students&#8212;a thousand of them in his physics major alone. &#8220;I am extremely interested in promoting science within the Latino community,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Why science?</strong></p>
<p>Why should they pursue such careers? For one thing, he said, science is the key to learning where we come from and, literally, &#8220;what we are made of.&#8221; Another goal is protecting the planet. But, from a practical standpoint, those who pursue science careers can earn five times more than those who don&#8217;t, he also noted. &#8220;We need a lot of talented people to get into the sciences,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Think of UC Santa Cruz as your home university.&#8221;</p>
<p>He emphasized that he and other science faculty would make themselves accessible to interested students. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us directly.&#8221; He also mentioned summer programs geared for outstanding students interested in the sciences. &#8220;I am very excited to see all of you here visiting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is just the beginning of your journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The message to the intrigued young students was clear: there is more than just one pathway to careers in the sciences. Speaker after speaker illustrated that point, including <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2017/04/goldwater-scholar.html">Andrea Antoni,</a> who went from being a single mom supporting herself as a sandwich maker at Togo&#8217;s to becoming a physics researcher at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Antoni, an undergraduate majoring in physics, was recently named a 2017&#160;Goldwater Scholar by the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation. The Goldwater Scholarschip is a prestigious national competition for undergraduates studying math, science, and engineering.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is totally amazing that every day I get to come here,&#8221; Antoni said. &#8220;Instead of arguing with customers about a five-dollar burrito, I get to challenge this huge creative part of myself that was starving before&#8212;and people are paying me.</p>

In these vast expanses between the galaxies, a diffuse haze of hydrogen gas left over from the Big Bang is spread so thin there's only one atom per cubic meter. On the largest scales, this diffuse material is arranged in a vast network of filamentary structures known as the &#8220;cosmic web,&#8221; its tangled strands spanning billions of light years and accounting for the majority of atoms in the Universe.</p>
<p>Now a team of astronomers including J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has made the first measurements of small-scale ripples in this primeval hydrogen gas. Although the regions of cosmic web they studied lie nearly 11 billion light years away, they were able to measure variations in its structure on scales a 100,000 times smaller, comparable to the size of a single galaxy. The researchers presented their findings in a paper published April 27 in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/418.full"><em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>Intergalactic gas is so tenuous that it emits no light of its own. Instead astronomers study it indirectly, by observing how it selectively absorbs the light coming from faraway sources known as quasars. Quasars constitute a brief hyper-luminous phase of the galactic life-cycle, powered by the infall of matter onto a galaxy's central supermassive black hole. They thus act like cosmic lighthouses&#8212;bright, distant beacons that allow astronomers to study intergalactic atoms residing between the quasars location and Earth.</p>
<p>Because these hyper-luminous episodes last only a tiny fraction of a galaxy&#8217;s lifetime, quasars are correspondingly rare on the sky, and are typically separated by hundreds of millions of light years from each other. In order to probe the cosmic web on much smaller scales, the astronomers exploited a fortuitous cosmic coincidence: they identified exceedingly rare pairs of quasars, right next to each other on the sky, and measured subtle differences in the absorption of intergalactic atoms measured along the two sightlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest challenges was developing the mathematical and statistical tools to quantify the tiny differences we measure in this new kind of data,&#8221; said Alberto Rorai, a post-doctoral researcher at Cambridge university and lead author of the study. Rorai developed these tools as part of the research for his doctoral degree, and applied his tools to spectra of quasars obtained by the team on the largest telescopes in the world, including the 10-meter Keck telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</p>
<p>The astronomers compared their measurements to supercomputer models that simulate the formation of cosmic structures from the Big Bang to the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;The input to our simulations are the laws of physics and the output is an artificial universe which can be directly compared to astronomical data. I was delighted to see that these new measurements agree with the well-established paradigm for how cosmic structures form,&#8221; said Jose O&#241;orbe, a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, who led the supercomputer simulation effort. On a single laptop, these complex calculations would have required almost a thousand years to complete, but modern supercomputers enabled the researchers to carry them out in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;One reason why these small-scale fluctuations are so interesting is that they encode information about the temperature of gas in the cosmic web just a few billion years after the Big Bang,&#8221; said Joseph Hennawi, a professor of physics at UC Santa Barbara who led the search for quasar pairs.</p>
<p>Astronomers believe that the matter in the universe went through phase transitions billions of years ago, which dramatically changed its temperature. These phase transitions, known as cosmic reionization, occurred when the collective ultraviolet glow of all stars and quasars in the universe became intense enough to strip electrons off of the atoms in intergalactic space. How and when reionization occurred is one of the biggest open questions in the field of cosmology, and these new measurements provide important clues that will help narrate this chapter of the history of the universe.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b121dcff8072701721a2b70e3aafae87"><name>uc-entrepreneurs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC entrepreneurs invited to meet with venture capitalists</title><summary>UC entrepreneurs will meet with leading venture capitalists next month at a special lunch hosted by UC President Janet Napolitano.</summary><keywords>Robin Hunicke, Brian Vallelunga, entrepreneurship</keywords><start-date>1493276400000</start-date><display-name>UC entrepreneurs invited to meet with venture capitalists</display-name><path>/2017/04/uc-entrepreneurs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/uc-entrepreneurs</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1493325436820</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1493325609348</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/robin-hunicke-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/robin-hunicke-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>robin-hunicke-400.jpg</name><display-name>robin-hunicke-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>60535</file-size><width>400</width><height>266</height></image><image-alt>Robin Hunicke</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/robin-hunicke-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/robin-hunicke-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>robin-hunicke-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>robin-hunicke-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16385</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Robin Hunicke</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Robin Hunicke</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Robin Hunicke, director of the Art &amp; Design: Games &amp; Playable Media program at UC Santa Cruz, and computer science student Brian Vallelunga are among 19 UC entrepreneurs who will get a chance to meet and pitch some of Silicon Valley&#8217;s leading venture capitalists next month at a special lunch hosted by UC President Janet Napolitano and Christine Gulbranson, UC&#8217;s senior vice president of innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The entrepreneurs were chosen randomly from more than 340 students, faculty, and staff who recorded personal videos from their offices, labs, dorms, and video recording parties this past winter and submitted them to the <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/entrepreneurs">&#8220;I am a UC Entrepreneur&#8221; campaign</a>.</p>

<p>On May 5, the group will lunch with Napolitano, Gulbranson and VC leaders Brook Byers, of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB); Josh Green, of Mohr Davidow Ventures; and Brendon Kim, of Samsung NEXT.</p>
<p>&#8220;These 19 entrepreneurs represent the talent, diversity and passion that makes UC an entrepreneurial powerhouse,&#8221; Gulbranson said. &#8220;The &#8216;I am a UC Entrepreneur&#8217; campaign showcases their unique stories, as well as the breadth and depth of UC&#8217;s entrepreneurial efforts across more than two dozen incubators and accelerators across the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gulbranson encouraged everyone to keep sharing their inspiring stories on the &#8220;I am a UC Entrepreneur&#8221; campaign site (<a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/entrepreneurs">www.universityofcalifornia.edu/entrepreneurs</a>). Students, faculty, staff, and postdocs who submit a 30-second video sharing what makes them an entrepreneur will still receive a &#8220;UC Entrepreneur&#8221; T-shirt for sharing their stories.</p>

She is about to publish a paper on the topic, is headed to Harvard for a summer research program, has a 3.7 GPA, and plans to go to graduate school.</p>
<p>But a decision her parents made to bring Amy to the U.S. at the age of 4 leaves her with worries and obstacles many other students don&#8217;t face.</p>
<p>Amy (not her real name) is undocumented, which means she is ineligible for some scholarships, may be hampered in her graduate studies because she isn&#8217;t allowed to get federal research funds, and, in the current political climate, lives with an undercurrent of anxiety that her family could be deported.</p>
<p>But thanks to more than a half-dozen programs at UC Santa Cruz, Amy and approximately 400 other undocumented students on campus have been able not only to survive, but to thrive.</p>
<p>The programs&#8212;funded by the University of California and some private donations&#8212;provide counseling, internships, legal help, support groups, an extended orientation program, and even a lending library of 3,000 textbooks for undocumented students to borrow. The campus&#8217;s Educational Opportunity Programs office (EOP) carries out these programs, which were developed by and, now, implemented by, students and counselors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is it critical to have these services?&#8221; says Pablo Reguer&#237;n (Oakes &#8217;94, Latin American and Latino studies), who is assistant vice provost for student success at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Because undocumented students represent an enormous asset in terms of their intellectual, academic, and human capital for the state. Aside from these benefits, this is a matter of our own humanity and social justice.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Changing policies</h3>
<p>The history of undocumented students at UC campuses is a checkered one. Before 1991, undocumented students were allowed to pay in-state tuition at UC institutions provided they could prove they had lived in the state for a year and a day and planned to make California their home. Then, in 1990, an employee at the UCLA Office of the Registrar sued, saying he was forced to quit because he could not follow those rules. The employee won an injunction and soon undocumented students were being charged out-of-state tuition rates, which basically barred them from a UC education.</p>
<p>A 2001 state law, AB 540, changed the rule so that undocumented students could again pay in-state fees. More state laws, passed in 2011, allowed these students to receive some state financial aid. Finally, in 2012, President Barack Obama signed an executive order dubbed DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which prevented young people who were brought to this country as children from being deported while they were in school.</p>
<p>College seemed within reach for more undocumented students until the election of Donald Trump, who had called for a hard line on immigration policy. That prompted UC President Janet Napolitano, in November 2016, to not only reiterate the UC system&#8217;s support of undocumented students and but also allocate money for undocumented student programs. UC Santa Cruz will receive $275,000 in each of the next three years.</p>
<h3>Harvesting talent</h3>
<p>Santa Cruz programs funded by this money, along with private donations, include free legal services for students and their families, peer counseling, support groups, a textbook lending library that hands out about 650 textbooks each quarter, and an intense five-day orientation program for undocumented students. Besides learning how to navigate the wooded campus and schedule classes, the orientation gives undocumented students information on renewing their DACA status, negotiating with landlords who may be averse to renting to undocumented students, budgeting, getting emotional support, and finding financial aid, among other subjects.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the UC Santa Cruz Career Center also offers an internship program available to undocumented students through the Professional Career Development Program (PCDP). These internships are especially important for undocumented students, who may come from low-income families and find themselves facing a funding gap of $7,000 to $9,000 a year, according to Reguer&#237;n.</p>
<p>For five undocumented members of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s STEM Diversity Program this year, the PCDP program means an opportunity to not only do hands-on research in fields like neurodegenerative diseases and gene expression but also receive a stipend for their work, according to Yulianna Ortega (Merrill &#8217;05, biology and Latin American and Latino studies), director of the STEM Diversity Program. Two other undocumented STEM students are working on administrative projects.</p>
<p>In addition, a program called Lamat, funded by philanthropist Julie Packard (Crown '74, biology; M.A. '78) allows community college students, including those who are undocumented, to be part of a summer research session in astrophysics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see these efforts as an opportunity, especially in the sciences, to find and harvest the remarkable talent we have in these communities,&#8221; says UC Santa Cruz Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz.</p>
<h3>Have potential, need opportunity</h3>
<p>While UC Santa Cruz sometimes lost capable students from wealthier schools to institutions like Harvard, Stanford, and Princeton, Ramirez-Ruiz says, he and others have been able to attract a pool of equally talented students, many undocumented, who are ready to bring their differing viewpoints in order to find solutions to complex astrophysical problems that are often more innovative and creative.</p>
<p>The students attacked problems with vigor and were quick to think on their feet, Ramirez-Ruiz says, but their status in society often made them feel unwelcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;They knew, in order to stand out, they had to do better than everyone else because of the excessive resistance they are constantly confronting,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz says.</p>
<p>Undocumented students from UC Santa Cruz have not only gone on to graduate school, but also a number are working in fields like education, biotechnology, public health, and in the nonprofit sector.</p>
<p>Says Ortega: &#8220;These students have so much potential. They just need the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, the talent is already here, already contributing positively to society, and some of these students are just brilliant,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz says. &#8220;There is a clear message from society to them that they are second class and that they don&#8217;t belong here. But despite this unyielding defiance, the level of determination shown by these students is basically unmatched. We need to give them an opportunity because in terms of market value, they are an investment that will give you the highest return.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal agrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is committed to supporting these hard-working, talented students who continue to make valuable contributions to the campus and to their fields of study,&#8221; Blumenthal says.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b5fc80aa8072701721a2b70edbcde053"><name>hesterman</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From founding farmer to champion of the fair food movement</title><summary>Oran Hesterman, author of Fair Food: Growing a Healthy, Sustainable Food System for All and president and founder of Fair Food Network, talks about his roots on the UCSC Farm.</summary><keywords>hesterman, farm, casfs, agroecology, food, apprenticeship</keywords><start-date>1493190000000</start-date><display-name>hesterman-casfs</display-name><path>/2017/04/hesterman</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/hesterman</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1493406874222</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1493408997639</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/hesterman.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/hesterman.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hesterman.jpg</name><file-size>56693</file-size><width>320</width><height>480</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Oran Hesterman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/hesterman_thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/hesterman_thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hesterman_thumb.jpg</name><file-size>7336</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Oran Hesterman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Oran Hesterman is a champion of low-income families, helping them get access to fresh, healthy food.

(Photo by Leonard Herzstein)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Oran Hesterman credits his experiences at the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden with setting him on his life’s journey</article-subhead><article-text><p>In the spring of 1971, a student from the Aesthetic Studies program at UC Santa Cruz took a class that would change the course of his life. The college freshman enrolled in &#8220;The Built Environment,&#8221; a seminar taught by philosophy and religious studies professor <a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/farmgarden">Paul Lee</a> who in 1967 helped start the 3-acre Student Garden Project (now the Alan Chadwick Garden).</p>
<p>That student was Oran Hesterman, author of the influential book Fair Food: Growing a Healthy, Sustainable Food System for All (Public Affairs, 2011) and president and founder of <a href="https://fairfoodnetwork.org/">Fair Food Network</a>, the organization behind what is today a national model for helping low-income families enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP; formerly food stamps) bring home more healthy food, while supporting American farmers.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivating a changemaker</strong></p>
<p>Before Hesterman championed a healthy and equitable food system, he was a strappy art student turned farmer in Santa Cruz, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t stay away, &#8221; Hesterman remembers about the space he would spend several years transforming into a working farm.</p>
<p>Soon, all of Hesterman&#8217;s spare time was spent at the farm. By his junior year, he dropped out of school to devote himself full-time to what he calls an &#8220;experiment&#8221; in both communal living and organic farming.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were eighteen of us living in teepees,&#8221; Hesterman recalls. This volunteer group, dubbed the &#8220;home farmers,&#8221; helped develop many of the garden beds, orchards, and basic infrastructure of what today is the 30-acre UCSC Farm. Their work also helped lay the foundation for today&#8217;s <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship/index.html">Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture</a>, a full-time training program offered annually through UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).</p>
<p>&#8220;We were completely disconnected from the electricity grid,&#8221; he says about life on the farm in the early 1970s. The group was completely self-sufficient. They grew all their own food and bartered the produce they farmed for cheese, grains, and store credit at local health food stores.<br/>
 &#8220;The farm showed me it was possible to imagine a different way of feeding ourselves,&#8221; says Hesterman.</p>
<p>At the time local businesses were asking for alfalfa sprouts and Hesterman, along with some of his farming cohort, began growing sprouts. Over the next few years, many of the volunteers left the farm and started ventures of their own. But Hesterman stayed behind and expanded sprout production into a full-fledged business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Cruz was the early hub of the natural food scene,&#8221; says Hesterman. His alfalfa sprout business boomed and become one of the largest in the country.</p>
<p><strong>From the margins to the mainstream</strong></p>
<p>But what is dubbed a food movement now was not considered that then, he shares.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were seen as the fringe and in the margin. We were dismissed by more traditional agricultural interests,&#8221; he says about trying to break into the food business.</p>
<p>Realizing his sprout business needed more expertise, Hesterman decided to return to school&#8212;this time as a plant scientist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was entranced by the process of photosynthesis,&#8221; says Hesterman. He enrolled in biology and math classes at Cabrillo College and in 1977 transferred to UC Davis to complete his undergraduate and M.S. degrees. He continued his studies at the University of Minnesota where he earned a Ph.D. in agronomy and plant genetics. There his research led to groundbreaking work on using alfalfa to replenish soil nitrogen without chemical fertilizers.</p>
<p><strong>Investing in sustainable and organic food systems</strong></p>
<p>Hesterman eventually landed a professorship at Michigan State University, where he taught for 12 years. After a sabbatical helping the Michigan-based W.K. Kellogg Foundation define what an agriculture investment portfolio could look like, Hesterman was invited to join the foundation as an officer of this newly launched program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to find ways to unleash both philanthropic and investment capital to organizations and businesses that support the products people are demanding,&#8221; says Hesterman, who is committed to sustainable and equitable food systems.</p>
<p>During his tenure at the Kellogg Foundation, where he eventually led the Integrated Farming Systems and Food &amp; Society programs, Hesterman helped seed the local food movement with more than $200 million in investments, including funding a pilot project in Maryland that boosted the value of SNAP benefits (also known as EBT, or food stamps) when used at farmers&#8217; markets.</p>
<p>After more than a decade as a funder fueling nonprofit innovation and experimentation, Hesterman struck out to launch his own organization. In 2009, the Fair Food Network was born.</p>
<p>Building off the Maryland pilot Hesterman had supported at the Kellogg Foundation, Fair Food Network launched &#8220;<a href="http://www.doubleupfoodbucks.org/">Double Up Food Bucks</a>,&#8221; an initiative that doubles SNAP benefits when spent at local farmers&#8217; markets. With more credit to spend on fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables, low-income families can eat healthier while supporting growers in the region and local food economies. Double Up&#8217;s strong track record in Michigan helped inspire a new $100 million grants program established in the 2014 Farm Bill, which is supporting organizations nationwide to implement these types of produce incentive programs. Double Up has become a statewide success story in Michigan, operating in more than 200 sites across the state. It&#8217;s also become a model for more than 20 states with families and farmers benefitting from local Double Up programs at hundreds of farmers&#8217; markets and grocery and corner stores across the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an example of how innovation at the community level can influence policy,&#8221; says Hesterman about the importance of local activism.</p>
<p><strong>Back to his roots</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We are now at a point where successful models exist,&#8221; Hesterman adds about changes in the food systems.</p>
<p>And it all goes back to the UCSC Farm and Garden. What was once an experiment is now a movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that we call it a movement is a milestone,&#8221; says Hesterman about how the market has changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The farm was really the early seeds of innovation,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Now everywhere I go, I run across people whose roots go back to the apprenticeship program.&#8221;</p>
<p>While tent cabins have replaced tepees for the farmers in training, the immersive environment that Hesterman pioneered is still at the heart of the Apprenticeship program. And some apprentices are still growing sprouts.</p>

Organizers are calling for a range of actions on campus and in the nearby area. This is an advisory to be prepared and to stay informed.</p>
<p>At this time it is unknown how these activities will impact our campus; however, as we have seen in the past, protesters may try to impede vehicular access to campus, march around campus and through buildings, occupy areas, and disrupt services. Supervisors and managers should discuss contingency plans with staff ahead of Monday, May 1. When appropriate, contingency plans may include telecommuting and alternate work site arrangements.</p>
<p>Instructors are strongly encouraged to speak with their department chair regarding contingency plans should classroom access be impacted. Additionally, employees may leave their workspace if they do not feel safe, be that because of a demonstration, building occupation, or other major incident. And of course, in any situation of imminent danger, people should call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 911.</p>
<p>Information about actual impacts will be posted Monday on the campus homepage, which will have a ribbon at the top to provide quick access to current status information.</p>
<p>Please check the campus homepage or this page for information about transportation, dining, and other services that could be impacted.</p>
<p>In addition to updating the homepage as information warrants, the Public Affairs Office will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording information on the campus's communications hotline, 459-INFO (831-459-4636).</li>
<li>Relaying information on a regular basis to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast.</li>
<li>Sharing information about significant disruptions via Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/ucsc">twitter.com/ucsc</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please check the campus homepage or 459-INFO before coming to campus May 1, and please continue to monitor them throughout the day.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c61789f38072701702deaeb02a740c91"><name>ucsc-alumni-weekend-feature-story-2017</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Weekend 2017: Glorious weather, vibrant events bring Slugs home</title><summary>Revelers took a Fun Run, got a crash course in activism, rekindled old friendships, let their hair down, and paid tribute to Sammy the Slug at UC Santa Cruz Alumni Weekend 2017. </summary><start-date>1493680380000</start-date><display-name>alumni weekend uc santa cruz 2017</display-name><path>/2017/04/ucsc-alumni-weekend-feature-story-2017</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/ucsc-alumni-weekend-feature-story-2017</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1493677081686</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1493759883348</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed><iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/320558054&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe></embed><width/><caption><span>Alumni had touching and funny stories to tell during Alumni Weekend&#8212;take a listen to these podcasts from interviews by student intern Loukas Stelyn.&#160;</span></caption></video><video><embed><iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/320558774&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe></embed><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/Alum-kidzone.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/Alum-kidzone.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Alum-kidzone.jpg</name><display-name>Alum-kidzone.jpg</display-name><file-size>54553</file-size><width>350</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/04/images/alum-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/04/images/alum-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alum-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alum-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16885</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Little Slugs had a chance to raise a ruckus at the annual Banana Slug Kid Zone.

One moment, a returning Banana Slug might be sipping a beer at the Kick-Off Party/Beer Garden event at the Cocoanut Grove while sharing hilarious, off-color stories about early-1970s-era UC Santa Cruz while Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s &#8220;Boat Drinks&#8221; song warbles in the background.</p>
<p>In another moment, those same passionate Slugs would learn how to speak truth to power from the likes of headline-making fellow alumni such as keynote speaker Carmen Perez (Rachel Carson College, psychology), criminal justice reform activist and one of the national co-chairs of the Women&#8217;s March on Washington, and Kris Perry (Merrill &#8217;86, psychology and sociology), the plaintiff in a lawsuit that challenged, and eventually overturned, Proposition 8, a 2008 California constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages.</p>
<p>Everywhere you went, a party, a reunion, an artisanal al fresco lunch, or a speech was unfolding. The spirit was strong this year, with more than 1,700 people registering for this annual celebration.&#160;</p>
<p>On Saturday, a tightly knit group of friends roamed Quarry Plaza wearing matching T-shirts saying, &#8220;UC Santa Cruz Alumni Weekend 2017. Class of 2012. How the hell are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, up in a conference room overlooking the plaza, alumni, faculty, staff,&#160;and students celebrated Black Life at UC Santa Cruz with memorabilia, photos, stories<ins cite="mailto:Gwen%20Jourdonnais" datetime="2017-05-01T14:59">,</ins> and good music.</p>
<p>Sister Paula L. Powell, founding director of&#160;the African American Resource and Cultural Center, recalled the organization's humble beginnings. &#8220;We started out with a budget of $700,&#8221; she said with a chuckle. &#8220;We had to make our own fun.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The organization made the most of it, building a sense of &#8220;home away from home&#8221; and community, and entering into collaborations with other organizations on campus. &#8220;Hey, we did our job!&#8221; she said. &#8220;We laid a foundation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another corner of campus, at Stevenson Lounge, Burke Owens, food professional, former sommelier, and proud parent of two recent UC Santa Cruz alumni, provided a unique immersion course in cocktails from the era of Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>Curious tipplers watched Owens prepare concoctions such as the &#8220;Smoking Bishop,&#8221; the beverage that the enlightened Scrooge shares with his employee Bob Cratchit at the end of <em>A Christmas Carol,</em> and a cold gin punch straight out of <em>The Pickwick Papers</em>.</p>
<p>"Punch is a great way to connect with people: the flowing bowl, the convivial spirit,&#8221; said Owens. He hoped the event would take Slugs &#8220;back to a time that none of us physically lived in, a way to remember or recover something that is long gone, or at least approximate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was so much to do, it was hard to take it all in. But one thread connected every event. Each get-together and celebration evoked a different aspect of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s identity, from doing groundbreaking research to thinking across disciplinary lanes, helping others, and stopping tyranny.</p>
<h3>Get up, stand up!&#160;</h3>
<p>On Friday, celebrants had a chance to take in two memorable crash courses into organizing, refusing to back down, and making history.</p>
<p>That day, Kris Perry, the lead plaintiff in the historical legal challenge that overturned California&#8217;s ban on gay marriage, received this year&#8217;s Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award, along with two standing ovations, during a reception at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.</p>
<p>Perry gave the audience a vivid backdrop about this history-making fight against prejudice.</p>
<p>In 2008, a majority of California voters narrowly passed Proposition 8, eliminating the right of same-sex couples to marry, on the same night the nation elected Barack Obama to the presidency. Perry described her simultaneous feeling of elation and dejection: &#8220;We had come so far and we had lost so much ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certain aspects of her dramatic story approached the surreal. During one juncture of their fight against Proposition 8, the plaintiffs sued the state of California, &#8220;even though they employed me.&#8221; Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the defendant, &#8220;even though I worked for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story&#8217;s dramatic happy ending brought the audience to its feet: &#8220;On the day we won at the Supreme Court, President Obama called us to say he was proud of us. Two days later we were the first couple in California to be married, on the balcony outside the mayor&#8217;s office, beside the bust of Harvey Milk in San Francisco City Hall before hundreds of cheering strangers and my mom with [our son] Elliott as our best man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officiator was none other than Kamala Harris, now a U.S. Senator. <em>Love and Trial,</em> a book about this historic fight, co-written by Perry and wife Sandy Stier, will soon be published, complete with high-profile blurbs from the likes of Chelsea Clinton and Jamie Lee Curtis.</p>
<p>The audience at the Seymour Center included Perry&#8217;s mother and her son, Elliott Perry, a graduating UC Santa Cruz senior from Rachel Carson College.</p>
<h3>United we stand</h3>
<p>That night, the crash course on activism continued in earnest with Carmen Perez, who exhorted the audience to &#8220;find your lane&#8212;do what do you love to do, then take it back to the movement. This is what working separately is.&#8221; Perez wiggled her fingers, then made a fist. &#8220;And this is what working together looks like. This is how you knock down systems of oppression.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need all of you in this movement,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All of you who showed up [to the Women's March on Washington] on Jan. 21&#8212;keep showing up!&#8221;</p>
<p>She also talked about her humble beginnings: &#8220;A little girl from Oxnard led a march.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perez grew up in a community that was vibrant with diversity but struggled with issues such as drug use, gangs, and violence.</p>
<p>The tragic loss of her sister in 1994 galvanized Perez. Devastated, she wanted to end her life. Instead, she changed course and went to UC Santa Cruz, where she had a transformative experience. &#8220;When I came to Santa Cruz, the cloud that had been over me lifted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus transformed and focused her political practice and sharpened her activism. It was an important way station on the road to the Women&#8217;s March. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t just magically show up&#8221; to the movement, she said. &#8220;There was a journey that got me to where I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perez took the time to honor her influential professors, including A&#237;da Hurtado, whose Chicana feminism class was a political and spiritual awakening for Perez. Hurtado pushed Perez very hard&#8212;but Perez came to learn that Hurtado was giving her a hard time for a reason: She was trying to make sure she lived up to her true potential.</p>
<p>Now, Hurtado could not be more proud of her former pupil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so honored to have been on the stage with Carmen,&#8221; said Hurtado, who now holds the endowed chair of the Chicano Studies Department at UC Santa Barbara. &#8220;It is not often that a professor gets to witness a student's success before their very own eyes. The entire event was magical.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Perez&#8217;s speech was powerful and sometimes heartbreaking, she also cracked up the audience by talking about her many run-ins with UC Santa Cruz wildlife, including a slimy banana slug&#8212;&#8220;They are ugly creatures!&#8221; she observed&#8212;to a narrowly avoided dust-up with raccoons, which tried to intimidate her when she brought out the trash. &#8220;They would bring the whole family,&#8217;&#8217; she noted.</p>
<h3>Run for the fun of it</h3>
<p>Perez&#8217;s speech got the audience&#8217;s blood pumping&#8212;and so did the first-ever Fun Run, a joint organizational effort involving UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports (OPERS) as well as the campus Financial Aid Office.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great way to justify the beer we&#8217;re going to be drinking for the rest of the weekend,&#8221; remarked Brett Bell (Cowell,&#8217;12, environmental studies) as he stood at the East Remote parking lot, still cooling off from the race.</p>
<p>Bell ran the course with Jeff Arnett (Merrill &#8217;72, art), a retired creative writing lecturer at UC Santa Cruz. Arnett, coincidentally, was Bell&#8217;s former cross-country coach at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Arnett conceded that parts of the run put him to the test. Even though it snaked from OPERS to the central campus, past the library, and out to Oakes, with breathtaking views, &#8220;It was not a sightseeing tour, let&#8217;s put it that way,&#8221; Arnett said. &#8220;It was a fairly challenging course, especially the first mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Bell said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the nature of the campus.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The shaping of a Slug</h3>
<p>At on- and off-campus events, revelers were rolling back the years and living for the moment, while reflecting on the various ways UC Santa Cruz has shaped them.</p>
<p>Some of the answers were surprising. Asked how UC Santa Cruz changed her life, Nallely Martinez (Cowell '12, art and psychology) pointed to a fellow alumnus, Alexander &#8220;Cosmo&#8221; Martinez (Crown '13, legal studies) and said, &#8220;We got married!&#8221;</p>
<p>Others shared memories that seemed fresh and immediate, even though some of their stories went back 40 years or more. Jeffrey Redding (Cowell &#8217;73, biology), a consultant for the wine industry, could still remember his surprise when he showed up on campus and saw women not only dressing in jeans, but also swearing up a storm every time they missed a shot at Ping-Pong.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family had been living in the Philippines, and my father wanted me to reconnect with American life&#8221; by attending UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Little did he know!&#8221; said Redding with a laugh. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he knew what I was getting into!&#8221;</p>
<p>Arriving at UC Santa Cruz was also a bit of a shock for Rena Ragimova (Stevenson '06, philosophy), a former journalist who now works in marketing. She was born in Moscow, grew up in Los Angeles, and showed up with her parents, who stared out the window at the rural campus and said, &#8220;What is this farm?&#8221;</p>
<p>She initially studied economics because it was hard to resist a practical approach to her education. &#8220;I&#8217;m an immigrant child,&#8217;&#8217; she explained. But Ragimova soon switched to philosophy. &#8220;I wanted to know how to live life. What is this all about? At one point I had an experience that made me realize that life is not a series of stages&#8212;do this, do that&#8212;but something you improvise along the way. But how do you go about doing that?&#8221;</p>
<p>To this day, she finds herself reaching into her bookshelf and pulling out philosophy books just for fun.</p>
<h3>Going back to school</h3>
<p>During their Teach-In about the exciting possibilities of stem cell research, professors Lindsay Hinck, Camilla Forsberg, and Daniel Kim explained how stem cells worked before going into the details of their research.</p>
<p>Quite simply, &#8220;stem cells make other cells, with a unique ability to &#8216;self-renew&#8217; (make more stem cells) and &#8216;differentiate&#8217; (make other cells),&#8221; said Forsberg.</p>
<p>Stem cells &#8220;know&#8221; how to make heart and liver and all the cell types in the body, which is why there are so many exciting possibilities, Forsberg said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the potential is to permanently cure disease in one single treatment as opposed to taking a pill or drug or undergo multiple treatments. If we can train stem cells to behave normally in our bodies, it is a one-time shot that lasts forever. What is better than a cure? Never get sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>While researchers can now make &#8220;pluripotent&#8221; cells that can make any other cell in the body, scientists must increase their understanding of how this process works. &#8220;To know how to engineer a cell, you have to know all the parts,&#8221; said Kim, while showing a daunting diagram of a disassembled car, a mess of doors, wheels, and tiny screws. "It is a complicated system. To engineer this car you need to understand every component.&#8221;</p>
<p>The more researchers learn about these cells, the more that knowledge can be applied to promising new treatments for cancer, neural degenerative diseases, and injuries, training the next generation of scientists to improve human health, the presenters said.</p>
<p>In another far-ranging Teach-In presentation, Associate Professor of Feminist Studies Gina Dent addressed the role of the humanities in the "post-truth" era.</p>
<p>Dent&#8217;s ambitious presentation went far beyond the idea of using facts to refute distortions and lies. Instead, she talked about the power of architecture, film, and literature to evoke deeper truths that cannot necessarily be found in cold facts.</p>
<p>As examples, she talked about and showed a powerful scene from Julie Dash&#8217;s 1991 independent film Daughters of the Dust. Though this is an imaginative work, the film, set in the early 20th century on St. Helena Island, captures vivid truths about black life and culture, even in instances when it does not use &#8220;realism as a form of representation.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet the film &#8220;very carefully encodes so much cultural knowledge&#8221; in a way that no mere &#8220;fact sheet&#8221; could ever achieve.</p>
<p>On the flip side, she also talked about the way that people, without even realizing it, can receive distorted or simplistic ideas about prison life through popular media and film, without even realizing this media has shaped their outlook.</p>
<h3>Happy anniversary, baby</h3>
<p>During Alumni Weekend, the Natural History Field Quarter, Crown College, and Grupo Folklorico Los Mexicas all held important anniversary celebrations. These get-togethers were a great way to show just how far each highlighted organization, department, interest group, or division had come.</p>
<p>This was certainly the case at the Baskin School of Engineering, where alumni, faculty, and staff celebrated 20 years of the engineering school. &#8220;History was made here,&#8221; said professor of biomolecular engineering David Haussler. &#8220;Here is where we posted the first human genome on the internet. No one anticipated that when the department was built. We&#8217;re not building airplanes here. We are free to focus on nano-bio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baskin Dean Alexander Wolf talked about just how much the engineering school has advanced. &#8220;The Baskin School of Engineering grew up with the internet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The internet age was turned from a simple, and in its original form, invisible communication mechanism to something that has transformed people&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school started with computer science, created a molecular engineering department, and brought in genomics and computational media, along with gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Many engineering schools still have a 19th century orientation, focusing on chemical, mechanical, and civil engineering, &#8220;but this is a 21st century engineering school, focusing on subjects that are relevant to our time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But the school has shaped many lives and outlooks, and not just careers. Like many other returning alumni reflecting on their academic careers, Eric Carter (Crown&#160; &#8217;07, engineering) said the school taught him more than just a discipline. It also provided a new way of thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Studying here forced me to distill down and understand all the components of a problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Any kind of problem.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cb106c328072701702deaeb0363ab27a"><name>controlled-burn-arboretum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Controlled burn at the Arboretum</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is conducting a controlled agricultural burn today from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</summary><start-date>1493276400000</start-date><display-name>Controlled burn at the Arboretum</display-name><path>/2017/04/controlled-burn-arboretum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/04/controlled-burn-arboretum</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1493760501411</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1493760501411</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is conducting a controlled agricultural burn today from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The burn is taking place at the northeast corner of the Australia Garden (near the western edge of the farm).</p>

It&#8217;s wonderful looking back and celebrating where we&#8217;ve been. Now it is time to look at where we are going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month a group of representatives from the campus and the Santa Cruz community has started the task of charting our future here at UC Santa Cruz. These leaders, with input from you and the community as a whole, will do so through the creation of our 2020 Long-Range Development Plan, or 2020 LRDP. Our goal is to have a draft plan in hand by mid- to late 2018, at which point it will undergo a thorough environmental review. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exactly is an LRDP? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it like a city or county general plan. It designates areas for certain types of use or open space, but in and of itself, it does not mandate growth or areas of growth. It plans for growth if needed and funded. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of professional planners, we will first examine the existing use of our campus lands and facilities, of our housing and learning spaces. We will reaffirm our values and principles, and explore our role in our community and our obligation to the state. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our 2005 LRDP, updated more than a decade ago, identifies an enrollment envelope of 19,500 students. We are below that, at roughly 17,500, yet demand for a UC Santa Cruz education is at an all-time high, as is student diversity, reflecting the state. Our responsibility is figuring out how to educate the next generation of California leaders while also protecting what makes our campus special. Among the questions we aim to ask&#8212;and answer: How can we accommodate additional enrollment? Where do we plan for new facilities to meet the demands of emerging and unexplored areas of scholarship and knowledge? What would expansion of our existing footprint look like? Can we reimagine the use of existing buildings? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can we accomplish our goals and remain a good community partner?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any growth has real effects on the surrounding community. For that reason, I strongly believe that this process must be collaborative. We will seek your input&#8212;and the greater community&#8217;s&#8212;as we strive to meet our obligation to California&#8217;s young adults and to be a good neighbor. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a new tack for us. We&#8217;ve been working in tandem with the community to tackle the difficult issues we together face. Chief among them is adequate housing for students and employees. Water use, environmental protection, and job creation are also vital to address, and this process allows for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you&#8217;d expect, developing this contingent land-use plan will be challenging. None of the questions above are easy, but they&#8217;re important to tackle. In the end, I&#8217;m confident that together we can chart an innovative, sustainable, and exciting future for UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So please join me in this process. In the coming months there will be multiple opportunities to express your opinions and provide your input. We will have meetings on campus and off. We will engage with you in person and online. In the meantime, I am reaching out to local government officials and others to also let them know how this process will unfold.</span></p>

Bob, an</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> internationally acclaimed biologist, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">died peacefully at his home on Saturday, April 22, surrounded by family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not many can say they played a key role in the evolution of a great public university, but that's precisely what Bob did. He leaves a lasting legacy both here at UC Santa Cruz, where he was chancellor from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1977 to 1987, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and in the annals of science. Certainly many played a role in the historic push to map the human genome, but Bob </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had the audacious vision, beckoning a host of eminent biologists to UC Santa Cruz in 1985 to map out how it could actually be done. That circle was completed 15 years later, when UC Santa Cruz assembled the first sequence of the human genome. The project, fittingly, started and ended here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Bob was a pre-eminent scientist, he also was a thoughtful campus leader. He advocated for us. He consulted faculty. He listened to students &#8212; even when he didn&#8217;t always agree. Our esteemed Slug was adopted during Bob&#8217;s tenure, much to his initial chagrin. We laughed about it years later. He had become a fan. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob had a vigor for life. While I first met him when he was chancellor, my wife Kelly and I had the pleasure of getting to know Bob and his wife Karen better after I became chancellor. We attended his 95th birthday celebration in Santa Barbara a couple of years ago. Incredibly, he was still going into the UC Santa Barbara biology labs even then, and working out with a personal trainer three times a week. That was Bob &#8212; active, engaged, and always forward-looking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loss of his wife Karen in 2015 was a painful blow. She was a vibrant person herself who helped transform University House into a hub of social and intellectual engagement for the campus and the community. They were a fantastic and formidable pair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you'll join me in taking a moment to recognize Bob&#8217;s incredible contributions to campus. Kelly and I extend our condolences to his family, and to the many people on and off campus who had the good fortune to call Bob a colleague or friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A memorial service is being planned; the family asks that any contributions in Bob&#8217;s memory be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made to The UC Santa Cruz Foundation - Sinsheimer Biological Research Fund, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor George R.
