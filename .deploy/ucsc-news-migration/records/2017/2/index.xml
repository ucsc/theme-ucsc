music professor David Dunn has joined forces with two forest scientists from Northern Arizona University to combat an insect infestation that is killing millions of trees throughout the West.<br/>
 <br/>
 They are applying the results of nearly a decade of acoustic research in an unconventional collaborative effort to stop bark beetles from tunneling through the living tissue of weakened, drought-stressed pine trees. <br/>
 <br/>
 The trio has now received a patent for a device that uses sound as a targeted sonic weapon to disrupt the feeding, communication, reproduction, and various other essential behaviors of the insects. <br/>
 <br/>
 Dunn explained how this research came about.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;When massive tree death started occurring in Northern New Mexico where I was living, I became curious if there were sounds associated with such a large amount of biological activity,&#8221; said Dunn. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;At that time there was still the assumption that this was the result of a local bark beetle infestation due to drought conditions. Since then, we have come to realize that this was not just a local outbreak but one of many outbreaks across all of the western states and Canadian provinces that has been driven by climate change conditions. Many scientists think that we are experiencing the largest insect infestation of North America in the fossil record of the Earth,&#8221; he added.<br/>
 <br/>
 Dunn spent a few weeks thinking about how to listen to the interior of trees and soon came up with a simple listening device that cost less than $10 to build. Designing unique and inexpensive devices in order to listen to sound had long been a part of his artistic work.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;After making hundreds of hours of recordings inside hundreds of trees, I made a large sound composition that represented the incredible diversity of sounds made by a couple of species of bark beetles and their changing responses to the life cycle of tree hosts that they invade,&#8221; said Dunn. &#8220;This was released as a CD (<em>The Sound of Light in Trees</em>) that garnered a lot of attention from both the sound, art, and music community, as well as various scientists involved in bio-acoustic research.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;After that interest emerged, I was approached by my future colleagues at Northern Arizona University who not only wanted to replicate what I had done, but to collaborate on how to push this research further. These further results led to the device and protocol that we have just patented.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Dunn noted that it is very unusual</strong> for a scientific patent to be awarded to an artist and added that there are very few examples of concrete results from collaborations between artists and scientists.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;My contribution to the project mostly concerned the technical design aspects of the audio, electronic circuit designs, and the novel sound gathering techniques,&#8221; Dunn explained. &#8220;In a very real sense, this represented a kind of reverse "tech transfer" from the arts to the sciences. Historically, it has usually been the other way around.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We have now entered into a period of common interests between art and science largely driven by the commonality of digital tools,&#8221; Dunn added. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Artists are now just as involved in designing such tools as the scientific community and often create software and instrumentation in order to facilitate their creative visions that may ultimately be of even greater value to scientific research. I think that this was one of those instances and a couple of fortuitous events conspired to allow something interesting to happen.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Dunn observed that one important aspect of art/science collaborations is the peculiar ability of artists to trust their imagination over their rational faculty. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Most of the best scientists I know have fantastic and expansive imaginative capacities but often have to strategically mask those skills in order to operate within disciplinary and professional constraints,&#8221; said Dunn. &#8220;I personally believe that science must be a deeply rigorous enterprise, but it is not an either/or issue. It is the balance between the rational and imaginative that will ultimately solve the most serious problems that threaten us.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Artists can sometimes ask the pithy or embarrassing question that needs to be asked, or cuts across disciplinary constraints, or politics, without paying a professional price. As Gregory Bateson, a former faculty member of UC Santa Cruz put it: &#8216;rigor alone is paralytic death, imagination alone is insanity.&#8217;"<br/>
 <br/>
 Dunn said that he and his colleagues at Northern Arizona University&#8212;Richard Hofstetter and Reagan McGuire--hope to produce a range of products as a result of their patent to combat bark beetles, as well as other insects related to them.<br/>
 <br/>
 He added that scaling up the device to be effective in saving large forests might be possible through the use of local wireless or FM broadcast to protect select areas of forest, depending on how cheaply they can produce an effective system that can be applied to individual trees.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;One major obstacle is the issue of how to miniaturize the analog circuits and sample playback,&#8221; said Dunn. &#8220;One of my brilliant graduate students, David Kant in music, has been working on putting all of this into digital form and has largely succeeded. If we can solve that problem and come up with viable output transducers, amplification, and solar power solutions, it's very doable.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="010a5a5f8072701752a34ca341687189"><name>coral-art-opening</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Crochet coral reef exhibition to open Feb. 10 at Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery</title><summary>"Crochet Coral Reef: CO2CA-CO2LA Ocean," an exhibition by Margaret and Christine Wertheim and the Institute For Figuring, is an artistic response to global warming and the growing problem of plastic trash accumulating in the ocean. </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, coral reefs, global warming, ucsc arts division, ucsc institute of arts and sciences, crochet, ocean health</keywords><start-date>1486078800000</start-date><display-name>Crochet coral reef exhibition to open Feb. 10 at Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery</display-name><path>/2017/02/coral-art-opening</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/coral-art-opening</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1486076138682</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487876477822</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/coral-reef-project-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/coral-reef-project-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-reef-project-375.jpg</name><display-name>coral-reef-project-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>348769</file-size><width>375</width><height>281</height></image><image-alt>The Toxic Reef at the the Sant Ocean Hall, in the Smithsonian © Institute For Figuring</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/coral-exhibition-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/coral-exhibition-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-exhibition-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>coral-exhibition-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>37495</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>The Toxic Reef at the the Sant Ocean Hall, in the Smithsonian © Institute For Figuring</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The&#160;<em>Toxic Reef</em>&#160;at the&#160;the Sant Ocean Hall, in the&#160;Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C., 2011 (Institute For Figuring&#8217;s Crochet Coral Reef project, 2005&#8211;ongoing)&#160;&#169;

<br/>
 Melding mathematics, marine biology, handicraft, and community art practice, it spotlights not only the damage humans do to the earth's environment, but also their capacity for positive action.</p>
<p>The exhibition is designed to bring people together to embrace a devastating ecological challenge: the survival of coral reefs and marine ecologies throughout the globe.<br/>
<br/>
 Presented by the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery and the Arts Division&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences, <em>Crochet Coral Reef: CO2CA-CO2LA Ocean</em> will open at UC Santa Cruz on February 10, running through May 6.<br/>
<br/>
 Admission is free and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
 The Werheim&#8217;s Crochet Coral Reef project has been exhibited in art and science museums worldwide, including the Museum of Art and Design (New York), the Andy Warhol Museum (Pittsburgh), the Hayward Gallery (London), the Science Gallery (Dublin), and the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History (Washington, DC).<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;This fall, I saw the magnificent Crochet Coral Reef exhibition in New York at the Museum of Art and Design, including all of the pieces we&#8217;re bringing to the Sesnon Gallery,&#8221; said John Weber, director of the Institute for Arts and Sciences.&#160; &#8220;I can guarantee that our community will be blown away by the jaw-dropping beauty and dazzling complexity of these works of art.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We are showing a number of the giant crochet coral &#8216;forests&#8217; in the show,&#8221; Weber added. &#8220;These are the largest works in the Crochet Coral Reef, often standing over six feet high. Some are crocheted almost entirely from plastic and synthetic materials such as salvaged video and audiotape, echoing the immense accumulation of plastic in the oceans. They are an ecological wake-up call--a darkly elegant, sobering testimony to what humans are doing to the marine ecosystem.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 An opening public reception will take place in the gallery on Friday, February 10, from 5 to 7 p.m. Prior to the reception, Christine Wertheim will present an artist talk at 4 p.m., at the Digital Arts Research Center (DARC 108).<br/>
<br/>
 The public will also have a chance to meet the artists at the gallery on Saturday, February 11, from 2 to 4 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I think every visitor will be impressed and surprised by the scope and scale of this exhibition, as it tackles big issues on climate change, ocean acidification, plastic trash, and community art-making,&#8221; said Sesnon Gallery Director Shelby Graham. &#8220;When you realize this powerful story is being told through crochet, you&#8217;ll want to learn about the math, science, and collaborative art practices behind it all.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We are thrilled to host such a provocative exhibition at the Sesnon Art Gallery,&#8221; she added, &#8220;Our goal is to reach out to all our students and community members to encourage them to see--and become involved in--this timely project.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Weber noted that like coral colonies themselves, the Crochet Coral Reef is a product of collective, rather than strictly individual, efforts.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;That&#8217;s why it feels so life-like, so ecologically and structurally complex,&#8221; said Weber.&#160; &#8220;What you&#8217;re seeing is not just one artist&#8217;s idea, it&#8217;s the synergy of many minds, eyes, and hands working together.&#8221;<br/>

<p>MCC, as it&#8217;s known on campus, is set to celebrate its 30th anniversary in early February, marking a long history of connecting students with UCSC alumni who know the challenges of making that daunting next step after graduation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is really one of the most important things we do here at the career center,&#8221; said Barbara Silverthorne, director of the UC Santa Cruz Career Center. &#8220;Sometimes students lack the professional connections they need, and this is the epitome of what we do. We help them make those connections.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Silverthorne, the emphasis on multiculturalism is particularly important, as the opportunity for students of color, who may feel increased anxiety about navigating the workforce or graduate school, to interact with those who have already successfully done so is crucial.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very unique connection between students of color and alumni of color,&#8221; Silverthorne said. &#8220;It allows the students to say to themselves &#8216;Somebody has gone before me and paved the path.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nancy Kim, now the director of UCSC&#8217;s Asian American/Pacific Islander, recalls her experience as a UCSC student in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really appreciated the opportunity to attend,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;It was the first time I learned about the challenges of graduate school.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Careers and beyond</h3>
<p>The MCC goes beyond helping seniors looking to enter the workforce. It also caters to students thinking about pursuing a graduate degree, going to medical school, or taking the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).</p>
<p>&#8220;The alumni talk about what they&#8217;ve done after life at UCSC and includes some who&#8217;ve gone to grad school, some straight into their careers, and others talk about taking times to figure out themselves,&#8221; said Sheila Rodriguez, the assistant director of Career Development at the Career Center.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always about graduating seniors either, according to Silverthorne. Some underclassmen attend to learn about how to orient their education toward career or graduate school goals. Others are there to learn about internship opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We try to touch people at all different points of their education, at all different levels,&#8221; Silverthorne said.</p>
<p>For some of the alumni who attend, they also use the conference as a headhunting opportunity, either looking for young people to help out with summer internships, and&#8212;in some cases&#8212;looking for college graduates to fill entry level positions in their various organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great networking opportunity for the alumni as well,&#8221; Silverthorne said. &#8220;Some of them went to the MCC and they are paying it forward, and others have been coming to the MCC for a long time and they enjoy connecting with students and find it rewarding.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Inspired by alumni</h3>
<p>This year&#8217;s keynote speaker is Jacob Martinez. A UC Santa Cruz alumnus, who is the founder and executive director of Digital Nest, a Watsonville based nonprofit that is focused on bridging the digital divide by both bringing innovative technology education platforms to students in Watsonville, while also encouraging young Latina women to pursue tech careers.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been involved in creating a pipeline between students of color in the Pajaro Valley and technology fields,&#8221; Silverthorne said.</p>
<p>As MCC looks back on its 30-year history, there have been a plethora of speakers from a diversity of fields including, medicine, law, technology, government and non-profit, among others.</p>
<p>Past speakers included Katrina Cervantez Alejo, a former mayor of Watsonville and only the second Latina to fulfill that role in the city&#8217;s history, and Kevin Filer, who was born and raised in Compton, and went on to become a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of the students who attend the MCC are the first in their families to go to college,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;It can be overwhelming for students who may not have the family and cultural capital to walk you through the steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kim is the daughter of immigrants. While her parents had college experience in their home country of Korea, she found the prospect of the rigors of graduate school in America daunting. MCC provided her with a clear picture of the challenges she would face in graduate school, she said, and it helped to soothe some of her anxiety.</p>
<p>These challenges can be particularly daunting for students of color with majors in the liberal arts&#8212;whether it&#8217;s philosophy, literature, history or the social sciences&#8212;where the path from education to career is not always as clear as say someone who pursues an accounting or business degree</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of jobs that can come from any major,&#8221; Silverthorne said. &#8220;What a lot of our majors teach is critical thinking, written and oral communication skills and the ability to analyze data, whether its words or numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those are all high on the list of what employers want, Silverthorne said, so students can rest assured they are equipped with the skills necessary to flourish in what has recently become an expanding workforce with a historically low unemployment rate.</p>
<p>But Kim said students need to use the MCC as an opportunity to focus on what they want out their careers and not just what their careers will want out of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The MCC offers a space for students to incorporate what they feel about their cultural, ethnic and various intersecting identities and how to carry that to the next phase,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The 30th anniversary of the Multicultural Career Conference is slated of Saturday, February 11. It begins at 9:30 a.m. and runs until 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Following the speech, students will break out into workshop sessions according to various careers such as arts and media, health and science, education, business, government/nonprofit, law, and technology.</p>

<p>Tromp will serve as the chief academic officer and provide academic leadership to UC Santa Cruz. She will manage the campus budget, guide the campus through long-term planning, and advise Chancellor George Blumenthal. She succeeds Alison Galloway who stepped down in December.</p>
<p>"In a competitive field of highly qualified candidates, Marlene&#8217;s commitment to excellence stood out,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;She understands and appreciates the culture of UC Santa Cruz. She embraces our innovative spirit, values the role of faculty consultation in effective shared governance, and is committed to diversity and to making educational opportunities available to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tromp&#8217;s priorities include engaging faculty in the creation of a vibrant academic and research vision, bringing an entrepreneurial spirit to the creation of new sources of revenue, providing focused leadership to support student academic needs, and growing the commitment to serving first-generation college students and a diverse student population.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am genuinely honored and excited to join UC Santa Cruz and its extraordinary faculty as they transform the lives of their already-remarkable students and transform the world around them with their discoveries,&#8221; Tromp said. &#8220;I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with Chancellor Blumenthal and the talented staff, and I hope to bring my experience to bear in ways that benefit our entire community.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to serving as vice provost at ASU, Tromp is also dean of ASU&#8217;s New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences and a professor of English and women and gender studies.</p>
<p>Tromp was a full professor at Denison University in Ohio from 2002 to 2008 and served as chair and director of Women&#8217;s Studies. She joined Arizona State University in 2011 as director of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Cultural Studies, and worked closely with faculty to invigorate humanities and arts education.</p>
<p>Since 2013, she has been the dean of the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences, a role that has her overseeing programs and faculty in mathematical and natural sciences; social and behavioral sciences, and humanities, arts and cultural studies. &#160;As vice provost, Tromp oversees the coordination of its seven colleges, the campus climate and vision, and collaborations with local governments, private foundations, businesses, and other academic entities.</p>
<p>Tromp has overseen the growth of West Campus, and aided the colleges in working collaboratively to achieve a sense of community. Under her leadership, the campus has increased internal resource generation, developed new collaborative degree programs, supported the faculty, and strengthened relationships with the community.</p>
<p>Tromp will join UC Santa Cruz when interest and awareness is at a record high. The campus received more than 52,000 freshman applications for fall 2017, a professor earned a $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, and a $300 million comprehensive fundraising campaign is nearing completion.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/global-rankings.html">ranked</a> by U.S. News and World Report as one of the top 50 universities in the world, continues to take innovative approaches to support its diverse student body, grow its Silicon Valley Campus, and further its international presence.</p>
<p>Tromp earned her Ph.D. from the University of Florida, M.A. in English from the University of Wyoming, and B.A. in English from Creighton University in Nebraska.</p>
<p>A Victorianist and cultural studies scholar, she reads the 19th century against the contemporary cultural moment. She is the author of <em>Altered States: Sex, Nation, Drugs, and Self-Transformation in Victorian Spiritualism</em> (SUNY 2006), <em>The Private Rod: Sexual Violence, Marriage, and the Law in Victorian England</em> (UP Virginia 2000), and more than twenty essays and chapters on 19th century culture.</p>
<p>Tromp&#8217;s faculty appointment is pending review by the UC Santa Cruz academic senate and administration.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2017/02/cpevc-announcement</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2017/02/cpevc-announcement</link><site>news</site><name>cpevc-announcement</name><display-name>Leadership</display-name><title>Welcoming Marlene Tromp to UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Tromp, vice provost at Arizona State University's West Campus and a professor of English and women and gender studies, will arrive on campus June 1.</summary><keywords>campus provost, executive vice chancellor, leadership,</keywords><start-date>Feb 3, 2017 12:00 AM</start-date></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title>Welcoming Marlene Tromp to UC Santa Cruz</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="056721e68072701752a34ca333ea0963"><name>service-outage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ITS Service Outage Notice: Campus Directory, CruzID Manager, Campus Telephones</title><start-date>1486022400000</start-date><display-name>ITS Service Outage Notice: Campus Directory, CruzID Manager, Campus Telephones</display-name><path>/2017/02/service-outage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/service-outage</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1486149328028</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1486149328028</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This Saturday, Feb. 4 from 8AM to Noon, ITS will be performing work that requires a four hour outage to the Campus Directory and to CruzID Manager.

<p>Through the Slug Quest website, third-party businesses and employers can post job openings for eligible students seeking employment. The Career Center has attempted to notify Slug Quest users as well.</p>
<p>In the scam, a person identifying himself as John Seth is posing as a hiring manager/employer and encouraging students to contract with him for employment opportunities. These scam "job opportunities" often take the form of "personal or office assistants" and frequently ask a student to purchase items for the business, deposit checks for the business, or negotiate sales between a vendor and a business.</p>
<p>The aim of the scam is to get students to deposit a fraudulent checks (that will bounce in a few days/weeks) and purchase items or send personal checks with their own money. The perpetrator of the scam is also attempting to collect personal information that could be used in future identity theft (address, Social Security Numbers, bank information, etc.).</p>
<p>Members of the campus community are advised to not cash checks from unfamiliar companies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department cautions against making payments or revealing personal information over the phone or online to anyone you do not know.</p>
<p>If anyone has been victim to this scam, please contact our dispatch center to file a report at <a href="tel:831-459-2231">(831) 459-2231 x1</a>.

We want you to know what we are doing to build a campus culture that does not tolerate sexual misconduct of any kind, and invite you to join us.</p>
<p>Our priority is the safety and well being of our campus community. Safety begins with education and awareness, but we must overcome the cultural and institutional barriers that hinder reporting when violations occur. We can only take action when individuals come forward.</p>
<p>To that end, we want to ensure that all students, staff, and faculty are aware of the <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu/">resources</a> available to them&#8212;both to educate themselves now, and to utilize if they experience unwanted sexual behavior of any kind. The range of resources available to victims include confidential counseling, consultation with the Title IX Office, which oversees compliance with federal laws regarding sex discrimination, and reporting to campus police. Links to top-line resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://titleix.ucsc.edu/">Title IX Office</a></li>
<li><a href="http://care.ucsc.edu/">Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education Office</a></li>
<li><a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu/">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response</a></li>
<li><a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Police Department</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Prevention begins with education, and the Title IX Office offers online and in-person training to faculty and other academics. Following last spring's town hall about sexual violence, a group of faculty formed a "Beyond Compliance" task force to evaluate current practices and make recommendations to campus leaders.</p>
<p>We are evaluating our campus processes for reporting and investigating <a href="http://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/capm/002.015.html">faculty code-of-conduct complaints</a>. We are <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/11/title-ix.html">investing in our Title IX Office</a>, and we are not alone in seeking to improve campus procedures. At the systemwide level, the UC Office of the President has adopted new policies regarding faculty behavior, and OP has hired a systemwide coordinator of Title IX processes and procedures.</p>
<p>We want to go further and acknowledge the power differentials that can impede a victim's willingness to report incidents, particularly between faculty and students. We recognize that students may fear that grades, letters of recommendation, job prospects, and entire careers are on the line.</p>
<p>This is why we believe it is critical that faculty take leadership roles in changing the campus culture. We urge our colleagues to educate themselves about the Faculty Code of Conduct and UC policies regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment, and we encourage faculty to take proactive steps when they see or hear colleagues engaging in unacceptable behavior. Zero tolerance starts with each of us.</p>
<p>We have steadily invested in public-awareness campaigns around sexual violence and sexual assault, and we have seen a corresponding increase in the number of reports received by the Title IX Office, but there is more to do. We must find new ways to reach students, as well.</p>
<p>We welcome your input and engagement. Working together, we can improve the campus climate for all members of the UC Santa Cruz community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee, Vice Chancellor of Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham, Interim Vice Provost for Student Success Jaye Padgett </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0622f9de8072701752a34ca3a0635e7f"><name>climate-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC climate conference draws top scientists, policy makers Feb. 24-25</title><summary>UCSC will host a national conference on climate change featuring top climate scientists and policy experts from across the country.</summary><keywords>Climate Change, climate change conference, global warming</keywords><start-date>1486393200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC climate conference draws top scientists, policy makers February 24-25</display-name><path>/2017/02/climate-conference</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/climate-conference</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1486161638502</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487453882024</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/ramanathan-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/ramanathan-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramanathan-375.jpg</name><display-name>ramanathan-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>72948</file-size><width>375</width><height>280</height></image><image-alt>Veerabhadran Ramanathan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/conference-image-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/conference-image-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>conference-image-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>conference-image-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18071</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>conference poster image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Climate scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan will give the keynote lecture at the UCSC Climate Conference.

<p>"<a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/2017-climate-conference/">Changing Climate: Acting Now to Secure a Sustainable Future</a>" is co-sponsored by the UCSC divisions of Physical and Biological Sciences and Social Sciences. The event is free and open to the public, but advance <a href="http://bit.ly/climate2017">registration is required</a>.</p>
<p>The conference begins Friday evening with a keynote lecture by renowned climate scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan, "Climate Change Morphing into an Existential Threat: Need for a New Approach." A distinguished professor of atmospheric and climate sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, Ramanathan has been widely honored for his contributions to climate science, and his discoveries have led to many policy actions to slow climate change. Gov. Jerry Brown, Pope Francis, and the Dalai Lama are among those who have sought his advice on climate issues. His talk will take place in the Media Theater on the UCSC campus at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>On Saturday, all conference events will take place at the College Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room on the UCSC campus starting at 10 a.m. A series of panel discussions will focus on the actions society can take to prevent catastrophic climate change. The "Engineering Change" panel will consider the most viable clean, renewable options for powering society; "Motivating Change" will evaluate the economic and policy incentives needed to drive rapid adoption of those options; and "Communicating Change" will feature journalists and educators discussing ways to mobilize communities to action.</p>
<p>The conference will conclude with a special evening session on "Climate Change Science and Policy in a President Trump Administration." Sponsored by the Fred Keeley Lecture in Environmental Policy, the discussion will be moderated by Fred Keeley, former state assemblyman and county treasurer. Panelists will include Ken Alex, senior policy advisor to Gov. Jerry Brown and director of the Office of Planning and Research; Miriam Greenberg, UCSC professor of sociology; John Laird, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency; and Erika Zavaleta, UCSC professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>02-28-2017</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0679a5298072701752a34ca3f2c6f4c5"><name>west-nile-virus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Drought identified as key to severity of West Nile virus epidemics </title><summary>Researchers found that drought dramatically increases the severity of West Nile virus epidemics in the United States.</summary><keywords>Marm Kilpatrick, West Nile virus, mosquitoes</keywords><start-date>1486512000000</start-date><display-name>Drought identified as key to severity of West Nile virus epidemics </display-name><path>/2017/02/west-nile-virus</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/west-nile-virus</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1486167318483</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1486511735874</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/culex-pipiens-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/culex-pipiens-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>culex-pipiens-400.jpg</name><display-name>culex-pipiens-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>60928</file-size><width>400</width><height>304</height></image><image-alt>Culex pipiens mosquito</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/culex-pipiens-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/culex-pipiens-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>culex-pipiens-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>culex-pipiens-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17149</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Culex pipiens mosquito</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><em>Culex pipiens</em> is among the mosquito species that are important in transmitting West Nile virus in North America.

<p>The study, published February 8 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B,</em> involved researchers from UC Santa Cruz, Stanford University, and the New York State Department of Health. They analyzed 15 years of data on human West Nile virus infections from across the United States and found that epidemics were much larger in drought years and in regions that had not suffered large epidemics in the past.</p>
<p>"We found that drought was the dominant weather variable correlated with the size of West Nile virus epidemics," said first author Sara Paull, who led the study as a post-doctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and is now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.</p>
<p><strong>Yearly epidemics</strong></p>
<p>West Nile virus was introduced into North America in 1999 and has caused yearly epidemics each summer since. The intensity of these epidemics, however, has varied enormously. In some years, there were only a few hundred severe human cases nationally, whereas in each of three years (2002, 2003, and 2012), approximately 3,000 people suffered brain-damaging meningitis or encephalitis, and almost 300 died. The variation at the state level has been even higher, with yearly case numbers varying 50-fold from year to year, on average. The causes of this enormous variation were unknown and had led scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suggest that predicting the size of future epidemics was difficult or impossible.</p>
<p>In the new study, Paull and Marm Kilpatrick, an associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, analyzed patterns in the number of severe West Nile virus infections each year in each state and nationally. They examined a number of weather variables, including summer temperature, precipitation, winter severity, and drought. They also tested a long-standing hypothesis that the disease shows a wave-like pattern in causing large outbreaks in the first year and few cases subsequently due to a build-up of immunity in bird populations, which are the main hosts for the virus.</p>
<p>"We found strong evidence that in some regions the spread of West Nile virus was indeed wave-like, with large outbreaks followed by fewer cases," Paull said. "However, our analyses indicated that human immunity--not just bird immunity--played a large part in the decrease in human cases by reducing the number of people susceptible to the disease."</p>
<p>Kilpatrick said the links with drought were unexpected. In collaboration with Dr. Laura Kramer from the New York State Department of Health, his lab had developed a very careful method of mapping the influence of temperature on the biology of both the virus and the three different mosquitoes that are most important in transmitting the virus.</p>
<p>"We thought epidemics would coincide with the most ideal temperatures for transmission," Kilpatrick said. "Instead, we found that the severity of drought was far more important nationally, and drought appeared to be a key driver in the majority of individual states as well."</p>
<p>It's not yet clear how drought increases transmission of the virus, he said. Data from Colorado indicate that drought increases the fraction mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus, but not the abundance of mosquitoes. Drought might affect transmission between mosquitoes and birds by stressing birds or changing where they congregate.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Climate change</strong></p>
<p>With the help of climatologists Dan Horton and Noah Diffenbaugh at Stanford University, Paull used the links between drought, immunity, and West Nile virus to project the impacts of climate change on future epidemics. Over the next three decades, drought is projected to increase in many regions across the United States due to increased temperatures, despite increases in precipitation in some of the same areas.</p>
<p>Model projections indicated that increased drought could double the size of future West Nile virus epidemics, but that outbreaks would be limited to regions that have yet to sustain large numbers of cases. These findings provide a tool to help guide public health efforts to regions most likely to experience future epidemics.</p>

This is more than ten times longer than any observed episode of a star&#8217;s death by black hole.</p>
<p>Researchers made this discovery using data from NASA&#8217;s Chandra X-ray Observatory and Swift satellite as well as ESA&#8217;s XMM-Newton. They published their findings February 6 in <em>Nature Astronomy</em>.</p>
<p>The trio of orbiting X-ray telescopes found evidence for a &#8220;tidal disruption event&#8221; (TDE), wherein the tidal forces due to the intense gravity from a black hole can destroy an object &#8211; such as a star &#8211; that wanders too close. During a TDE, some of the stellar debris is flung outward at high speeds, while the rest falls toward the black hole. As it travels inwards to be ingested by the black hole, the material heats up to millions of degrees and generates a distinct x-ray flare.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have witnessed a star&#8217;s spectacular and prolonged demise,&#8221; said Dacheng Lin from the University of New Hampshire in Durham, who led the study. &#8220;Dozens of tidal disruption events have been detected since the 1990s, but none that remained bright for nearly as long as this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to coauthor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, the observations of this TDE with a long-lasting bright phase fit the theoretical predications made in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...809..166G">a 2015 paper</a> he wrote with a former graduate student, coauthor James Guillochon, now at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p>"We correctly predicted in advance of observations that some TDEs would be discovered with long-lived light curves," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "The pieces of the star have to make an accretion disk promptly in order for the material to be digested by the black hole. With a lower mass black hole, stars can get disrupted farther away from the event horizon, and as a result we expect circularization and accretion to be slow."</p>
<p>The extraordinary long bright phase of this event spanning over ten years means that a large amount of mass had to be digested by the black hole. The theoretical model supports either the complete digestion of a star with twice the mass of the sun, or the partial disruption of a much more massive star, Ramirez-Ruiz said, adding that he favors the full disruption of a lower mass star.</p>
<p>The X-ray source containing this force-fed black hole, known by its abbreviated name of XJ1500+0154, is located in a small galaxy about 1.8 billion light years from Earth.</p>
<p>The source was not detected in a Chandra observation on April 2nd, 2005, but was detected in an XMM-Newton observation on July 23rd, 2005, and reached peak brightness in a Chandra observation on June 5, 2008. These observations show that the source became at least 100 times brighter in x-rays. Since then, Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton have observed it multiple times.</p>
<p>The sharp x-ray vision of Chandra data shows that XJ1500+0154 is located at the center of its host galaxy, the expected location for a supermassive black hole. The x-ray data also indicate that radiation from material surrounding this black hole has consistently surpassed the so-called Eddington limit, defined by a balance between the outward pressure of radiation from the hot gas and the inward pull of the gravity of the black hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;For most of the time we&#8217;ve been looking at this object, it has been growing rapidly,&#8221; Guillochon said. &#8220;This tells us something unusual&#8212;like a star twice as heavy as our Sun&#8212;is being fed into the black hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>This TDE may help answer the question as to how supermassive black holes in the early universe grow. If supermassive black holes can grow from TDEs or other means faster than the Eddington limit, this could explain how supermassive black holes were able to reach masses about a billion times higher than the sun when the universe was only about a billion years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;This event shows that black holes really can grow at extraordinarily high rates,&#8221; said co-author Stefanie Komossa of QianNan Normal University for Nationalities in Duyun City, China. &#8220;This may help understand how precocious black holes came to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on the modeling by the researchers, the black hole&#8217;s feeding supply should be significantly reduced in the next decade. This would result in XJ1500+0154 fading in x-ray brightness over the next several years.</p>

His new book (above) was just published in January.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Acclaimed writer and UC Santa Cruz alumnus <strong>Lawrence Weschler</strong> will join Academy Award-winning sound and film editor <strong>Walter Murch</strong>, and noted campus astronomer <strong>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</strong>, for <em>Waves Passing in the Night: Astrophysics, Harmony, and Boundaries</em>, on February 13, at 7 p.m., in the Music Center Recital Hall.<br/>
 <br/>
 The occasion is a conversation on astrophysics, acoustics, and disciplinary boundaries celebrating Weschler&#8217;s brand new book, <em>Waves Passing in the Night: Walter Murch in the Land of the Astrophysicists</em>, just published by Bloomsbury, USA.<br/>
 <br/>
 The book profiles Murch, a film legend and amateur astrophysicist who is well-known for his work on such classic films as <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, <em>The Godfather</em> trilogy, and <em>The English Patient</em>. <br/>
 <br/>
 It focuses on Murch&#8217;s passion for astrophysics, in particular the rehabilitation of Titius-Bode, a long abandoned 18th century theory regarding the patterns by which planets and moons array themselves in gravitational systems across the universe. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;An amateur scientist investigates oddly musical mysteries in the motion of the planets in this scintillating true-astronomy saga,&#8221; noted a review by <em>Publishers Weekly</em>. &#8220;Weschler remains sympathetic to both sides in this debate between an inspired novice and skeptical pros, expanding it into a fascinating lesson on the nature of scientific understanding and the ways people seek it.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 Or as film director Errol Morris described it: &#8220;An inviting portrait of an admirable and accomplished man. We come to see science as a closed club, science as abstruse and narrow, science as caste. But Weschler allows that it could be the other way around, too--science as protector of truth and progress, science as guardian against kooks.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;What began as an exploration of a 'far out' but relatable idea from a 'far out' but relatable guy has become instead a study of the praxis of science,&#8221; adds Morris. &#8221;Weschler leaves us pondering how firmly we know what we think we know.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Weschler graduated from Cowell College in 1972, where he studied Philosophy and Western Civilization. A critic, journalist, and author, he was a staff writer at the <em>New Yorker</em> for more than 20 years. <br/>
 <br/>
 Weschler&#8217;s books include <em>Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder</em>, for which he was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award; <em>Boggs: A Comedy of Values</em>; and <em>Everything That Rises</em>, which received the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism. <br/>
 <br/>
 This event is part of the UC Santa Cruz Original Thinkers series and is sponsored by Cowell College, the Institute for Humanities Research, the Film &amp; Digital Media Department and the Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Department at UC Santa Cruz. <br/>

<p>Tromp, vice provost at Arizona State University&#8217;s West Campus and a professor of English and women and gender studies, will arrive on campus June 1. Her appointment has been approved by UC President Janet Napolitano and will be finalized subject to the completion of her faculty appointment.</p>
<p>You can read more about Marlene&#8217;s background in the <a href="cpevc-tromp.xml">public announcement released</a> today by our news office. In a competitive field of highly qualified candidates, Marlene&#8217;s commitment to excellence stood out. She understands and appreciates the culture of UC Santa Cruz. She embraces our innovative spirit, values the role of faculty consultation in effective shared governance, and is committed to diversity and to making educational opportunities available to all.</p>
<p>Marlene is a renowned scholar with broad interests and an inquiring, open mind. She started college planning to become a doctor but switched gears to study literature; she is an engaged participant in the world around her (she took time off during her graduate career to work as a community activist). She is the author of two books: <em>Altered States: Sex, Nation, Drugs, and Self-Transformation in Victorian Spiritualism</em> and <em>The Private Rod: Sexual Violence, Marriage, and the Law in Victorian England</em>. Indeed, she has gotten to know our campus over the years as a frequent attendee of our annual summer Dickens Universe conference.</p>
<p>Finally, Marlene&#8217;s energy and enthusiasm is infectious. In her current role as vice provost of ASU&#8217;s West Campus, she has been a strong voice for faculty and students, advocating on their behalf within the larger Arizona State University system. As a first-generation college graduate, she appreciates firsthand the challenges facing students who are the first in their family to pursue a four-year degree.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with Marlene to move this campus forward, pursuing goals that will foster our core mission of teaching, research, and public service.</p>
<p>I want to thank members of the search committee, chaired by Physical and Biological Sciences Dean Paul Koch, for their service. I am extremely pleased with the outcome of this search.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a9206018072701752a34ca39800b6a9"><name>performance-update-appraisal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pay for Performance Update Appraisal Period will remain July 1 – June 30</title><summary>We are remaining on the current cycle of July 1 – June 30.</summary><start-date>1486368000000</start-date><display-name>Pay for Performance Update Appraisal Period will remain July 1 – June 30</display-name><path>/2017/02/performance-update-appraisal</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/performance-update-appraisal</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1486504460418</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1486504490403</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In December, 2016 SHR communicated the intention to use a truncated 2016/17 performance appraisal period of nine months (ending on March 31) as part of a transition to a different twelve-month cycle.&#160; We have reconsidered this idea based on feedback from several campus constituencies.

<span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A few points to stress regarding the topic of performance regardless of the cycle periods:</span></p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Managers and supervisors are encouraged to work with their team members to develop goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART goals).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;&#160; &#160; Managers and supervisors are encouraged to have frequent and candid conversations (at least monthly) with their team members about their job performance. This way the end-of-year review contains no surprises and is more of a summary of the previous conversations; and should take much less time to prepare.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">To obtain additional campus input from staff, a brief survey will be issued soon regarding possible changes to the performance rating scales and the appraisal forms.&#160;</span></p>

<p><strong>Friday, April 7 - Saturday, April 15, excluding Sunday, April 9, 2017.</strong><br/>
This annual event provides an opportunity for admitted students and their families to visit the campus and learn more about how UC Santa Cruz might be a good fit.</p>
<p>Admissions is also continuing to partner with <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/visit/sio/index.html">student-initiated outreach efforts</a>; student organizations play an important role in reaching out to admitted students and welcoming them to the campus. The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2017/01/taking-ucsc-home.html">Taking UCSC Home program</a> also continues again this year, allowing currently enrolled students to go back to their high schools or community colleges and speak first-hand about their UCSC experience.</p>
<p>We expect over 7,000 visitors in the next few months, including many who will travel from another state or another country, and will be curious about academic opportunities and university life. Some of our guests may ask you questions as they tour the campus, and your helpfulness (and patience) will affirm the positive qualities and character of the UCSC community. And when you happen upon individuals or groups that seem lost, I'd appreciate your help in pointing them in the right direction.</p>
<p>We'll begin notifying students of their admission beginning March 15, but in the meantime, if you have questions about these efforts, or if you see areas around campus that need attention, please contact Assistant Director Beatrice Atkinson-Myers in Admissions (<a href="mailto:beatrice@ucsc.edu">beatrice@ucsc.edu</a> or 459-2352) and she will work with the appropriate unit(s) to help create the best possible experience for our visitors. For more information, a complete outline of <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/yield.html">campus spring yield events</a> is available online.</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your commitment and continued partnership in yielding the best students for this fall's incoming class!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC

<p>On New Year&#8217;s Eve, a satellite tag on a 1,200-pound female elephant seal named Phyllis fell silent.</p>
<p>Phyllis&#8212;named after the late Phyllis Sooy, a go-getter philanthropist from South Carolina&#8212;had set a record for swimming past the International Date Line and&#160;almost to Japan on her eight-month foraging journey. Then, 683 miles from home on&#160;her return trip to A&#241;o Nuevo, Phyllis stopped transmitting her location.</p>
<p>About 15 percent of tagged elephant seals die or are eaten by predators on their annual feeding adventure, according to UC Santa Cruz Ph.D. student Rachel Holser.</p>
<p>Researchers&#8217; hearts sank.</p>
<p>But on Jan. 14, an observer spotted Phyllis resting in a rocky cove at A&#241;o Nuevo State Park. Five days later, Phyllis gave birth to a healthy-looking baby boy.</p>
<p>Phyllis&#8217;s landing meant the eight-year-old seal had swum about 7,400 miles, longer than any elephant seal recorded over two decades. The average female elephant seal logs just over 4,000 miles on feeding trips.</p>
<p>Once the data is recovered from Phyllis&#8217;s satellite tag (which turned out to have a dead battery), the actual miles she covered may be closer to 10,000, Holser noted, since these animals seldom swim in a straight line and spend lots of time diving to find food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phyllis,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Dan Costa, &#8220;turned out to be an amazing seal.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting is that, besides Phyllis, three other tagged female elephant seals also outdid their more average sisterhood during the most current foraging trip.</p>
<p>Claudia, Mary, and Sheila all recorded swims that took them past the International Date Line. In addition, Sheila embarked on a journey that is somewhat unusual for a female elephant seal. Instead of heading into the Pacific, where the majority of female elephant seals go, Sheila went toward the Aleutian Islands, where male elephant seals typically travel&#8212;and then proceeded to swim farther west than any of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her data,&#8221; said Holser, &#8220;is pretty cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the question for UC Santa Cruz researchers is: Why did 4 of the 20 tagged seals swim unusually far this year?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a question that UC Santa Cruz is in a unique place to ask and to answer, according to Costa.</p>
<p>Usually, animal studies last only about three or four years, but UC Santa Cruz has been tracking elephant seals for about two decades and has compiled what is arguably the largest marine mammal diving and tracking record on the planet.</p>
<p>Because of the breadth of its information, &#8220;we can now say those four animals did something unusual,&#8221; Costa said, &#8220;but is that a new normal or is this just an extreme year?&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the next months, researchers will be analyzing data, including ocean temperature, salinity, and depth measurements that some of the seals&#8217; tracking devices recorded, in hopes of discovering whether the animals&#8217; long swims were an anomaly or were in response to climate change.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, there was something in the four seals&#8217; personalities that made them long-distance champions. In fact, seal personality is also one of the topics currently being studied at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;a research project undertaken by Holser, who, coincidentally, was the recipient of grant from a $200,000 graduate fellowship endowment Phyllis Sooy's widower, Steve Sooy, had established earlier.</p>
<p>For Steve Sooy, it was an emotional moment when he accompanied Holser and Costa on a trip to observe Phyllis and her new pup.</p>
<p>His late wife, Sooy said, was one of those people who not only loved the couple&#8217;s annual long trips across country to visit family and allow Steve to work as a docent at A&#241;o Nuevo State Park, but she also had a lead foot when it came to her own driving.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t describe exactly what I felt,&#8221; Steve said of seeing Phyllis the seal for the first time. &#8220;But there was a completeness of saying, &#8216;Hey kid, you did a good job.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; he said, his voice breaking slightly, &#8220;a sweet moment.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/phyllis-the-seal-feature-story.html</url><title>The mighty Phyllis</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="24da6c1c8072701752a34ca31ad165f4"><name>summer-session</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>High-demand courses to be offered in summer session</title><summary>The focus for summer 2017 is to offer high-demand courses in small class sizes.

<p>The 2017 Summer Session courses and descriptions are now available at summer.ucsc.edu.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want students to know that summer can be part of their planning as early as winter quarter. Summer is an optional &#8216;fourth quarter&#8217; for students to fulfill degree requirements,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;Financial aid and discounted on-campus housing are available too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The focus for summer 2017 is to offer high-demand courses in small class sizes. There will be 20 online courses, up from 11 last summer, as well as more than 250 on-campus courses across 30 departments. The average class size in summer 2016 was 26 students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that staying in Santa Cruz is not an option for all students. By continuing to expand our online offerings, students who return home or work full time can continue to make degree progress,&#8221; Parikh said.</p>
<p>Courses offered will help fulfill general education, lower division, and upper division requirements. Other classes can help students dive deeper into a subject of interest. Summer session also includes classes not offered in fall, winter, spring like <em>Entrepreneurship Academy: Discovering and Launching a Business</em> (CRWN 90), <em>Women in the Bible</em> (STEV 36), and <em>Food Systems: Culture, Social Justice, Sustainability</em> (OAKS 167).</p>
<p>Enrollment opens to all students on May 1. Most courses run through two five-week sessions and a few are 8- and 10-week sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: June 26 to July 28</li>
<li>Session 2: July 31 to September. 1</li>
<li>8-week session: June 26 to August 18</li>
<li>10-week session: June 26 to September 1</li>
</ul>

<p>Blumenthal's appointment was announced Wednesday, Feb. 8, by California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who personally invited the campus leader to join the 29-member board.</p>
<p>"The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine is doing outstanding work, and I am delighted to join the board. CIRM support has advanced stem cell research at UC Santa Cruz and across the state," said Blumenthal. "Public support for this work remains strong, and I look forward to playing a role in securing the future of the institute."</p>
<p>Blumenthal was appointed to a six-year term on the board. A professor of astronomy and astrophysics, he said he looks forward to learning a lot more about stem cell research, the projects supported by CIRM, and the benefits to patients.</p>
<p>CIRM funds stem cell research at institutions and companies throughout California, and beyond, with the goal of speeding treatments to patients with unmet medical needs, including those suffering from heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. CIRM began funding scientists in 2006 and today is the world's largest institution dedicated to helping people by advancing human embryonic stem cell research.<br/>
<br/>
 UC Santa Cruz researchers across the disciplines have received support from CIRM, including those working in bioinformatics, neurobiology, developmental biology, and genetics. Even astronomers with expertise in adaptive optics for telescopes have been funded to work with electrical engineers and biologists on deep-tissue imaging techniques.<br/>
<br/>
 Among the highlights of campus support received over the past decade:<br/>
<br/>
 &#8226; A 2008 grant for $7.2 million to establish a <a href="https://stemcell.soe.ucsc.edu/research">stem cell research center</a>.<br/>
 &#8226; A 2014 grant to run the data coordination and management program of the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/stem-cell-genomics.html">Center of Excellence in Stem Cell Genomics</a><br/>
 &#8226; A $2.2 million grant in 2009 to fund a program to train stem cell scientists</p>
<p>Jonathan Thomas, chair of the CIRM board said, "We are honored to have someone with Dr. Blumenthal&#8217;s experience and expertise join the board. As Chancellor at UCSC, he has demonstrated a clear commitment to advancing world-class research and earned a reputation as a bold and visionary leader. We look forward to seeing those qualities in action to help advance CIRM&#8217;s mission."</p>

<p>Coedited by Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, and Harold Mooney, professor of environmental biology at Stanford University, <em>Ecosystems of California</em> received the PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences &amp; Mathematics, as well as the Environmental Sciences award.</p>
<p>The book provides an integrated assessment of each major ecosystem type in California&#8212;its distribution, structure, function, and management. A comprehensive synthesis of our knowledge about this biologically diverse state, <em>Ecosystems of California</em> covers the state from oceans to mountaintops using multiple lenses: past and present, flora and fauna, aquatic and terrestrial, natural and managed. Contributors to the book include the leading experts on each ecosystem and on topics such as climate, fire, and land use.</p>
<p>The result, said Zavaleta, is the textbook she wished she had when she was a Stanford undergraduate more than 20 years ago. At the time, there wasn't a book that looked systematically at the history, dynamics, and conservation of California ecosystems. The 2017 PROSE Awards recognize how extraordinarily well <em>Ecosystems of California</em> has filled that gap.</p>
<p>Since 1976, the PROSE Awards have been organized by the Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association of American Publishers (AAP) to bring attention to distinguished books, journals, and electronic content. The awards are judged by an independent, 20-person panel of peer editors, publishers, and librarians.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/ecosystems-california.html</url><title>'Ecosystems of California' documents one of Earth's most biodiverse places</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="293fb0698072701752a34ca303da6f8c"><name>school-lunch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>School lunch programs offer healthier, tastier fare</title><summary>Across the state, schoolchildren are enjoying healthier, more nutritious school lunches thanks to a wave of support from school districts, the University of California, and a host of organizations that includes UC Santa Cruz-based Life Lab.</summary><keywords>UCOP, global food, school lunch, life lab, CASFS</keywords><start-date>1486713600000</start-date><display-name>school-lunch</display-name><path>/2017/02/school-lunch</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/school-lunch</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1486750722778</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1486750902107</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/school-lunch.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/school-lunch.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>school-lunch.jpg</name><file-size>68120</file-size><width>686</width><height>457</height></image><image-alt>Photo of smiling elementary school children with apples</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The National School Lunch Program serves lunch to more than 30 million students a day.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Across the state, schoolchildren are enjoying healthier, more nutritious school lunches thanks to a wave of support from school districts, the University of California, and a host of organizations that includes UC Santa Cruz-based Life Lab.<br/>

<p>In spite of the rainy weather, the convocation drew a large and enthusiastic crowd to Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. Students from Seaside, Marina and other area high schools, were out in force.</p>
<p>At various times in his keynote address, Jealous, who led and helped revitalize the NAACP during his tenure from 2008 to 2012, invoked the events of September, 1663, in Gloucester County, Virginia, when slaves and indentured servants plotted to revolt against the tobacco planters who were exploiting them.</p>
<p>The rebellion failed, but Jealous urged the audience to remember this time when oppressed people reached across ethnic lines to fight back, before those in power sowed discord and division between black and white members of the underclass.</p>
<p>Comparing politics to physics, Jealous told the audience, which included his parents as well as his 100-year-old grandmother, a grandchild of former slaves, that &#8220;for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, and objects in motion eventually return to their original state.&#8221;</p>
<p>In America, he added, it is important to remember that this &#8216;original state&#8217; was not hate and division between black and white. This animus, he said, did not come from within but was imposed from above, by the people who stood to gain from such divisions.</p>
<p>Jealous also offered many examples of 21st century coalitions, movements or actions in which ethnic divisions, or even political affiliations, were irrelevant.</p>
<p>He spoke of the time he introduced a speech by Senator Bernie Sanders, deep in the heart of the Ozarks, where the overwhelmingly white audience applauded loudly at the same sections of the speech that roused mostly African American audiences in large Midwestern cities, including Sanders&#8217; call for an end to police shootings of unarmed African Americans.</p>
<p>Jealous also invoked prison reform, and how social justice and fiscal responsibility can lead to coalitions in the &#8220;activist wings&#8221; of either party. &#8220;This is what gives me hope,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is the true lesson of what we saw in a year of disruptive politics when the most important thing, in either party, was the need to help working people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his closing remarks, Jealous urged African Americans and other groups to embrace their own power and wield it at the ballot box. He invoked the large numbers of black voters in key states where Republicans won in November 2016. In every example he pointed out, the number of unregistered black voters was far greater than the Republican margin of victory.</p>
<p>&#8221;We can be hopeful because we have what it takes to win right now,&#8221; Jealous said. &#8220;We can make the future come faster. We simply have to decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jealous is currently a partner at Kapor Capital, investing in companies with positive social impact. He is part of a longstanding tradition of powerful speakers at the convocation. Over the years, this event has drawn such luminaries as Alicia Garza, Angela Davis, Alice Walker, Nikki Giovanni, Yolanda King, Maxine Waters, Julian Bond, Van Jones, Anna Deavere Smith, Bell Hooks, and Cornel West.</p>
<p>Another emotional highlight was a strong statement of support from Chancellor George Blumenthal for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s roughly 400 undocumented students, who are feeling &#8220;particularly vulnerable&#8221; under the new administration, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have told them that UC Santa Cruz as a campus, and the University of California as a whole, stand with them, their families, and their communities,&#8221; Blumenthal said to loud applause. &#8220;Our commitment to them is steadfast. We will protect their privacy and civil rights. Our police will not partner with any government agencies to enforce federal immigration law. We will not contact, detain or arrest anyone on the basis of their immigration status.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to admit undocumented students,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;We will not cooperate with any federal registry based on religion, national origin, race or sexual orientation. This is the way forward: banding together, supporting one another, and finding our voices. I believe Dr. King would be proud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another highlight was the announcement of the Tony Hill Award, named for a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. &#160;Hill died in 2007 at age 62.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s winner is <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/doron-comerchero-tony-hill-award-honoree-2017.html">Doron Comerchero, the visionary founder of FoodWhat,</a> a nonprofit that has been using sustainable farming and healthy food to turn around the lives of impoverished and struggling youth since 2007. During his remarks, Comerchero sent out some &#8220;big love&#8221; to all the youth who had benefitted from the organization.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this organization with the funny name?&#8221; he said. &#8220;FoodWhat Is a youth empowerment and justice organization created to challenge inequities and serve high school students with the fewest resources. It gives them a safe space to step into their power and amplify their voices. He then led the audience in a mighty rallying cry of &#8220;FOOD, WHAT?!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a5e3c898072701752a34ca319f9830c"><name>doron-comerchero-tony-hill-award-honoree-2017</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Planting seeds, growing confidence</title><summary>Innovative nonprofit founder, sustainable farmer and youth advocate Doron Comerchero is this year’s Tony Hill Award winner&#13;

<p>For the past decade, he and his staff have worked hard to provide them with healthy food, meaningful work, and a supportive community.</p>
<p>Now, his labors, outreach, and vision are getting the recognition they deserve. Comerchero, 40, is the ninth recipient of the annual Tony Hill Award, a prestigious honor that is given to bridge-builders and community organizers who embody the spirit of the late social activist Tony Hill.</p>
<p>Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62.</p>
<p>Comerchero received this honor during the 33<sup>rd</sup> annual <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/ben-jealous-mlk-coverage-2017.html">Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation ceremony</a> in downtown Santa Cruz on Thursday.</p>
<p>Melanie Stern, Tony Hill's widow and a member of the award selection committee, said that America needs people like Comerchero more than ever these days.&#160; &#8220;We find ourselves in very challenging times,&#8221; Stern said. &#8220;Doron Comerchero's FoodWhat is more of what we need: innovative solutions, sustainability, passion, and hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stern also praised Comerchero&#8217;s unique approach to social justice issues. &#8220;FoodWhat provides opportunities for young people to discover more about themselves through their connection with the land, through fostering new capabilities and hope for the future,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was incredible to receive the call from Melanie,&#8221; said Comerchero in an interview before the convocation. &#8220;I felt like our decade of work, serving youth from a place of equity and empowerment, was really being seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nonprofit has a distinctive and instantly recognizable logo, featuring a carrot, a tomato, and the words &#8220;FOOD WHAT?!&#8221; in oversized letters. This organization has deep roots at UC Santa Cruz. Comerchero was an apprentice with the campus&#8217;s Center For Agroeceology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems in 2004, and stayed on for a second year in 2005.&#160;</p>
<p>His nonprofit now operates in two locations&#8212;on a small parcel of land at the UC Santa Cruz Farm, and at another parcel at Farm Discovery at Live Earth Farm on Green Valley Road in Watsonville.</p>
<p>The convocation crowd, including a large contingent of youth who have worked with the nonprofit, gave him a rousing welcome as he approached the podium.&#160; Comerchero noted that 2007, the year that Tony Hill died, was also the year his organization launched. &#8220;Somewhere I trust in my heart that Tony has been sharing his spirit, his passion and his wisdom with us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we empower youth?&#8221; said Comerchero. &#8220;The answer is we don&#8217;t. Our job, as staff, is to create an environment for youth to experience their own success.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that empowerment meant something different to each young participant. &#8220;This gives them a place to heal from past traumas, to see that they are not their past experiences, to explore their identities that many have not had the space to do so at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The food grown on-site at FoodWhat is prepared and consumed in daily healthy meals by youth participants. Shares of youth-grown produce grown goes home with the youth and their families, and is used to support youth-run low-income farm stands in both sides of the county.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is part of the magic,&#8221; Comerchero said. &#8220;Many youth at FoodWhat experience radical diet change, from consuming junk food and soda to fresh fruit and vegetables.&#160; And this is just one part of their incredible personal growth and transformation from their time at FoodWhat.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3873aef38072701752a34ca32dc21de3"><name>hires-data-release</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomy team releases planet-search data, finds more than 100 candidates</title><summary>The HIRES spectrometer, designed and built by UCSC astronomer Steven Vogt, has been a planet-hunting workhorse for over two decades.</summary><keywords>Steven Vogt, Steve Vogt, HIRES, exoplanets</keywords><start-date>1487008800000</start-date><display-name>Astronomy team releases planet-search data, finds more than 100 candidates</display-name><path>/2017/02/hires-data-release</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/hires-data-release</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1487005788073</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487959773632</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/vogt-butler-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/vogt-butler-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vogt-butler-410.jpg</name><display-name>vogt-butler-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>120063</file-size><width>410</width><height>331</height></image><image-alt>Steve Vogt &amp; Paul Butler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/vogt-butler-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/vogt-butler-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>vogt-butler-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>vogt-butler-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>41131</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Steve Vogt &amp; Paul Butler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>UCSC astronomer Steve Vogt (foreground) with collaborator Paul Butler at the W.

By making the data public, the team is offering unprecedented access to one of the best exoplanet searches in the world.</p>
<p>The data were gathered as part of a two-decade planet-hunting program using a spectrometer called HIRES, built by UC Santa Cruz astronomer Steven Vogt and mounted on the 10-meter Keck-I telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii.</p>
<p>"HIRES was not specifically optimized to do this type of exoplanet detective work, but has turned out to be a workhorse instrument of the field," said Vogt, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics. "I am very happy to contribute to science that is fundamentally changing how we view ourselves in the universe."</p>
<p>The data compilation, available on the team's <a href="http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/ebps/data/">web site</a>, includes almost 61,000 individual measurements made on more than 1,600 stars. An initial analysis of the data revealed more than 100 potential exoplanets, including one orbiting the fourth-closest star to our own solar system. The researchers presented their findings in a paper accepted for publication in the <em>Astronomical Journal</em> and <a href="http://home.dtm.ciw.edu/ebps/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Keck_planet_search.pdf">available online</a>.</p>
<p>"This paper and data release represents a good chunk of my life work," said lead author Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution for Science, one of the researchers who helped jumpstart the field of exoplanet science.</p>
<p><strong>Wobbly stars</strong></p>
<p>The radial velocity method is one of the most successful techniques for finding and confirming planets. It takes advantage of the fact that, in addition to a planet being influenced by the gravity of the star it orbits, the planet&#8217;s gravity also affects the star. Astronomers are able to use sophisticated tools to detect the tiny wobble the planet induces as its gravity tugs on the star.</p>
<p>As the HIRES survey moves into its third decade, the team members decided it was time to clean house. With so much data at hand and a limited amount of time, they recognized that more exoplanets would be found by sharing their catalog with the exoplanet community.</p>
<p>Before giving everyone the keys to their exoplanet-finder, however, the team took it out for a spin themselves. Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire led a sophisticated statistical analysis of the large data set to tease out the periodic signals most likely to be planets.</p>
<p>"We were very conservative in this paper about what counts as an exoplanet candidate and what does not," Tuomi explained, "and even with our stringent criteria, we found over 100 new likely planet candidates."</p>
<p>One of these probable planets is around a star called GJ 411, also known as Lalande 21185. It is the fourth-closest star to our own sun and has only about 40 percent of the sun's mass. The planet has a very short orbital period of just under 10 days, so it is no Earth-twin. However, GJ 411b continues a trend that has been seen in the overall population of detected exoplanets: The smallest planets are found around the smallest stars.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Open source</strong></p>
<p>An open-source software package for analyzing exoplanet data (<a href="http://www.stefanom.org/systemic/">Systemic Console</a>) was developed at UC Santa Cruz by team member Greg Laughlin and his students, primarily Stefano Meschiari. "One of our key goals in this paper is to democratize the search for planets," explained Laughlin, now at Yale University. "Anyone can download the velocities published on our website and use the open-source Systemic software package and try fitting planets from the data."</p>
<p>The team is hoping their decision will lead to a flurry of new science as astronomers around the globe combine the HIRES data with their own existing observations or mount new observing campaigns to follow up on potential signals. The catalog release is part of a growing trend in exoplanet science to broaden the audience and discovery space, which has emerged in part to handle the follow-up of planets discovered by NASA's <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html">Kepler and K2</a> missions.</p>
<p>"I think this paper sets a precedent for how the community can collaborate on exoplanet detection and follow-up, moving forward," said team member Johanna Teske of the Carnegie Institution for Science. "With NASA's <a href="https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TESS</a> mission on the horizon, which is expected to detect 1,000-plus planets orbiting bright, nearby stars, exoplanet scientists will soon have a whole new pool of planets to follow up."</p>
<p>"The best way to advance the field and further our understanding of what these planets are made out of is to harness the abilities of a variety of precision radial velocity instruments and deploy them in concert. But that will require some big teams to break from tradition and start leading serious cooperative efforts," added team member Jennifer Burt, who earned her Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz last year and is now at MIT. &#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="396f50598072701752a34ca39115b633"><name>policy-review-drones</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal review of proposed systemwide policy on unmanned aircraft systems</title><summary>The policy is to establish minimum standards for the safe use and operation of UAS and Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS), including drones and model aircraft, on any university location or at any authorized university activity.</summary><keywords>drones, policy, feedback</keywords><start-date>1487005200000</start-date><display-name>Policy </display-name><path>/2017/02/policy-review-drones</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/policy-review-drones</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1487022279211</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487096216050</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Office of the President invites comments on a proposed new policy for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).

 <br/>
 The two-hour documentary is about the increasingly necessary conversation taking place in homes and communities, between parents of color and their children, about how to behave if they are ever stopped by the police.<br/>
 <br/>
 <em>The Talk</em> presents six&#160;personal stories to illustrate the issue from multiple points of view. Filmed in communities across the country, the stories include interviews with police, academics, community activists, and family members. <br/>
 <br/>
 Airing in the wake of shootings of unarmed men of color such as Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, the documentary also features interviews with <strong>Kenya Barris</strong>, creator of the Peabody Award-winning <em>ABC</em> series <em>black-ish</em>; musician/activist <strong>Nas</strong>; actor/director <strong>Rosie Perez</strong>, screenwriter/producer <strong>John Singleton</strong>; <em>New York Times</em> columnist <strong>Charles Blow</strong>, and <strong>Samaria Rice</strong>, mother of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy killed by the Cleveland police in a local park. <br/>
 <br/>
 Each story is produced by a different filmmaker to ensure that diverse perspectives are presented. The segment that Taylor created is titled <em>Message to Zaire</em>.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It&#8217;s about an Afro Latino Muslim family in Oakland and their little boy who wants to be a police officer,&#8221; said Taylor. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I was commissioned to do the piece by Latino Public Broadcasting for <em>WNET</em>, and brought my close colleague and frequent collaborator Mustafa Davis on board to co-produce it with me this past fall.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Taylor joined the Film and Digital Media Department at UC Santa Cruz in 2014. She is an award-winning documentary producer and director of character-based, documentary films--often focusing on youth, Latinos, and life in communities affected by poverty, surveillance, the correctional system, and state-sponsored violence.<br/>
 <br/>
 The overall project is directed by Academy Award nominee and multiple Emmy Award-winning filmmaker Sam Pollard, and produced by Academy Award nominee Julie Anderson.<br/>
 <br/>
 At last July&#8217;s Television Critics Association summer press tour in Los Angeles to discuss the upcoming documentary, the filmmakers were joined onstage by Samaria Rice, whose son was 12-years-old when he was killed by the Cleveland police while playing with a toy gun in a local park.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The conversation that needs to be held in America is about racism,&#8221; Rice noted. &#8220;It can be uncomfortable. It needs to happen or America is just going to crumble right in front of your eyes.&#8221; <br/>

it</article-subhead><article-text><p>Finding information about videogames can now be a game in itself, thanks to researchers at the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a>. They created <a href="http://gamespace.io">GameSpace</a>, a playable visualization of 16,000 videogames grouped according to common features and displayed in 3-dimensional space like a vast galaxy of games available for exploration.</p>
<p>"It takes the playful pleasure of spatial navigation that people are familiar with from games, with the same kinds of controls and feedback, and applies it to the exploration of information about games," said Noah Wardrip-Fruin, professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A user flying through GameSpace will encounter, for example, a large cluster of racing games, and can then investigate individual games or look nearby to find related kinds of games. For each game, the user can read its Wikipedia article or watch YouTube videos of gameplay without having to leave the space.</p>
<p>Released on February 14, GameSpace is available at <a href="http://gamespace.io">gamespace.io</a>. UCSC computer science graduate students James Ryan and Eric Kaltman led the development of GameSpace, with Wardrip-Fruin and Michael Mateas, professor and chair of computational media, as their primary advisers. Undergraduates Taylor Owen-Milner and Andrew Max Fisher carried out much of the development work.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Relatedness scores</strong></p>
<p>The GameSpace visualization is based on an analysis of all the articles about specific games found on <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> (excluding incomplete entries known as "stubs"). The researchers used a natural language processing technique called "latent semantic analysis" to analyze the game descriptions and compute relatedness scores. Those scores were then used to determine the position of each game within the 3-dimensional "galaxy" of GameSpace.</p>
<p>"We ended up with clusters that actually reflect important things about the games, with groups of games that play similarly, or that have similar cultural reactions to them, or were made by the same well-known game designer," Wardrip-Fruin said.</p>
<p>Ryan added that GameSpace will be a living, growing visualization. Each night, the system will automatically comb Wikipedia in search of new videogame articles that have appeared since the last update; if it finds new articles, it will process them to add new games into the model. "If a user's favorite game isn't in GameSpace, she can author a Wikipedia article for it (or expand its existing stub article) and it will appear in the visualization the next day," he said.</p>
<p>GameSpace is part of a larger project, the <a href="https://gamecip.soe.ucsc.edu/">Game Metadata and Citation Project (GAMECIP)</a>, funded by the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a>. GAMECIP is a multi-year joint initiative involving the UC Santa Cruz Library, UCSC Center for Games and Playable Media, and Stanford University Library to improve how libraries and other institutions catalog games, as well as game search and citation practices.</p>
<p>"The release of GameSpace is another step in helping people discover games they might care about," said Wardrip-Fruin. "We're also working on guidelines for citation of games, and we developed guidelines for cataloging games that have been widely adopted."</p>
<p>GameSpace builds on two earlier tools the team developed for finding games, called <a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gamenet">GameNet</a> and <a href="http://gamecip-projects.soe.ucsc.edu/gamesage">GameSage</a>. Only 12,000 games were in the network developed for those tools, which proved to be useful but did not give a good sense of the shape and structure of the underlying model, Wardrip-Fruin said. Now, in addition to having more games, GameSpace provides a tool that people might interact with for fun and learn something about games on the side.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="429392868072701752a34ca33925ae03"><name>hummingbird-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hummingbird Day at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is Saturday, March 4</title><summary>Hummingbird Day is a family-oriented event celebrating one of nature’s vibrant aerial acrobats, the hummingbird.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, UCSC Arboretum</keywords><start-date>1487145600000</start-date><display-name>Hummingbird Day at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum is Saturday, March 4</display-name><path>/2017/02/hummingbird-day</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/hummingbird-day</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1487175650622</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487176362940</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/hummingbird-day.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/hummingbird-day.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hummingbird-day.jpg</name><display-name>hummingbird-day.jpg</display-name><file-size>76686</file-size><width>400</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>hummingbird day poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/hummingbird-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/hummingbird-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hummingbird-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hummingbird-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17228</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>hummingbird in flight</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/hummingbird-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/hummingbird-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hummingbird-400.jpg</name><display-name>hummingbird-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>58817</file-size><width>400</width><height>277</height></image><image-alt>hummingbird at a flower</image-alt><image-caption><p>Hummingbirds are attracted to the Arboretum's many flowering plants.

<p>&#8220;America is changing,&#8221; opens Benner in <a href="https://everettprogram.app.box.com/s/fx99v7pj2c1gg4to5nd9sxmeyw254qf8">&#8220;Diversity and Inclusion for the 21st Century Economy: An Imperative for Chambers of Commerce,&#8221;</a> a paper co-authored with longterm collaborator Manuel Pastor, a UCSC alumnus and former UCSC professor now with the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>The face of small business is shifting. From 2007&#8211;2012, Latino-owned businesses in the U.S. grew by 34.5 percent and African American-owned enterprises grew by 46.3 percent. A quarter of all new businesses were started by immigrants.</p>
<p>What is now a trend will soon become the norm. As soon as 2040, 49 percent of the U.S. workers will be African American, Latino, Asian Pacific Islander, Native American, and self-identified multiracial. By 2050, America is expected to become majority-minority, a demographic shift driven by natural growth, not immigration.</p>
<p>For business leaders and metropolitan chambers of commerce, a &#8220;business as usual&#8221; approach is no longer enough, Benner and Pastor say.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lagging behind demographic change is stark income equality and exclusion. Job growth is sluggish. Wages are stagnant. Education is fragmenting. The nation&#8217;s poor are geographically concentrating.</p>
<p>As Benner and Pastor show, it&#8217;s hurting business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chambers can no longer think of inclusion as an afterthought,&#8221; Benner says, pointing to his <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/benner-book.html">previous research</a> that shows cities that foster education and economic equity fare better fiscally.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should instead recognize that regions that are more equal and more integrated&#8212;across income, race, gender, and place&#8212;have better economic performance, on average, than those regions that are more unequal and more divided,&#8221; adds Benner, the Dorothy E. Everett Global Information and Social Entrepreneurship Chair and executive director of the <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/">Everett Program</a>.</p>
<p>But this is increasingly difficult for business leaders and chambers. As America grows more diverse, people are increasingly sorting themselves by ideological and political beliefs. For example, in 1992, only 20 percent of American voters lived in a county where a presidential candidate won by a landslide. In 2016, it was a staggering 57 percent.</p>
<p>This homogenous sorting is also reflected in the media where information is filtered algorithmically along partisan lines. Communication is now so customized that &#8220;unwanted&#8221; news gets filtered out without audiences knowing.</p>
<p>Facts&#8212;which Benner notes are vital to policy-making&#8212;are no longer basic and generally agreed upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unchallenged by opposing perspectives, we are increasingly drifting apart at exactly the moment in which we need to know and grow together,&#8221; Benner says.</p>
<p>But these difficulties also provide opportunities for chambers.</p>
<p>As business leaders, chambers are uniquely positioned to connect community and cultivate collaboration. They are also seasoned at relationship building and have a strong sense of roots in the region.</p>
<p>For example, Benner and Pastor point to Great Reading, PA, where the county chamber created a new initiative where women from diverse backgrounds can network with each other through a leadership series, in a mentorship program, and in regular roundtables that address the challenges faced by female business owners. They also offer a Latina focused meeting as well.</p>
<p>Another example Benner and Pastor offer is in South Carolina where the Greenville Chamber launched the Minority Business Resource Collaborative to support minority businesses upstate. The group&#8217;s goal is to leverage the power as a collective by sharing knowledge and skills with the aspiration for economic development, business growth, job creation, and wealth creation.</p>
<p>In sum, chambers must play a civic role as well as an economic one if they are to remain relevant to a changing entrepreneurial landscape.</p>
<p>But diversity work is hard, Benner and Pastor warn.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work is not for the faint-of-heart. A bumpy process is to be expected as making changes to accommodate our inevitable demographic and economic shifts is not easy and can involve substantial conflict,&#8221; they say.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4374fed38072701752a34ca3f7146816"><name>career-tracks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Upcoming Career Tracks Support Events</title><start-date>1486713600000</start-date><display-name>Upcoming Career Tracks Support Events</display-name><path>/2017/02/career-tracks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/career-tracks</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1487190423589</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487192164895</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Career Tracks goes live!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Career Tracks Quick Overview</strong></p>
<p>The goal of Career Tracks is to group jobs into more clearly defined families and functions that better align with comparable jobs in other UC locations and in the external labor market. The vision is to implement Career Tracks at all UC campuses and medical centers over the next few years.</p>
<p>Senior Management Group, academics, represented staff, and students are not affected. Career Tracks will not affect job duties or function, working ("business card") title or current base pay. Career Tracks has replaced UC's outdated job classification framework with a market-based system for all non represented employees.</p>
<p>Information will be posted as dates are added at the News &amp; Events page on the Staff HR Career Tracks website.</p>

<p>That means no more bleary-eyed 6:30 a.m. practices that start in the dark and end with rushed departures for 8 a.m. classes and no more late-night student carpools to off-campus practice sites in Scotts Valley, Aptos, and Harvey West Park.</p>
<p>The lights turned on this month, thanks to a generous $190,000 donation by rugby alumnus George Kraw (1971), who played mostly &#8220;lock&#8221; and &#8220;break-away&#8221; on the <a href="../../2015/11/rugby-team-uc-santa-cruz.xml">first rugby team in 1967</a>&#8212;the same team that is credited with being the first to adopt the venerated Banana Slug as its mascot. There was also a whole lot of footwork by campus administrators, rugby coaches, and a donation by Baton Rouge, LA-based Boss Light Towers that made the project a reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty exciting and kind of unbelievable,&#8221; says Billy O&#8217;Driscoll, the rugby team captain who plays fly-half, a position similar to quarterback in American football. &#8220;The mindset right now is to make the post-season playoffs this year. That&#8217;s our goal right now and I think it&#8217;s an attainable goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Kraw, a Silicon Valley civil attorney, was hoping to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that a world-class university deserves a world-class rugby team and that requires lighted fields,&#8221; Kraw says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to trouble the Regents or the legislature of the state of California. They&#8217;re&#160;busy, busy, busy. So, I wrote a check.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kraw, who was on campus last year for a rugby reunion, said he was impressed not only with the team, but in players&#8217; commitment to shouldering the costs for the team during tight budget years. He asked what it would take to take the current team to the next level.</p>
<p>The answer was simple: more practice time. Until now it&#8217;s been nearly impossible to find time to practice all together due to complicated student schedules, field maintenance schedules, and too few hours of light in winter.</p>
<p>The 48 new lamps that stand 40-feet high from six mobile trailers are expected to surpass regulation lumens for night competitions and can be moved to accommodate other clubs, events, or emergencies. Directional shields around each 1,000-watt bulb minimize light pollution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am hopeful that this leads to string of league championships and victories over Berkeley and Stanford, if not home matches with Oxford, Paris-Sorbonne, and Tokyo&#8217;s Waseda universities,&#8221; Kraw says.</p>
<p>The new rugby practice schedule is 7&#8211;9 p.m., Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. The lights will also benefit the women&#8217;s rugby team and other athletic teams, if they choose to have night practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will have a huge impact on the ability of teams to improve and train and compete,&#8221; says Jeremy Sanford, an associate professor of Molecular, Cell and Development Biology who coaches men&#8217;s rugby along with head coach Robbie Bellue. &#8220;It will give us time to build the continuity we need to be competitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopefully the lights will draw people like a beacon to the team. &#8220;There are still a lot of people who don&#8217;t know rugby is a sport the campus is really good at.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team feels the alumni support behind them, O&#8217;Driscoll says.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of tradition in our club. The new lights add to feeling that &#8220;there&#8217;s a change in the wind for the team. We&#8217;re definitely getting our stride more. Everyone&#8217;s coming together.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="448cad8b8072701752a34ca3a0e0c40c"><name>humanities-grad-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz receives $191,000 grant to benefit grad students in humanities, arts, social sciences</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is one of five universities nationwide selected by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) to be part of its new University Initiative program.  </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, graduae division institute for humanities reearch</keywords><start-date>1487286600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz receives $191,000 grant to benefit grad students in humanities, arts, social sciences</display-name><path>/2017/02/humanities-grad-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/humanities-grad-grant</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1487208753201</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487286844097</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/ihr-banner-350.png</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/ihr-banner-350.png</link><site>news</site><name>ihr-banner-350.png</name><display-name>ihr-banner-350.png</display-name><file-size>201383</file-size><width>350</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz Institute for Humanities Research banner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/ihr-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/ihr-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>ihr-thumb.png</name><display-name>ihr-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>30263</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz Institute for Humanities Research banner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is one of five universities nationwide selected by the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) to be part of its new University Initiative program.&#160;</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to provide resources to develop new interdisciplinary programs that will strengthen the training of humanities, arts, and social science graduate students in preparing effective dissertational research proposals.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has received a $191,000 grant to support a new <em>SSRC Dissertation Proposal Development Program</em>, hosted by the Institute for Humanities Research in conjunction with the Division of Graduate Studies.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The program seeks to bridge a persistent gap between the university&#8217;s broad support of interdisciplinary scholarship and the ability of doctoral students to learn how to apply these approaches&#8212;particularly in the early stages of their graduate careers.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz's program will provide doctoral students with extra training and support at a critical transition point in their career--as they make the shift from coursework and exploratory research to independent, original research,&#8221; noted Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Tyrus Miller, the lead administrator for the new partnership.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is often a daunting change, and there are no simple road-maps. Our program will familiarize students with a wide range of approaches, methodologies, professional skills, and scholarly platforms applicable in social science, humanities, and creative research.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that UC Santa Cruz was one of only five universities nationwide selected to pilot a new SSRC Dissertation Proposal Development program is a sign of our innovative leadership in interdisciplinary scholarship and graduate research,&#8221; added Miller. &#8220;UCSC's program will give students across the divisions of social sciences, humanities, and the arts, the opportunity to engage fully with UC Santa Cruz's interdisciplinary environment and do pathbreaking doctoral research themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to UC Santa Cruz, the University Initiative is also partnering with Cornell University, Northwestern University, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Minnesota. It is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposed programs put forth by these universities demonstrate uncommonly innovative interdisciplinary approaches to dissertation research proposal development, and graduate education more broadly,&#8221; said Ira Katznelson, president of the SSRC.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8220;We believe these programs, once implemented by the universities, will inspire graduate students to create groundbreaking, compelling proposals that will effectively communicate the potential contributions their research can make within and beyond academe,&#8221; he added.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4d994e9f8072701752a34ca34a2966f5"><name>farm-docents</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Farm volunteer docent training starts March 9</title><summary>The seven-session docent training for volunteers at the UC Santa Cruz Farm begins on Thursday, March 9.</summary><keywords>farm, docents, training, volunteer</keywords><start-date>1487318400000</start-date><display-name>Farm-docents</display-name><path>/2017/02/farm-docents</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/farm-docents</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1487360575597</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487897890631</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The seven-session docent training for volunteers at the UC Santa Cruz Farm begins on Thursday, March 9.<br/>
 <br/>
 Docents lead tours for visitors to UCSC&#8217;s 33-acre organic farm. Perched on a campus hillside with sweeping views of Monterey Bay, the Farm hosts a wide variety of education, research, and community programs, and is open to the public daily. If you enjoy gardening, learning about food and farming issues, and sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge with others, this is a wonderful chance to join our dynamic team of volunteers. <br/>
 <br/>
 The 2017 Farm &amp; Garden docent-training program will take place on the UCSC Farm on seven Thursday afternoons from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., beginning March 9 and ending April 27 (no session on April 6). <br/>
 <br/>
 During the training sessions, participants will learn about organic farming and gardening practices, the history of the Alan Chadwick Garden and the UCSC Farm, and the research and education work of UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), which manages the Farm &amp; Garden programs and facilities. There is no pre-requisite to become a docent&#8212;just a willingness to learn and share.<br/>
 <br/>
 After completing the training, docents are asked to lead a minimum of six tours a year and are encouraged to help with public education events, plants sales, and other efforts that support the Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s community outreach work. Docents will also enjoy ongoing, free enrichment workshops on a variety of topics. <br/>
 <br/>
 Cost of the docent training is $25 ($5 for UCSC students) to cover materials. The initial session on March 9 is free and fees only apply to those who continue with the training. Campus parking costs will be covered during the training.<br/>
 <br/>
 Active docents receive a yearly membership to the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, which includes discounts at plant sales and local nurseries. Docents also receive free admission to many of the Friends&#8217; gardening and fruit tree care workshops.<br/>
 <br/>
 For more details and to arrange for parking during the training, please contact Melissa Betrone at (831) 459-3770, or mbetrone@ucsc.edu by Monday, March 6. The training is sponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz.

Sloan Foundation has awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship to Russ Corbett-Detig, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The prestigious two-year fellowship includes a grant of $60,000 to support Corbett-Detig's research, which focuses on evolutionary genetics and bioinformatics. Awarded annually since 1955, the <a href="https://sloan.org/fellowships/">Sloan Research Fellowships</a> are given to early-career scientists and scholars whose achievements and potential identify them as rising stars, the next generation of scientific leaders.</p>
<p>Corbett-Detig studies the processes that govern genetic diversity in populations of species ranging from fruit flies to humans. One focus of this work is on interactions between genes and the role of this phenomenon, called "epistasis," in evolution. Corbett-Detig has been studying epistasis in the context of isolated populations that come together and hybridize (a process called "admixture").</p>
<p>"Admixture is a way to evaluate how important interaction between genes is for the evolution of populations," he said. "Almost all human populations are admixed populations at some point in their evolutionary history, and this approach is a good way to study things like disease variation in human populations. We can't do genetic experiments with humans, but we can work with fruit flies in the laboratory to develop models of genetic processes."</p>
<p>Corbett-Detig's research combines classical experimental approaches in the laboratory with novel computational and statistical methods to analyze large genomic datasets. He has developed methods to estimate the times of multiple admixture events in the history of a population. Among other things, he plans to use this method to characterize the admixture histories of human populations for which demographic histories are not well known--for example, to determine if Greenlandic Inuits interbred with early Viking settlers.</p>
<p>Corbett-Detig earned his B.S. in evolution, ecology, and biodiversity at UC Davis and his Ph.D. in organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University. He joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz, where he is affiliated with the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a>, in 2016.</p>
<p>The Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded in close coordination with the scientific community. Candidates must be nominated by their fellow scientists, and winners are selected by an independent panel of senior scholars.

<p>Michael Berenbaum (project director of the <a href="https://www.ushmm.org"><strong><em>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</em></strong></a>) and Angel Nieves (consultant for the &#8220;Power of Place&#8221; exhibit at the new <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu"><strong><em>Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture</em></strong></a>) will examine the role of museums in today&#8217;s world of &#8220;alternative&#8221; facts, as they explore the potential for digital tools to reimagine how museums speak to their audiences.</p>
<p>The new National Museum of African American History &amp; Culture and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum both translate difficult, often traumatic, histories into museum exhibitions. They invite audiences of all ages and backgrounds to contend with diverse narratives of struggle, oppression, violence, and silence.</p>
<p>Through the use of digital content, these museums have recently begun to connect with audiences far beyond Washington, and to create new opportunities for understanding, commemoration, and reflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Museums like the National Museum of African American History and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum try and inform the public about parts of American and global history that contain difficult things for us to encounter--such as slavery and genocide,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of history Elaine Sullivan. &#8220;Dr. Nieves and Dr. Berenbaum have both been involved with curating content in these museums, and they are going to speak to us about some of the choices they made in representing these 'difficult histories' in the museum space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As our society goes digital, and museums are interacting with the public more and more online, both scholars also have to imagine how these difficult topics can be portrayed with respect,&#8221; Sullivan added. &#8220;How can museums both inform and serve the public in new ways online, but also make sure that past people are not dehumanized?&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Sullivan added that Nieves is an active 'digital humanist,' experimenting with new ways of researching and communicating his findings about race and the built environment using digital tools.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is currently working on a project that includes digital mapping and 3D modeling focused on the South African township of Soweto, that investigates and records how anti-apartheid actions took place within communities of resistance on the ground,&#8221; said Sullivan. &#160;</p>
<p>History professor Nathaniel Deutsch, director of the Center for Jewish Studies at UC Santa Cruz, noted that this event is part of an expanding campus emphasis on digital explorations in the study of Jewish history and culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the support of a three-year grant from the Koret Foundation and the recent addition to the university community of Rachel Deblinger, the director of the Digital Commons and a Ph.D. in modern Jewish history, the Jewish Studies program at UC Santa Cruz is well on the way to distinguishing itself as an international leader in the emerging field of digital Jewish Studies,&#8221; said Deutsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This important and timely collaborative event represents the latest in a series sponsored by our program&#8212;both on campus and off&#8212;that has redefined how we study Jewish history and culture, bringing them squarely into the digital age,&#8221;&#160;he added.</p>

<p>The film is based on an unfinished manuscript by Baldwin that was intended to be a radical novel about race in America, told through the lives and assassinations of three of his close friends: Martin Luther King Jr., Medgar Evers, and Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, the film is directed by Raoul Peck (<em>Sometimes in April, Lumumba</em>). The documentary has won 11 international awards to date, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker helped to organize the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brenda Griffin, President of the NAACP in Santa Cruz suggested to me that we do a panel following a showing of this film,&#8221; said Aptheker. &#8220;Together, and with assist from colleagues at Cabrillo College, and the generous auspices of the Del Mar Theater, we set up a panel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it could not be more timely given the resistance building across the United States and the globe to Donald Trump&#8217;s draconian and dangerous tweets, actions, and proposals.&#8221; Aptheker added.</p>
<p>"Our effort is for dialogue, using Baldwin&#8217;s prescience and brilliance to counter white supremacy in all its many guises.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The film screening begins at 7 p.m., followed by the panel discussion at 9 p.m. Admission to the film includes the panel (save your ticket stubs!)</p>
<p>The panel will include:</p>
<p><strong>Brenda J. Griffin, President, NAACP Santa Cruz</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Anthony, Professor of History, UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bettina Aptheker, Professor of Feminist Studies, UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ronaldo Wilson, Professor of Literature &amp; Creative Writing, UC Santa Cruz</strong></p>

<p>That changed on the afternoon of Aug. 9, 2002.</p>
<p>That day, she and her then-fianc&#233;, a 25-year-old Australian named Sean, were wrapped in a romantic embrace in the water off Ko Pha Ngan island in Thailand when she felt something brush against her thigh and then Sean drop her from his arms.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Sean was dead on the beach, the victim of one of the world&#8217;s most venomous creatures&#8212;a box jellyfish&#8212;and Fowler&#8217;s life was upside down.</p>
<p>What happened over the next months, including a miscarriage and a lonely trek through the war-torn countries of Eastern Europe as Fowler attempted to come to terms with loss and guilt, is the subject of a new memoir titled <em>Traveling with Ghosts,</em> which Booklist compared to Cheryl Strayed&#8217;s best-selling memoir, <em>Wild.</em></p>
<p>Tuesday, Feb. 21, at 7 p.m. Fowler will make an appearance at Bookshop Santa Cruz, to read from and discuss her book, including her eventual return to the ocean she loved.</p>
<p>Fowler, 42, lives in London now, the single mother of three children age 2 to 6. But in 2002 she was a world traveler who was living on Kangaroo Island off the coast of Australia, where, under the direction of Dan Costa, UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, she was doing research on the diving habits of Australian sea lion pups.</p>
<p>She and Sean had just gotten engaged and decided to celebrate with a trip to Thailand when he crossed paths with the jellyfish, a fast-swimming invertebrate with deadly tentacles that reach almost 10 feet in length and whose populations and territories are increasing around the world.</p>
<p>Fowler, who a few days after Sean&#8217;s death would miscarry their child, was wracked with grief and got on a plane for Eastern Europe, a place that was about as far away from home and the sunny beaches of Thailand as she could get.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was 28 when Sean died, and everyone was getting married and getting pregnant and buying houses, and everyone was in this amazing place in life and I had a dead fianc&#233; and a miscarriage,&#8221; Fowler recounted during a phone interview from her home in southwest London. &#8220;I found it hard to be surrounded by that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also found there was little room for grief in American or Australian culture. Acquaintances wouldn&#8217;t look her in the eye. Neighbors would cross the street to avoid talking to her. Worst of all were the people who spouted platitudes about it being Sean&#8217;s time or that good would come from tragedy.</p>
<p>Wandering alone through war-ravaged countries like Bosnia, Poland, and Israel, Fowler would not only discover the kindness of strangers but also an acceptance of death and of grief, a way to live with horrific events instead of turning away from them. She kept detailed journals from that time.</p>
<p>At the encouragement of friends and family&#8212;her mom is the writer Karen Joy Fowler&#8212;and after getting her Ph.D. in 2005 and working in Antarctica for scientific and adventure operations for several seasons, Fowler began writing.</p>
<p>The result is part travelogue and part love story, but it is also an examination of the intensity of loss and the way we grieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see a movie or a TV show or read a book where someone loses someone they love and two scenes later they are dating and are strong and have learned life lessons,&#8221; Fowler said. &#8220;Popular culture fast-forwards through what I wanted to focus on in my book &#8230; and that is the intense, day-after-day grief where you&#8217;re just trying to put one foot in front of the other. Not learning life lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now raising her children and working as a writer, Fowler has rediscovered her love of the ocean, although, she said, it is tinted with a darkness that wasn&#8217;t there before. She also said that, even though it has been 14 years since his death, she still thinks about Sean.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still miss him every day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I still wonder what we would have had together and, even if our relationship hadn&#8217;t survived, what he would be doing.</p>
&#8220;I think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I will always love him.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62b1173d8072701752a34ca3011bb9bd"><name>kahaani-dance-group-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A dedication to dance</title><summary>The hard-working members of UC Santa Cruz's Kahaani have been bringing their flashy moves, high standards and creativity to the competitive Bollywood dance circuit for the past three years. </summary><start-date>1487714400000</start-date><display-name>kahaani dance group feature story 2017</display-name><path>/2017/02/kahaani-dance-group-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/kahaani-dance-group-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1487714455965</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487982357150</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mary Elizabeth Garcia</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/kahaani-one-360.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/kahaani-one-360.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kahaani-one-360.jpg</name><display-name>kahaani-one-360.jpg</display-name><file-size>39209</file-size><width>360</width><height>223</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/kahaani-thumbnail-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/kahaani-thumbnail-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kahaani-thumbnail-80.jpg</name><display-name>kahaani-thumbnail-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>21295</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sumana Krishnakumar (College Nine &#8216;19, molecular, cell, and developmental biology) practices her dance routines until the performance becomes a matter of instinct.

</article-subhead><article-text><p dir="ltr">Around midnight on a weekday, you&#8217;d expect the Social Sciences building to be mostly empty&#8212;maybe a few students might be quietly studying, riffling pages, perhaps tapping out thoughts on a keyboard during a late-night brainstorm. And &#8230; dancing? &#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Yes&#8212;dancing. The members of the student dance troupe Kahaani have let nothing stand in their way of expressing themselves through dance&#8212;not even having to practice in unusual spaces at atypical times. Since its founding in 2014, the 19-member team has had to find creative solutions to the challenges that come with entering the competitive Bollywood dance circuit.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>During these after-hours practices, a small wireless speaker plays a mixture of pop, hip-hop, and Bollywood music, also known as &#8220;filmi&#8221; music, which is used in dance routines in Indian films. Bollywood musicals are renowned for their elaborate, high-energy dance routines with classical movements and nimble performers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Because they&#8217;re the first Bollywood dance team on campus, everything from constructing sets and designing costumes to finding a practice space has been a learning process, said Nagashree Setlur (Stevenson &#8216;17, global economics), one of Kahaani&#8217;s founders. &#8220;We&#8217;re basically the guinea pigs,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Before a competition, one can find Kahaani&#8217;s co-captains Setlur and Sumana Krishnakumar (College Nine &#8216;19, molecular, cell, and developmental biology) in a San Jose warehouse haggling for discounts on bolts of colorful fabric. Once they fix a price, the fabric goes to Krishnakumar&#8217;s mother, who sews the team&#8217;s costumes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hard work pays off</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The group&#8217;s focus and hard work has been paying off. This year, Kahaani has been accepted to Bollywood Berkeley, a prestigious competition that will allow the team to begin earning points within the Desi Dance Network, an organization that nurtures and encourages artists interested in competitive South Asian dance. Teams with the most points go on to Bollywood America, the championship for collegiate Bollywood dancers. This year&#8217;s competition will be held April 8 in</span> <span></span><span>Dallas, Texas.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At the Berkeley competition, Kahaani will perform an eight-minute dance routine in the Bollywood fusion style, a blend of Bollywood with American popular music influences. A short film precedes the dance, introducing the characters and the theme of the performance. The film segues into the live routine, which contains the setup, conflict, and resolution of the story.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The routine begins when the team runs on stage, jolting the audience with a blast of color and sound. The troupe aligns itself in sharp formations with equal space between each dancer. Energy stays high throughout the show as the dancers carry out full-body steps at whirlwind speeds, in perfect sync with the rest of the team. Brief interludes with dialogue advance the plot.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Our performance is essentially a very small Bollywood movie,&#8221; says Setlur.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As part of their application for the dance competition, contestants must submit a short, single-take audition tape showcasing the dancers and a sample of the team&#8217;s choreography. If the video passes muster, the troupe gets accepted to perform at the competition.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Born into Bollywood</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To raise funds for team expenses, Kahaani performs frequently around Santa Cruz, mostly for campus events. They have participated in college nights, including a Slug Pride celebration held at Cowell College, and at the UC Santa Cruz Quarry Amphitheater groundbreaking ceremony in November.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Aside from their many other tasks, the co-captains are the troupe&#8217;s choreographers, a skill that comes naturally for them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;When I listen to songs, I don&#8217;t listen to the music,&#8221; &#160;Krishnakumar said. &#8220;I automatically choreograph in my head.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The two co-captains say they owe their technical prowess to their upbringing. Watching Bollywood films at an early age and getting encouragement to pursue the dance style as a hobby has given them a lexicon of steps, a way to convey meaning through dance.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Growing up with an interest in Bollywood dance is something many of the team members share.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;As a child I started doing dances with my cousin,&#8221; said Anuja Patel (College Nine &#8216;19, philosophy and global economics). &#8220;We&#8217;d perform at birthdays and other family gatherings.&#8221; Patel has also had training in garba, a type of folk dance, and classical Indian dance.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Krishnakumar&#8217;s goal for the February competition is to have practiced the routine so much that the performance will become a matter of instinct. Once she is fully prepared, the steps will happen automatically as she hears the music. If she thinks about anything while she performs, she wants be aware of the fun she is having.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For the next month, the team will practice from 9 p.m. until midnight three to four times a week to prepare for Bollywood Berkeley. These practices are grueling, but worth it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Krishnakumar&#8217;s aggressive practice schedule, on top of her full course load in molecular, cell, and developmental biology requires dedication to the sport and upholding a commitment to her teammates.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing this to do our best,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And we&#8217;re doing it for the people on the team.&#8221;</span></p>

 <br/>
 The award is scheduled to be presented when the Special Language Research Special Interest Group holds its meeting in San Antonio in a couple of weeks.<br/>
 <br/>
 The award recognizes scholars who have developed research on second language pedagogy and instruction. The association reviewers were impressed by Bunch&#8217;s publication record, specifically his single-authored manuscripts in some of the most renowned journals in the world.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Dr. Bunch has an impressive record and a clear research program trajectory from K-12 English learners to community college learners. I think his work on community college ELL students, a population that is understudied, has made significant contribution to the field. His impact extends to not only teachers, students, and teacher educators, but also policy,&#8221; said a reviewer, in a letter to Bunch.<br/>
 <br/>
 The American Educational Research Association (AERA) was founded in 1916, and uses the research provided by scholars like Bunch to improve education for all.<br/>
 <br/>
 Bunch received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, his masters in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) from the University of Maryland, and his Ph.D. in education from Stanford.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="67788a908072701752a34ca309c42f56"><name>volleyball-ranking</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Men's volleyball ranks No. 2 in division</title><summary>Each week committees from around the country in each division study the week’s match ups to determine the best teams.</summary><keywords>ranking, ncaa, division III, athletics</keywords><start-date>1487782800000</start-date><display-name>Ranking</display-name><path>/2017/02/volleyball-ranking</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/volleyball-ranking</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1487794636022</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487795121136</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Sports</value><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/02/images/volleyball-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/02/images/volleyball-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>volleyball-400px.jpg</name><display-name>volleyball-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>178567</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz men&#8217;s volleyball team has earned a No. 2 ranking in NCAA Division III.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.avca.org/polls/diii-men/2-21-2017.html">ranking was published</a> Feb. 21 by the American Volleyball Coaches Association. Each week committees from around the country in each division study the week&#8217;s match ups to determine the best teams. Last week, the Slugs ranked No. 3. The next poll will be taken Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The Banana Slugs were awarded 227 points, second only to Springfield, which earned 254 points.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re practicing like it&#8217;s competitive playoffs with a roster of passionate and talented student-athletes. Passion is the prerequisite to winning,&#8221; said head coach Paul Leon, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2013 with a degree in marine biology. He was named head coach in 2016.</p>
<p>As a student, Leon served as team captain, sending the Slugs to a Continental Volleyball Conference championship and a national tournament bid in the spring of 2012.</p>

<br/>
 So far, the campus itself has survived the storms in fairly good shape, and I want to thank the crews that have worked around the clock, often in hazardous conditions, to maintain access, restore power, patch potholes and leaks, keep storm drains open and all of us safe.<br/>
<br/>
 It really doesn't matter where you live, just about everyone in Santa Cruz County and beyond has been affected by widespread road closures. Highway 17 has been highly problematic for many students, staff, and faculty, including hundreds of staff who recently moved into the new Scotts Valley Center. This has not been the rollout we had anticipated, so thank you for your patience.<br/>
<br/>
 I appreciate the flexibility of supervisors and managers who are making arrangements to minimize the inconvenience all of this has on employees, including encouraging those who can to work remotely when possible.<br/>

Called an "enormous Lyman-alpha nebula" (ELAN), it is the brightest and among the largest of these rare objects, only a handful of which have been observed.</p>
<p>ELANs are huge blobs of gas surrounding and extending between galaxies in the intergalactic medium. They are thought to be parts of the network of filaments connecting galaxies in a vast cosmic web. Previously discovered ELANs are likely illuminated by the intense radiation from quasars, but it's not clear what is causing the hydrogen gas in the newly discovered nebula to emit Lyman-alpha radiation (a characteristic wavelength of light absorbed and emitted by hydrogen atoms).</p>
<p>The newly discovered nebula was found at a distance of 10 billion light years in the middle of a region with an extraordinary concentration of galaxies. Researchers found this massive overdensity of early galaxies, called a "protocluster," through a novel survey project led by Zheng Cai, a Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Our survey was not trying to find nebulae. We're looking for the most overdense environments in the early universe, the big cities where there are lots of galaxies," said Cai. "We found this enormous nebula in the middle of the protocluster, near the peak density."</p>
<p><strong>MAMMOTH survey</strong></p>
<p>Cai is first author of a paper on the discovery accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04021">available online</a>. His survey project is called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06859">Mapping the Most Massive Overdensities Through Hydrogen</a> (MAMMOTH), and the newly discovered ELAN is known as MAMMOTH-1.</p>
<p>Coauthor J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said previously discovered ELANs have been detected in quasar surveys. In those cases, the intense radiation from a quasar illuminated hydrogen gas in the nebula, causing it to emit Lyman-alpha radiation. Prochaska's team discovered the first ELAN, dubbed the "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/12/physics-top-ten.html">Slug Nebula</a>," in 2014. MAMMOTH-1 is the first one not associated with a visible quasar, he said.</p>
<p>"It's extremely bright, and it's probably larger than the Slug Nebula, but there's nothing else visible except the faint smudge of a galaxy. So it's a terrifically energetic phenomenon without an obvious power source," Prochaska said.</p>
<p>Equally impressive is the enormous protocluster in which it resides, he said. Protoclusters are the precursors to galaxy clusters, which consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound together by gravity. Because protoclusters are spread out over a much larger area of the sky, they are much harder to find than galaxy clusters.</p>
<p>The protocluster hosting the MAMMOTH-1 nebula is massive, with an unusually high concentration of galaxies in an area about 50 million light years across. Because it is so far away (10 billion light years), astronomers are in effect looking back in time to see the protocluster as it was 10 billion years ago, or about 3 billion years after the big bang, during the peak epoch of galaxy formation. After evolving for 10 billion more years, this protocluster would today be a mature galaxy cluster perhaps only one million light years across, having collapsed down to a much smaller area, Prochaska said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Cosmic web</strong></p>
<p>The standard cosmological model of structure formation in the universe predicts that galaxies are embedded in a cosmic web of matter, most of which is invisible dark matter. The gas that collapses to form galaxies and stars traces the distribution of dark matter and extends beyond the galaxies along the filaments of the cosmic web. The MAMMOTH-1 nebula appears to have a filamentary structure that aligns with the galaxy distribution in the large-scale structure of the protocluster, supporting the idea that ELANs are illuminated segments of the cosmic web, Cai said.</p>
<p>"From the distribution of galaxies we can infer where the filaments of the cosmic web are, and the nebula is perfectly aligned with that structure," he said.</p>
<p>Cai and his coauthors considered several possible mechanisms that could be powering the Lyman-alpha emission from the nebula. The most likely explanations involve radiation or outflows from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is strongly obscured by dust so that only a faint source can be seen associated with the nebula. An AGN is powered by a supermassive black hole actively feeding on gas in the center of a galaxy, and it is usually an extremely bright source of light (quasars being the most luminous AGNs in visible light).</p>
<p>The intense radiation from an AGN can ionize the gas around it (called photoionization), and this may be one mechanism at work in MAMMOTH-1. When ionized hydrogen in the nebula recombines it would emit Lyman-alpha radiation. Another possible mechanism powering the Lyman-alpha emissions is shock heating by a powerful outflow of gas from the AGN.</p>
<p>The researchers described several lines of evidence supporting the existence of a hidden AGN energizing the nebula, including the dynamics of the gas and emissions from other elements besides hydrogen, notably helium and carbon.</p>
<p>"It has all the hallmarks of an AGN, but we don't see anything in our optical images. I expect there's a quasar that is so obscured by dust that most of its light is hidden," Prochaska said.</p>
<p>In addition to Cai and Prochaska at UC Santa Cruz, the team includes coauthors at Steward Observatory, University of Arizona; Korea Astronomy and Space Institute; Mount Stromlo Observatory, Australia; Pontifical Catholic University of Chile; Institute for Astronomy, ETH Zurich; California Institute of Technology; Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University; and National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

The campaign will close June 30.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are inviting everyone who cares about UC Santa Cruz to become a part of the campaign in the coming months,&#8220; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8221;Important work all across campus is benefiting from the philanthropy of our friends and alumni.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among opportunities to support the campaign: Giving Day on March 8. The 24-hour online event is raising funds for more than 100 projects, many of them student-led.</p>
<p>The campaign is the university&#8217;s first campuswide effort to build a culture of giving in support of students, faculty, and campus programs. Launched in 2009 and publicly announced in fall 2013, the campaign has raised&#160;$311 million in gifts.&#160;</p>
<p>Achievements to date include more than $30 million for scholarships and fellowships, a college endowment and naming, rebuilding the historic Hay Barn into a home for environmental programs, establishing more than a dozen endowed faculty chairs, and launch of restoration of the Quarry Amphitheater.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to see what additional progress we can make before we close the campaign,&#8221; said Keith Brant, vice chancellor for University Relations. &#8220;Initiatives in genomics, the renovation of the Science and Engineering Library and launching a new graduate program in coastal science and policy are among priority areas before the close. We hope everyone who has been considering a gift will seize the opportunity to become a part of this historic campaign and the future of our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giving Day on March 8 is designed to give donors the opportunity to connect on a very personal level with students, who are leading many of the featured projects. Last year, $340,000 was raised for 60 projects on Giving Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Increasingly, the campus is experiencing the very real benefit that comes from the generosity of those who feel connected to its mission and who care about its future,&#8221; said Brant. &#8220;There is no doubt that philanthropy will have a key role in our development going forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many A and B permit holders have been frustrated by inadequate parking spaces, especially in the Science Hill and Arts areas. Parking Enforcement staff have focused on those areas to see if non-permitted vehicles were a contributing factor. While they initially found some non-permitted vehicles, they report that the majority of vehicles in Core West and Performing Arts now have appropriate permits.</p>
<p>After reviewing options with the Advisory Committee on Campus Transportation and Parking (comprised of faculty, staff, and student representatives), TAPS has been approved to proceed with the following changes:</p>
<p>- All 28 pay stalls in Core West will be converted to A and B permit parking, effective March 1;<br/>
- A vehicle counter will be installed in Core West with a real-time display of parking availability by the end of April;<br/>
- Several minor modifications will be made in the Performing Arts lot to increase parking capacity during Spring Break.</p>
<p>The paystation in Core West will remain in operation for the purchase of flat rate permits after 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>This summer, we hope to start construction on a number of small infill parking projects around campus. Seven different projects are currently being designed and evaluated for potential implementation; we'll announce this summer's projects once they are chosen in early June.</p>
<p>Long-term parking improvements (as well as sustainable transportation programs, permit requirements, technology improvements, and service efficiencies) are also being discussed and planned for by the advisory committee.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, Director, Transportation and Parking Services </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="714f2e3e8072701752a34ca37b44bc94"><name>canvas-spring</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Canvas Live for Spring 2017</title><summary>ITS is pleased to announce that the new Learning Management System (LMS) Canvas at UCSC will launch for spring quarter.</summary><start-date>1487836800000</start-date><display-name>Canvas Live for Spring 2017</display-name><path>/2017/02/canvas-spring</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/canvas-spring</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1487959697622</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1487959697622</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>ITS is pleased to announce that the new Learning Management System (LMS) Canvas at UCSC will launch for spring quarter. Courses offered in the Canvas LMS prior to this have been part of a pilot in partnership with UCOP. Beginning with spring quarter, the Canvas service will be live.</p>
<p>Faculty have options to teach in Canvas right away or continue using eCommons, our legacy LMS, for a few more quarters. A course shell with enrollments will be created in Canvas for all courses in the Registrar's catalog, and any instructor who wishes to use Canvas for spring quarter will be able to do so. While we encourage faculty to adopt Canvas as soon as possible, eCommons will continue to be available through winter 2018 for undergraduate courses that already have materials in that system, allowing additional time to get existing course content migrated. New courses and graduate-level courses should be hosted in Canvas.</p>
<p>Canvas will be live and available to faculty to work in by early March. Additional information will be provided at that time on accessing the system, how to use the system, how course materials can be migrated, and how to get support 24x7. Students will receive additional information on accessing their courses and getting help with Canvas prior to the start of spring quarter.</p>
<p>We look forward to supporting the new opportunities for teaching and learning provided by Canvas. Please contact the FITC with any questions.

Mary died peacefully on February 18, surrounded by family and friends, after a long battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disorder that steals one's ability to move, but leaves the mind clear.</p>
<p>A UCSC alumna, Mary came to UC Santa Cruz for graduate school after earning a B.A. in biochemistry at UC San Diego. She earned her Ph.D. in biology in 1991, working with Manny Ares on RNA splicing. She carried out postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and then returned to UC Santa Cruz to work as a researcher with Clifton Poodry. She began teaching for the biology department in 1995 and continued for 21 years as a full-time lecturer, continuing her teaching with great courage and good humor even after the progression of ALS put her in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Mary taught some of UCSC's largest biology courses, including Female Physiology and Biology of AIDS, as well as many upper division lab courses. Her teaching was highly regarded by her students, many of whom sent heartfelt messages when they heard she was ill. It's clear she had a profound impact on the lives of her students, inspiring many to pursue careers in healthcare.</p>
<p>In addition to her teaching, Mary maintained an interest in research, publishing work on the diving physiology of marine mammals in collaboration with Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. Her research interests took her to all seven continents, including Antarctica, the Galapagos Islands, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>Mary also had a long run as a committed athlete, from studying martial arts in graduate school to competing in Ironman triathlons. She entered 15 Ironman-length triathlons, completing all but two. She also ran a number of marathons, including a 2011 half-marathon in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Mary is survived by her husband, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Daniel Costa, her father William Zavanelli, brother Tony, and sisters Terrie and Barbara. A memorial service is being planned.</p>
<p>Mary's family is forming an endowment to be named in her honor and will match gifts up to $25,000. Mary had requested that the fund be used to support undergraduate research in the health sciences. The Mary Zavanelli Fund will be among the projects accepting donations on <a href="http://givingday.ucsc.edu">UCSC Giving Day</a> on Wednesday, March 8.

Experts also believe currently available technologies can provide solutions to the problems of climate change. Implementing the transition to sustainable energy technologies won't be easy, however, and the need for action is urgent, according to the scientists and policymakers gathered at the fourth annual UC Santa Cruz Climate Conference, held on campus February 24-25.</p>
<p>"Acting now to secure a sustainable future" was the theme of the conference. The obstacles presented by the new administration in Washington, D.C., which is skeptical of climate science and opposed to policies aimed at mitigating climate change, cast a shadow over the conference and were the focus of the final panel, presented as the Fred Keeley Lecture on Environmental Policy.</p>
<p>Despite shifting U.S. policy, however, many speakers expressed optimism about the potential to continue making progress in efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"California is staying the course. It's not game over, it's game on," said Emily Wimberger, chief economist at the California Air Resources Board. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Existential threat</strong></p>
<p>In his keynote address, climate scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan made the case that climate change now poses an existential threat to our civilization. "Climate change can reach crisis levels in this century, affecting rich and poor alike," he said. "It is an urgent problem and requires urgent solutions."</p>
<p>Ramanathan, a professor of atmospheric and climate sciences at UC San Diego, predicted in 1980 that global warming would be detected by 2000. Looking at current projections, he said, the amount of global warming by 2100 could be catastrophic. Catastrophic for whom? "Everyone will feel the change," he said. "If half the planet is going to be displaced, that will affect us all."</p>
<p>The point of the conference, however, was not to dwell on the threats, but to bring together leading experts to discuss what can be done now to change the outcome, said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences. The conference was jointly sponsored by the divisions of Physical and Biological Sciences and Social Sciences.</p>
<p><strong>Energy efficiency</strong></p>
<p>The first panel, moderated by UCSC physics professor Sue Carter, focused on technological solutions. Energy efficiency has been called the "low-hanging fruit" for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, because it is relatively easy to implement. According to David Auston of the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara, however, "some of that fruit is still rotting on the vine."</p>
<p>The Department of Energy estimates that one-third of all the energy used in the United States is unnecessarily wasted. A major impediment for energy efficiency is that the cost is almost always all up front, so there is a tendency to defer implementation, even though it saves money in the long run, Auston said. For new buildings, he said, it's important to shift the focus from up-front costs to life-cycle costs, and he has been working on recommendations for UC to take that approach for new construction.</p>
<p>"It is important for UC to set a model for the rest of the world," Auston said. "We have an obligation to be a living laboratory and share what we learn with others."</p>
<p>In a panel on motivating change, venture capitalist Derek Proudian noted that the savings available from energy efficiency is already driving adoption of new technologies. He served as CEO of Daintree Networks, a company recently acquired by General Electric that retrofits buildings with smart technology for energy efficiency.</p>
<p>"Preaching about climate change won't affect behavior as much as a good return on investment, and there is money to be made in using information technology to improve efficiency," Proudian said. "That trajectory is going to continue, so that's one reason to have optimism."</p>
<p>The transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources will be more difficult. But several panelists maintained that currently available renewable energy technologies are sufficient to meet our energy needs.</p>
<p>"It is technically and economically possible to power the country with 100 percent clean, renewable energy sources," said Mark Jacobson, who directs the Atmosphere/Energy Program at Stanford University.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Solar power</strong></p>
<p>Daniel Shugar, CEO of solar energy company NEXTracker, overflowed with enthusiasm as he described the rapid growth of solar energy and the potential for solar technologies to provide increasing amounts of clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>Yet fossil fuels still account for 63 percent of U.S. power production, and the proportion is higher worldwide, noted power industry consultant Peter Cartwright. "There are real challenges as the industry tries to provide more power for more people and at the same time reduce greenhouse gas emissions," he said.</p>
<p>Switching from coal to natural gas can help, because the greenhouse gas emissions are about 50 percent less from natural gas. But converting coal-fired power plants to natural gas requires a big investment, and the plant then continues burning fossil fuels for decades into the future. Cartwright quipped that natural gas has been called "the methadone of fossil fuels" &#8212; less dangerous but just as addictive as coal.</p>
<p>A panel moderated by Rob Irion, director emeritus of the UCSC Science Communication Program, focused on the communications challenges posed by the prevalence of climate change denial in the United States. Laura Helmuth, science editor for the <em>Washington Post</em>, outlined the factors that make it hard to explain climate change to the public: climate change is complicated, it's invisible, it's a long-term process, and there is a well-organized campaign to spread disinformation about it.</p>
<p>Susan Hassol, a climate communication specialist, said overcoming the partisan gap on climate change requires focusing on shared values. "People are motivated by other reasons, such as jobs and clean air. There are real economic and health benefits of making the transition to clean energy," she said.</p>
<p>Edward Maibach, who directs the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, emphasized the importance of simple, clear messages, repeated often. "The human mind doesn't deal well with complexity," he said. "The less we say, the more we're heard."</p>
<p>In response to a question about scientists planning a "march for science" in Washington, D.C., the panelists expressed unanimous support for the idea. "Public demonstrations do have an effect on politicians," Maibach said.</p>
<p>Ramanathan, meanwhile, is working with other UC scientists, including Carter and environmental studies professor Daniel Press at UCSC, to develop a climate solutions course for undergraduates to be offered in fall 2017 at all ten campuses. "We want to create a million climate warriors," he said. "Let us bend the curve on climate change before it's too late."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b7126bf8072701752a34ca3997d99f5"><name>transgender-community</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>We stand with the transgender community</title><summary>In the wake of President Trump's repeal this week of federal protections for transgender students in public schools, we are proud to state that our campus commitment to transgender members of our community is absolutely unchanged.</summary><start-date>1487923200000</start-date><display-name>We stand with the transgender community</display-name><path>/2017/02/transgender-community</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/02/transgender-community</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1488398131530</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1488398131530</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In the wake of President Trump's repeal this week of federal protections for transgender students in public schools, we are proud to state that our campus commitment to transgender members of our community is absolutely unchanged.</p>
