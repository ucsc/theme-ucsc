<p>The struggle to transform the food system&#8212;to make food production more ecologically sound, to protect the health and well-being of farmworkers, to increase the access and affordability of fresh food&#8212;is becoming more oppositional and more collective, said Guthman, co-editor with Alison Hope Alkon of the new book, <em>The New Food Activism: Opposition, Cooperation, and Collective Action</em> (Oakland, CA: University of California Press, 2017).</p>
<p>"There are limits to shopping your way to social change. Strategies focused on individual buying decisions, like buying organic and fair-trade food, are inherently limited because they are based on their appeal to consumers who are able and willing to pay more," said Guthman, a professor of social sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "They don't undermine existing structures."</p>
<p>The weakness of the "pocketbook" approach is evident in acreage figures: Organic acreage still accounts for less than 1 percent of farmland in the United States, and only 5 percent of sales, according to Guthman. "Something about market-based approaches is not working when the best we can accomplish is ensuring that a small number of consumers get beautiful, healthy, fresh food while everybody else gets the dregs," she observed. "Activism should be based in the concerns of those most hurt by existing policies and practices."</p>
<p>Food movement leaders are embracing new avenues as they press for more sweeping change, including greater regulation of pesticides, immigration reform, and changes to federal farm subsidies.<br/><br/>In <em>The New Food Activism</em>, contributors critique mainstream food movements and shine a light on examples of food activism that pushed the boundaries and emerged triumphant. Chapters cover the work of pesticide-drift activists in California; the battle in Canada against genetically modified wheat; the demise of methyl iodide in California; and several chapters focus on struggles to bring greater justice to food workers, including campaigns for "good jobs, good wages, and good food." Throughout the book, the emphasis is on building movements that are multiracial, multiclass, and geographically diverse.<br/><br/>"The labor and food-justice movements were on different tracks, but now they are aligning," said Guthman, adding that new coalitions have formed at a critical historical moment.<br/><br/>"The Trump administration's agenda has alerted the public at large that policy matters, and that overhauling the food system is about more than creating utopian gardens," said Guthman. "We are finally seeing more pushback because people want real change. They want economic, environmental, and social justice and they are beginning to understand that collective public action works." <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a8ff0772807270176705df1ac97d12e8"><name>farm-garden-anniversary</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz celebrates 50 years of organic farming</title><summary>The three-day celebration culminated with a joyful dinner presided over by famed chef, restaurateur, and organic food advocate Alice Waters.</summary><start-date>1501743600000</start-date><display-name>Agroecology</display-name><path>/2017/08/farm-garden-anniversary</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/farm-garden-anniversary</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1501778870901</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1502310278106</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Matthew Renda</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rF4GbmOBDZc" width="560"></iframe></embed><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/chadwick-gathering.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/chadwick-gathering.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chadwick-gathering.jpg</name><display-name>chadwick-gathering.jpg</display-name><file-size>201666</file-size><width>400</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Alan Chadwick Garden</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/farm-fruit-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/farm-fruit-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-fruit-80.jpg</name><display-name>farm-fruit-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16450</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Fruit tree</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Amah Mutsun tribal chair Valentin Lopez addressed 50th anniversary participants in the Alan Chadwick Garden at the <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_673267499" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">Saturday</span></span> morning &#8220;Fog Lift.&#8221;&#160;(Photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/waters-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/waters-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>waters-400.jpg</name><display-name>waters-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>123579</file-size><width>400</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Alice Waters</image-alt><image-caption>Famed chef and organic food advocate&#160;Alice Waters spoke during a Saturday evening banquet outside the Hay Barn.

(Photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A half century of pioneering work in organic farming was evident this past weekend as hundreds of farmers, educators, scientists, and alumni gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Alan Chadwick Garden&#8212;and all that has followed.</p>
<p>The three-day celebration culminated with a joyful dinner presided over by famed chef, restaurateur, and organic food advocate Alice Waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you know how many businesses like mine buy food from people who are taking care of the land who were educated here at Santa Cruz,&#8221; Waters told a crowd of 500 people gathered at long tables outside the historic Hay Barn as they dined on organic fare. &#8220;This all comes from Alan Chadwick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder of the garden that today bears his name, Chadwick was a master gardener who introduced organic farming and gardening techniques to the campus and sparked a movement that would spread those principles far and wide&#8212;decades before anyone coined the phrase "sustainable agriculture."</p>
<p>Jim Nelson of Camp Joy Gardens in the San Lorenzo Valley said Chadwick influenced his decision to become an organic farmer and prompted him to turn his farm into a classroom. Nelson met Chadwick in 1967, just as the back-to-the-land movement was brewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night, we were all talking about various aspects of Alan&#8217;s personality, which was big,&#8221; Nelson said, laughing. &#8220;The thing that really sticks out was his generosity.&#8221; Chadwick had the patience and generosity that are staples of all great educators, said Nelson.</p>
<p>The weekend featured a full slate of events, including tours of the Farm &amp; Garden, community workshops, a symposium featuring graduates of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, and reunions for Nelson and others who studied under Chadwick and his successors.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of what is now the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), the apprenticeship is a rigorous six-month residential program that immerses participants in hands-on farming and gardening techniques, as well as the scientific underpinnings of sustainable farming. Over the years, the focus has broadened to include social justice issues, such as fair wages and safe working conditions for those involved in food production.</p>

<p>The 30-acre Farm produces about $165,000 worth of organic produce annually. Apprentices and undergraduate interns tend rows of kale, lettuce, tomatoes, and other row crops, as well as orchards full of apples, pears, plums, apricots, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important crop we produce every year is the people who come through here,&#8221; said Christof Bernau, a former apprentice and current Farm Garden Manager.&#160;</p>
<p>As the organic movement and the principles of biodynamic farming have moved into the mainstream, more universities have established working farms.</p>
<p>"You know you&#8217;re good when people start copying what you do," UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal told the dinner crowd.</p>
<p>"What&#8217;s taken root is amazing," he said. "1,500 apprentices: Think about how many lives have been touched by this facility. We were first&#8212;and 50 years later we are the global leader in the sustainable food movement."</p>
<p>Today, the Farm &amp; Garden also serve as outdoor laboratories for faculty and staff researchers focused on soil science, plant varietals, pollinators, innovative farming techniques, organic pest control, and other aspects of agroecology.</p>
<p>Darryl Wong, farm site and research lands manager for CASFS, touched on some of the research being conducted: a no-till trial on the Farm aimed at increasing carbon sequestration; the use of hedgerows to manage pests; and strategies to help organic strawberry growers and nurseries on the Central Coast.</p>
<p>CASFS is also spearheading efforts to provide fresh, local, organic produce to UC Santa Cruz students through the Food Systems Working Group (FSWG).</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of my friends live off noodles, and I know one student who started a GoFundMe (campaign) so he could buy food,&#8221; said Carlos Lemos, a fourth-year student and co-chair of FSWG.</p>
<p>Tim Galarneau, the community-engaged education coordinator for CASFS, encourages undergraduates to take a lead role in distributing organic produce to students who may be experiencing food insecurity. Lemos and others stock the campus food pantry full of fresh, Farm- and Garden-grown produce, host pop-up produce stands on campus, and advocate for more healthy, locally grown food in the dining halls.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think we are just managing the Farm, but we are very intersectional with issues of equity and justice,&#8221; said Galarneau.</p>
<p>Many of the former apprentices who returned for the 50th anniversary welcomed the broader focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The social-justice aspect of this program wasn&#8217;t really here when I attended,&#8221; said Kristina Scott, a 2003 apprentice with CASFS. &#8220;It&#8217;s really good to see that conversation got started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal echoed that theme during his remarks at dinner: &#8220;It&#8217;s really an absolute pleasure to be a part of the 50 year celebration of this place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It represents so much of what UC Santa Cruz is about&#8212;environmental stewardship, sustainability, and social justice.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

history and Jewish Studies Alma Rachel Heckman has been appointed as the new holder of the Neufeld-Levin Holocaust Endowed Chair at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary endowed chair was established in 1995 by Anne Neufeld-Levin, a former president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees, to support teaching, research, and public service related to the Holocaust, including its circumstances and continuing implications.</p>
<p>In establishing the chair, Neufeld-Levin noted:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I feel compelled to help keep alive my legacy from the Holocaust surrounding World War II. My parents and I were on a train March 13, 1939, emigrating from Vienna, Austria, to the United States at the exact same moment Hitler&#8217;s troops invaded Czechoslovakia. A miracle separated my escaping alive from the eventual annihilation of my grandparents, aunts, and six million other Jews. As a result, I believe it is critical to perpetually study the circumstances culminating in Hitler&#8217;s final solution for Jews. Only by remembering can we immortalize the millions of victims and help prevent a similar onslaught against any group.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>At that time, Neufeld Levin also donated a body of Holocaust-related artifacts to establish The Neufeld Family Archive, which is housed in Special Collections of the University Library. The archive includes wartime identity papers and passports, medals, stamps, photos, and letters which were carefully preserved--first by her parents and then by Levin.</p>
<p><strong>A </strong><strong>specialist in the modern Jewish history</strong> of North Africa and the Middle East with an interest in transnationalism and empire, Heckman said she was very excited and grateful for the opportunity to serve as the new chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the help of the Neufeld-Levin Chair, I plan to continue the strong Holocaust studies curriculum on campus, an annual lecture series, as well as public history and digital history projects that work toward democratizing an increasingly sophisticated understanding of Holocaust history and its global implications,&#8221; said Heckman.</p>
<p>As a scholar of the Holocaust&#8217;s effects on the Middle East and North Africa, Heckman added that she hopes to use the chair to provide educational and programmatic opportunities not commonly available in Holocaust history curricula.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nuanced, sophisticated understanding of the Holocaust is critical,&#8221; Heckman explained. &#8220;Most are aware of the Holocaust in its &#8216;heartlands,&#8217; or indeed &#8216;bloodlands,&#8217; as one eminent scholar has put it. But until recently, historians neglected the labor camps and anti-Semitic policies of Vichy North Africa, compounded by a neglect of the broader region of the Middle East and North Africa as a point of safe harbor and transit for European Jewish refugees of World War II.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am planning to invite prominent scholars to speak on campus whose work touches on that region over the five-year period," she added. &#8220;I will also organize a film festival that addresses representation of World War II in the region, inviting the directors of a number of these films, as well as academics for a conference related to the film festival.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Heckman noted that she also has a number of ongoing projects with members of the Santa Cruz community who either were themselves European Jewish refugees in North Africa during the war, or recorded interviews with them. These projects involve digitizing, transcribing, and eventually publishing interviews, photographs, and stories so that this information becomes available both to the local and scholarly communities.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering the college from the parking lot, you&#8217;ll be greeted by an abstract rust-colored sculpture, as tall as a person and much wider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further along, a bell roughly the size and shape of a loaf of sourdough sits suspended in the shade of some bushes. A 32-foot intricately carved redwood totem pole stands among some trees in the quad. These sculptures speak volumes about Porter&#8217;s ethos. Instead of being tucked away in an art gallery, they&#8217;re a part of everyday life in the college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Porter, we use art as a way of expressing ourselves,&#8221; explains Porter student Andrea Diaz (Porter &#8216;18, film and digital media).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter students major in every discipline at the University, but as a group, they have a special attachment to the arts and the college, originally known as College Five, has had a fine arts focus since its inception in 1969. In its first year as a college, Barbara Sesnon Cartan, a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Area philanthropist, gave UC Santa Cruz a gift to establish an art gallery for College Five. The naming gift honored Cartan&#8217;s mother, Mary Porter Sesnon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after, Barbara Cartan and her siblings gave 66.7 acres of land in Soquel to the university. In 1981, proceeds from the land sale created an endowment large enough to rename the college in honor of the siblings&#8217; grandfather, Benjamin F. Porter, an early resident of Santa Cruz County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Porter College core course, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Composition, Creative Inquiry, and the Arts,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores the relationship between critical thinking and the creative process. It approaches the arts not only as objects of study, but also as instances of research, design, composition, and revision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The core course is the foundation for a student&#8217;s undergraduate experience,&#8221; said Sean Keilen, Porter&#8217;s provost. The course &#8220;provides deep immersion into academic life and culture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiny writing groups supplement the larger core class meetings to ensure each student&#8217;s writing process involves plenty of feedback from their peers and instructor. Students experience the artistic process firsthand through art workshops at the Mary Porter Sesnon gallery. There is a chance to exhibit artwork at EnCore, an art show at the end of the quarter.</span></p>
<p><strong>A college of opportunities</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost Keilen, who is also an associate professor of literature, urges students to take advantage of funding opportunities for student-led projects, including travel grants for undergraduates who want to take their creativity on the road. Camellia Boutros (Porter &#8216;16, computer science and music) used the Nathan Foley-Mendelssohn Travel Scholarship in Porter to travel to the West Bank, where she taught music to Palestinian children for a summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter funds local projects, too. Makenna Pearlman Bantillo (Porter &#8216;18, psychology) received a Porter College Undergraduate Fellowship to fund a dance performance she will direct at the Barn Theater near the base of campus next fall. The fellowship will fund dancer trainings, equipment, and improvements to the stage. Bantillo encourages her fellow students to pursue these opportunities. &#8220;You expect the proposal to be a lot more difficult than it is,&#8221; Bantillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really simple to apply for these things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students who need a creative outlet are welcome to join Porter&#8217;s MakerSpace Co-op, a den with art supplies and equipment. This space is full of large tables for working. There are tall shelves with paint and other supplies. Larger tools like a sewing machine and a 3D printer are available. Students share tips and techniques with one another and work joyfully on their crafts.</span></p>
<p><strong>An inspirational setting for student artists</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The physical aspects of Porter are as conducive to creativity as the college&#8217;s programs. Students find inspiration just by sitting on the sculpture informally known as the Porter Squiggle, a large red metal artwork whose shape is open to interpretation. To some passersby, the sculpture by Kenny Farrell (Porter &#8216;74, art), dating to 1974, resembles a wave. To others, it looks like a doctor&#8217;s signature at the bottom of a prescription order. Even the actual name of this piece&#8212;&#8220;Untitled&#8221;&#8212;gives plenty of room for a student&#8217;s wandering imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To quietly reflect on their creative ideas, students head to the famous Porter koi pond. Massive fish, some of them almost as old as Porter college itself, swim about in the triangular stone pool. The fountain in the center of the pond provides ambient sounds of trickling water, just loud enough to drown out the rest of campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two main residential buildings, Porter A and Porter B, surround a small grassy area known as the Porter quad. The semi-enclosed space encourages the social life of Porter students, who run into each other in this congregated space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To me the layout of the residential buildings is like a blank canvas,&#8221; notes student Christian Bernal (Porter &#8216;18, music).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernal explains how the features of the college foster creativity. The building&#8217;s concrete sides host student murals that change every year. There is a stage for performances and a large grassy area for students who want to draw and paint on the lawn. Sound reverberates between the two concrete buildings, creating natural amplification. It&#8217;s common to see students practicing ukulele, guitar, or accordion on the benches.</span></p>
<p><strong>Famous alumni </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The college is a hotbed for creativity, so it&#8217;s no wonder Porter has been home to some of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s stellar artists and performers, many of whom have gone on to successful careers in the arts. Maya Rudolph (Porter &#8216;95, art) is famous for her work on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday Night Live, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after which she went on to roles in film and television. Kenneth Corday (Porter &#8216;75, aesthetic studies) is the executive producer of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days of Our Lives,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was recently recognized with a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter alumni seem to have an affinity for the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. Kalen Egan (Porter &#8216;05, film) produced Amazon&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Man in the High Castle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series, based on Dick&#8217;s novel. Tod Machover, a Porter music student in the 1970s, composed an opera based on Dick&#8217;s novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter students don&#8217;t need to leave the college for a brush with fame. One afternoon in the early 1980s, jazz legend Dave Brubeck came to Porter College after he received an invitation from Monte Brill (Porter &#8216;83, art), who had made a sculpture honoring &#8220;Take Five&#8221;, a composition made famous by the Brubeck Quartet. That afternoon, Brubeck and Brill took turns sitting on the chair-like structures of the sculpture and sipped champagne with other students. The sculpture remains in the college today. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be7f51c8807270176705df1a53cac9cf"><name>federal-funding-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Federal support essential for cutting-edge research</title><summary>By Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor for Research—The University of California is at a crossroads in its push to remain the leading educational system in world-class research.

Across our campuses, institutes, and partnerships, discussions are taking place regarding the drastic reductions to federal research funding being considered in Washington, D.C., that threaten to disrupt our capacity to produce invaluable research. <br/><br/>In fiscal year 2015-16, UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/osp/reports/ar2016.pdf">received $128 million</a> to support our research, of which $106 million originated from federal agencies. These research funds helped support our world-renowned UC Observatories, Genome Institute, our newly opened Silicon Valley campus and outstanding research across the UCSC campus. <br/><br/>Federal research funding also supports our graduate students, who push the boundaries of their respective disciplines, provide mentorship to our undergraduates, and engage our Santa Cruz community at large while preparing to bring new ideas and innovations to the world. It is hard to imagine both the immediate and long-term consequences of drastic changes to federal research support.<br/><br/>We now are focusing our attention on the FY 2018 budget Congress must pass. The White House Budget Request proposes to cut $54 billion from federal programs important to UC, such as student financial aid and medical, energy and environmental research.<br/><br/>Overall, UC receives approximately $1.6 billion in federal student financial aid programs including grants and scholarships, graduate fellowships, loans, and work-study. <br/><br/>The federal government is also the University of California&#8217;s single most important source of research funding, accounting for nearly $2.9 billion in research awards annually. The groundbreaking discoveries and inventions by UC scientists and labs improve lives and fuel economic growth in California, across the country, and throughout the world. These cuts would be devastating to California and the nation, and would stifle UC&#8217;s ability to educate students at all levels and address our country&#8217;s most pressing needs and challenges.<br/><br/>Recently, the UC Office of the President launched the University of California Action Network (UCAN), a community for advocates who share UC&#8217;s commitment to education, public service, and research. Providing real-time updates, newsletters, and greater information about how to get involved, UCAN is at the forefront of our efforts to shape better outcomes for federal research funding. <br/><br/>I urge you to <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/support-uc/ucan/join">sign up for UCAN</a> as we embark on the journey ahead. Together, we can help support UCSC&#8217;s efforts and ensure that our school remains an international leader in cutting-edge research.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bea77187807270176705df1a941d02d4"><name>tau-ceti-planets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Four Earth-sized planets detected orbiting the nearest sun-like star</title><summary>Four Earth-sized planets orbit the nearest sun-like star, tau Ceti, which is about 12 light years away and visible to the naked eye, astronomers say.</summary><keywords>exoplanets, extrasolar planets, Steven Vogt</keywords><start-date>1502200800000</start-date><display-name>Four Earth-sized planets detected orbiting the nearest sun-like star</display-name><path>/2017/08/tau-ceti-planets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/tau-ceti-planets</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1502142229660</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1502377921126</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/tau-ceti-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/tau-ceti-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tau-ceti-410.jpg</name><display-name>tau-ceti-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>99333</file-size><width>410</width><height>410</height></image><image-alt>planets of tau ceti versus our solar system</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/tau-ceti-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/tau-ceti-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tau-ceti-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tau-ceti-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15088</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>planets of tau ceti</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>This illustration compares the four planets detected around the nearby star tau Ceti (top) and the inner planets of our solar system (bottom). (Illustration courtesy of Fabo Feng)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new study by an international team of astronomers reveals that four Earth-sized planets orbit the nearest sun-like star, tau Ceti, which is about 12 light years away and visible to the naked eye. These planets have masses as low as 1.7 Earth mass, making them among the smallest planets ever detected around nearby sun-like stars. Two of them are super-Earths located in the habitable zone of the star, meaning they could support liquid surface water.</p>
<p>The planets were detected by observing the wobbles in the movement of tau Ceti. This required techniques sensitive enough to detect variations in the movement of the star as small as 30 centimeters per second.</p>
<p>"We are now finally crossing a threshold where, through very sophisticated modeling of large combined data sets from multiple independent observers, we can disentangle the noise due to stellar surface activity from the very tiny signals generated by the gravitational tugs from Earth-sized orbiting planets," said coauthor Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>According to lead author Fabo Feng of the University of Hertfordshire, UK, the researchers are getting tantalizingly close to the 10-centimeter-per-second limit required for detecting Earth analogs. "Our detection of such weak wobbles is a milestone in the search for Earth analogs and the understanding of the Earth's habitability through comparison with these analogs," Feng said. "We have introduced new methods to remove the noise in the data in order to reveal the weak planetary signals."</p>
<p>The outer two planets around tau Ceti are likely to be candidate habitable worlds, although a massive debris disc around the star probably reduces their habitability due to intensive bombardment by asteroids and comets.</p>
<p>The same team also investigated tau Ceti four years ago in 2013, when coauthor Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire led an effort in developing data analysis techniques and using the star as a benchmark case. "We came up with an ingenious way of telling the difference between signals caused by planets and those caused by star's activity. We realized that we could see how star's activity differed at different wavelengths and use that information to separate this activity from signals of planets," Tuomi said.</p>
<p>The researchers painstakingly improved the sensitivity of their techniques and were able to rule out two of the signals the team had identified in 2013 as planets. "But no matter how we look at the star, there seem to be at least four rocky planets orbiting it," Tuomi said. "We are slowly learning to tell the difference between wobbles caused by planets and those caused by stellar active surface. This enabled us to essentially verify the existence of the two outer, potentially habitable planets in the system."</p>
<p>Sun-like stars are thought to be the best targets in the search for habitable Earth-like planets due to their similarity to the sun. Unlike more common smaller stars, such as the red dwarf stars Proxima Centauri and Trappist-1, they are not so faint that planets would be tidally locked, showing the same side to the star at all times. Tau Ceti is very similar to the sun in its size and brightness, and both stars host multi-planet systems.</p>
<p>The data were obtained by using the HARPS spectrograph (European Southern Observatory, Chile) and Keck-HIRES (W. M. Keck Observatory, Mauna Kea, Hawaii).</p>
<p>A paper on the new findings was accepted for publication in the <em>Astronomical Journal</em> and is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02051">available online</a>. In addition to Vogt, Feng, and Tuomi, coauthors include Hugh Jones of the University of Hertfordshire, UK; John Barnes of the Open University, UK; Guillem Anglada-Escude of Queen Mary University of London; and Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institute of Washington.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p>The Dickens Universe combines elements of a research symposium, arts festival, book club, and summer camp all rolled into one big, unforgettable week of intellectual celebration.</p>
<p>It brings together a wide array of participants including international scholars, college faculty, high school teachers, students, and members of the general public for a week of study and socializing at the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>The Dickens Universe is the signature event of <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/"><strong>The Dickens Project</strong></a>, a scholarly consortium headquartered at UC Santa Cruz that consists of members from different universities across the United States and around the globe.&#160;It is internationally recognized as the premier center for Dickens studies in the world and is one of the leading sites for research on 19th-century British culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Project continues to grow in membership--now 47 colleges and universities that range from Israel to Australia and include ones in Canada and the U.K., said John Jordan, director and co-founder of the Dickens Project. "Attendance remains strong and this year we had a larger number of faculty than ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>New member institutions that recently joined include the University of Haifa (Israel), the University of Georgia, the University of Pennsylvania, and Southern Methodist University. Faculty and graduate students from these schools were in attendance this year at the Dickens Universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;What attracts people is the high quality of the program--lectures by world class scholars along with many opportunities for small group discussion,&#8221; Jordan noted. &#8220;And issues raised by Victorian novels remain pertinent today, such as social reform, class, gender, marriage, personal relationships, and personal ethics.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Dickens Universe always offers</strong> a week of total immersion in the world of Victorian fiction, usually focused on a novel by Charles Dickens. But this year marked the first time a work by Dickens was not featured. Instead, the spotlight was on <em>Middlemarch</em> by George Eliot.</p>
<p>A pen name, George Eliot was actually Mary Anne Evans, who wrote under a male name so that bias against her gender would not diminish her standing as an author or influence the reception of her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;swerve&#8217; from Dickens to George Eliot proved very successful,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;Participants were unanimous in their appreciation of <em>Middlemarch</em> as one of the great 19th-century novels. Comparisons between Dickens and Eliot continued throughout the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The choice of Middlemarch has attracted new participants,&#8221; he added. "A few people who are dedicated Dickens loyalists may have stayed away, but they will be pleased to know that we will return to Dickens in 2018 when the featured novel will be <em>Little Dorrit</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>A special event in connection with <em>Middlemarch</em> this year was a staged reading of a play, "A Most Dangerous Woman" by playwright Cathy Templesman, based on the life of author George Eliot and performed by members of the Santa Cruz Shakespeare company.</p>
<p>Another highlight was a presentation by students and teachers from the NAI (Neighborhood Academic Initiative) in Los Angeles, describing their remarkable experience of teaching and studying <em>Middlemarch</em> in a South LA high school.</p>
<p>&#8220;This week of focusing on George Eliot in relation to Charles Dickens&#8217;s life advanced our understanding of the importance of the Victorian world in shaping modern society and the modern imagination--and especially the role of women in contemporary life,&#8221; noted UCSC emeritus English and comparative literature professor Murray Baumgarten, a co-founder of the Dickens Project. &#8220;And all of this emerged in the company of major scholars, old friends, and new ones who we hope will continue to work with us in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jordan noted that The Dickens Project additionally has just been awarded a $124,000 grant from the <strong><em>National Endowment for the Humanities</em></strong> to host a four-week seminar for school teachers on campus next summer as part of its ongoing outreach program.</p>
<p>The title of the seminar will be &#8220;Why Literature Matters: Voices from Nineteenth-Century American and British Literature.&#8221;</p>

different perspective with eclectic, meaningful subject matter</article-subhead><article-text><p>Tal Skloot followed Bob Coomber as he made his way up the steep trail from Onion Valley in the eastern Sierra toward the 11,700-foot Kearsarge Pass. <br/><br/>The path was narrow and twisting, dotted with stretches of rough scree and high rock steps designed to slow erosion. Still, most people could do the strenuous hike in half a day. <br/><br/>But Coomber was not most people, and Skloot, a film director and editor with 30 titles to his credit, wanted to chronicle the singular determination and strength required by this man as he spent day after day on the climb and gained 2,600 feet of elevation. <br/><br/>The result is a documentary film titled <em>4 Wheel Bob</em>, which tells the story of Coomber&#8217;s passion for nature and for hiking despite the fact that juvenile diabetes caused his bones to become so brittle his leg once spontaneously shattered, which meant he was traveling the Kearsarge Pass trail in a wheelchair. <br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested in stories that haven&#8217;t been told and that show a different perspective,&#8221; says Skloot (Stevenson &#8217;88, classical music performance), who spent seven years on the Coomber project. &#8220;I think it (film) is a great way for people to learn about the world. &#8220;<br/><br/>Skloot&#8217;s filmmaking chops should be no surprise considering his father, Steven Skloot, was second-unit director for <em>The Godfather</em> and production manager for movies like <em>Love Story</em> and <em>Live and Let Die</em>.<br/><br/>Skloot, now 50, remembers being on the New Orleans set for the 1973 <em>Live and Let Die</em> and watching the filming of a chase scene in which a motorboat flies over a wedding reception. <br/><br/>&#8220;I thought it was amazing,&#8221; Skloot says of the shoot, &#8220;this whole setup for a piece of imagined reality. As a kid of 8, my mouth just fell open.&#8221;<br/><br/>Still, Skloot, who now lives in El Sobrante, did not intend to be a filmmaker. At UC Santa Cruz, he played classical guitar and studied music&#8212;although he often took out his Super 8 camera to make small movies, including a memorable film of an encounter between a slow-moving banana slug and an energetic spider. But after a few years of working as a gardener and woodworker to supplement his music and teaching gigs after graduation, he switched direction and attended the American Film Institute.<br/><br/>His time at UC Santa Cruz, however, taught him to think, to approach an idea holistically, and to put those thoughts into action, he says. His music degree also came in handy.<br/><br/>&#8220;A lot of music skills are integrated into filmmaking: rhythm and tempo and composition,&#8221; he says by telephone from Morro Bay where he was vacationing with his family. &#8220;There are parallels between film and music.&#8221;<br/><br/>Skloot&#8217;s twin passions of filmmaking and music are nowhere more evident than in a 2009 documentary he directed about a subculture of road-warrior symphony musicians whose cobbled-together freelance jobs meant they often logged as many hours on the road as long-haul truckers. <br/><br/>He&#8217;s also worked on films about brilliant mathematicians, 1960s Oakland, and the last days of a traveling carnival. <br/><br/>&#8220;I think when you make a film, you want to find something that&#8217;s interesting and has meaning,&#8221; he says.<br/><br/> For his <em>4 Wheel Bob</em> movie, a short article about Coomber hiking Bay Area trails and a photo of Coomber backlit on a mountaintop piqued his interest. He met Coomber, who besides his hiking adventures is a council member for the city of Livermore, and they went for a hike. <br/><br/>&#8220;Something struck me emotionally about his story,&#8221; Skloot says. &#8220;It was the general concept about overcoming your limitations and facing challenges head on.&#8221;<br/><br/>Coomber, who had turned down another filmmaker who&#8217;d wanted to document his adventures, listened to Skloot&#8217;s proposal.<br/><br/>&#8220;He comes across as very honest and genuine,&#8221; Coomber says of Skloot. He agreed to the project.<br/><br/>Skloot followed Coomber as he led hikes and spoke to others who were disabled by accidents or illness. When Coomber decided to hike Kearsarge Pass, Skloot brought his cameras. <br/><br/>His crew captured Coomber struggling over the rock steps, sometimes dropping to the ground in order to lug the chair over the barriers. He filmed Coomber&#8217;s blistered hands, his conversation with birds and with the dogs he met on the trail.<br/><br/>&#8220;Sometimes seeing Bob struggle up the hill, it was hard not to help him,&#8221; Skloot says. &#8220;But I realized he had to do it on his own. That this was his personal struggle.&#8221;<br/><br/>The result is a film that Skloot hopes carries a universal message about facing challenges and the healing power of nature. <br/><br/>&#8220;I was deeply moved by being around Bob,&#8221; says Skloot who also teaches filmmaking at Diablo Valley College and Sonoma State University. &#8220;While Bob isn&#8217;t a fan of the word &#8216;inspiration,&#8217; when you look at him doing these things and see the determination, and yet generosity, as he meets people, I was inspired to grumble a little less and try to do things that have meaning.&#8221;<br/><br/>The message of the film, Coomber says, is all about not giving up. <br/><br/>&#8220;Your situation might change so one day you go from walking to being in a wheelchair,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but you need to keep exploring your own limits. There&#8217;s a way to do damn near everything.&#8221;<br/><br/>4 Wheel Bob <em>is scheduled to be screened Oct. 14 at the Santa Cruz Film Festival.</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7ac333a807270176705df1ab3185c10"><name>oklahoma-earthquakes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New analysis casts doubt on predicted decrease in Oklahoma earthquakes</title><summary>Seismologists say a significant seismic hazard continues despite recent reductions in injection of wastewater from oil and gas production.</summary><keywords>Emily Brodsky, Thomas Goebel, induced seismicity, injection-induced earthquakes</keywords><start-date>1502301600000</start-date><display-name>New analysis casts doubt on predicted decrease in Oklahoma earthquakes</display-name><path>/2017/08/oklahoma-earthquakes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/oklahoma-earthquakes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1502293536350</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1503439074485</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/cushing-damage-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/cushing-damage-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cushing-damage-400.jpg</name><display-name>cushing-damage-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>122178</file-size><width>400</width><height>560</height></image><image-alt>damage from Cushing earthquake</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/seismometer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/seismometer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seismometer-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>seismometer-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22013</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>worker installing seismometer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Damage to buildings in Cushing, Oklahoma, from the magnitude 5.0 earthquake on November 6, 2016.

Injection rates have declined recently because of regulatory actions and market forces, but seismologists say that has not yet significantly reduced the risk of potentially damaging earthquakes.</p>
<p>A new analysis led by seismologists at UC Santa Cruz, published August 9 in <em>Science Advances</em>, found that the probability of moderate earthquakes this year in the affected areas of Oklahoma is two times higher than was suggested by an earlier analysis. The <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/11/e1601542">earlier study, published in November 2016</a>, predicted that reduced wastewater injection would lead to substantially less seismic activity, with widely felt earthquakes of magnitude 3 or more decreasing significantly by the end of 2016 and approaching historic levels within a few years.</p>
<p>"Although they were correct in saying that small earthquakes seemed to be decreasing, the moderate earthquakes are not decreasing. The problem has not been resolved to where we can stop worrying about it," said coauthor Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>As if to underscore the new findings, central Oklahoma experienced a series of earthquakes last week, including a magnitude 4.2 temblor Wednesday night (August 2) that knocked out power in Edmond, near Oklahoma City. State seismologist Jacob Walter, a coauthor of the new paper, said it was the fourth earthquake of magnitude 4 or greater in 2017. The rate of such earthquakes is somewhat lower than in 2016, he said, but they continue to pose a hazard.</p>
<p>"There is still a significant seismic hazard in Oklahoma, and it's not going to taper off as fast as the earlier paper suggested," Walter said.</p>
<p>First author Thomas Goebel, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz, said his interest was piqued by some strong statements in the earlier paper, such as the prediction that seismicity would fall to historic levels within a few years, which he found puzzling. He noted that there were two large earthquakes in late 2016, the magnitude 5.8 Pawnee and magnitude 5.0 Cushing earthquakes, and these and other large earthquakes occurred when injection rates were relatively low.</p>
<p>Given the important implications regarding seismic hazards, Goebel and Brodsky decided to take a closer look at the original data and do their own analysis. For expertise on the seismic conditions in Oklahoma, they worked with Walter and a hydrogeologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey, Kyle Murray.</p>
<p>The researchers used the same statistical model of injection-induced seismicity that was used in the earlier paper, but their analysis suggested a much higher probability of moderate earthquakes in 2017 (80 percent versus 37 percent). They also found no evidence suggesting that earthquake probabilities would be as low as historic values by 2025.</p>
<p>Walter said the Oklahoma Geological Survey is continuing to evaluate the effects of the reductions in wastewater injections. He noted that studies of injection-induced seismicity have found that there can be a substantial lag between injections and the occurrence of earthquakes. "If there's a lag in the occurrence of induced earthquakes, we expect there might be a similar lag in any effects of a reduction in injections," Walter said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7d20fea807270176705df1ae408cf72"><name>uc-learning-center</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The UC Learning Center is live</title><summary>The UC Learning Center is now available for you to access.</summary><keywords>uc learning center</keywords><start-date>1502175600000</start-date><display-name>UC Learning Center is live</display-name><path>/2017/08/uc-learning-center</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/uc-learning-center</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1502296017701</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1502296017701</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The UC Learning Center is now available for you to access!

<p>The award recognizes Partch "for her ground-breaking combination of biophysics and cell biology that is defining how protein conformational changes control circadian clock timing."</p>
<p>Partch studies the biological clock that drives the daily ("circadian") rhythms of cells throughout the body. By focusing on how the clock works on the molecular level, her research can help scientists understand and treat disorders in which the timing of the biological clock is disrupted. She is investigating the role of clock disruption in cancer and other human health problems</p>
<p>The Dayhoff award honors the memory of Margaret Dayhoff, former president of the Biophysical Society, and is given to a woman who holds very high promise or has achieved prominence while developing the early stages of a career in biophysical research within the purview and interest of the Biophysical Society. Partch will be honored at an award ceremony during the Biophysical Society&#8217;s annual meeting in San Francisco in February 2018.</p>
<p>The Biophysical Society, founded in 1958, is a professional, scientific society established to encourage development and dissemination of knowledge in biophysics.

<p>However, a recent analysis suggests that five social-psychological factors helped power the reality-star candidate to victory: authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, prejudice, relative deprivation, and intergroup contact.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/750/html?t=1&amp;cn=ZmxleGlibGVfcmVjc18y&amp;refsrc=email&amp;iid=ddaa72fbb4b64454854fea56e6e2fc1b&amp;uid=1188008143&amp;nid=244+272699400">commentary</a> published in the <em>Journal of Social and Political Psychology</em>, research professor Thomas Pettigrew of the University of California, Santa Cruz, writes that these five social-psychological phenomena combined with political factors to produce the unprecedented outcome.<br/><br/><strong>Authoritarianism and social dominance orientation</strong></p>
<p>Authoritarianism as a syndrome is characterized by deference to authority, aggression toward outgroups, a rigidly hierarchical view of the world, and resistance to new experiences, according to Pettigrew, an expert on racism and intergroup relations whose scholarship has led the field of social psychology for more than five decades.</p>
<p>"Authoritarianism is typically triggered by threat and fear, and authoritarians tend to view the world as a very dangerous and threatening place," writes Pettigrew, adding that it typically begins early in life as an aspect of personality and leads to some form of right-wing political ideology.</p>
<p>Social dominance orientation is marked by a preference for social hierarchy and domination over lower-status groups. People who exhibit this preference tend to be driven, disagreeable, and relatively uncaring seekers of power. They describe themselves as motivated by self-interest and self-indulgence.</p>
<p>While polling of voters by political parties and news organizations focuses on which candidates are in the lead, surveys by social scientists dive deeper in an effort to identify the factors that prompt voters to support one candidate over another. Pettigrew's analysis is based on the review of numerous such surveys, including one conducted eight months before the election by Matthew MacWilliams, who predicted that election surveys were underestimating Trump's support, and one by Stanley Feldman, professor of political science at Stony Brook University, who found a positive correlation between authoritarianism and support for Trump among Republicans.</p>
<p>In the United States and throughout the world, authoritarianism is more common among the political right than the left. Republicans in the U.S. began averaging higher on authoritarianism than Democrats before Trump's candidacy, but "it remained for Trump to break the unwritten rules of American politics and appeal directly and openly to authoritarians and those who score high on social dominance orientation," writes Pettigrew.</p>
<p>Trump uses terms such as "losers" and "complete disasters," which are classic authoritarian statements, says Pettigrew, citing recent studies that reveal that Trump supporters tend to score especially high on measures of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. The power of these two factors to predict far-right voting behavior has also been documented in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom, notes Pettigrew.<br/><br/><strong>Prejudice</strong></p>
<p>Trump supporters are also characterized by prejudice&#8212;racial prejudice as well as prejudice against immigrants and outgroups in general. Trump's blatant use of prejudice against "dangerous" Muslims and Mexican "rapists" is a departure from the Republican Party's previous more subtle appeals to bigotry&#8212;and his dedicated followers loved it, says Pettigrew.</p>
<p>"Breaking with so-called 'political correctness,' (Trump) blared openly what they had been saying privately," he writes.<br/><br/><strong>Intergroup contact</strong></p>
<p>Pettigrew cites growing evidence that Trump's white supporters have far less contact with minorities than other Americans, and he notes research that found that Trump's regional support increased with greater distance from the Mexican border.</p>
<p>"Throughout the world, intergroup contact has been shown typically to diminish prejudice by reducing intergroup fear and inducing empathy," writes Pettigrew.<br/><br/><strong>Relative deprivation</strong></p>
<p>Pettigrew challenges the widely reported idea that Trump voters were economically deprived, unemployed, angry working-class voters, citing evidence that the median annual income of Trump supporters was nearly $82,000.</p>
<p>Rather than a lack of social mobility, Trump voters suffer from "relative deprivation," which Pettigrew explains is the result of disappointing comparisons&#8212;whether those impressions are based in fact or not.</p>
<p>"Trump adherents feel deprived relative to what they expected to possess at this point in their lives and relative to what they erroneously perceive other 'less deserving' groups have acquired," writes Pettigrew.</p>
<p>Relative deprivation among Trump supporters is fed by financial stresses, including the rapidly rising cost of housing, prescription drugs, and college tuition; diminished savings that may not allow the ideal retirement; and anxiety that their children may not achieve more than they have.</p>
<p>"Trump voters are typically not personally economically destitute, but they often feel deprived relative to their hopes and expectations," explains Pettigrew.</p>
<p>Trump exploited that sense of relative deprivation brilliantly, using language that appealed to his target audience and unifying his supporters against the common "enemies": the media, immigrants, and the so-called "elite." Pettigrew notes that Trump's slogan "Make America great again" harkens back to an era when the country was led by white men, when immigration was restricted, racial segregation was in place, and the government's affirmative action programs&#8212;such as the G.I. Bill and federal housing loans&#8212;largely benefited white men.<br/><br/><strong>Capitalizing on real and imagined threats</strong></p>
<p>These five phenomena make people feel vulnerable to real and perceived threats, but Trump is far from the first authoritarian leader to attract followers by exploiting the perception of threats&#8212;and offering simple solutions.</p>
<p>Pettigrew notes similarities between the Trump insurgency and previous movements, including the Tea Party movement, the Wallace movement in the 1960s, and the Know Nothing movement in the 1850s. Pettigrew also noted parallels with contemporary far-right movements in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands that are fueled by white male nationalists and populists who are less educated than the general population.</p>
<p>Genuine threats, including terrorism, conflict, and the recent Great Recession, combine with imagined threats&#8212;Trump's false claims of massive voter fraud, out-of-control crime, and unvetted immigration&#8212;to foster unease among those who have seen great change in their communities.</p>
<p>Pettigrew cites the Brexit vote to highlight the "delicate balance between threat and contact&#8212;the dual effects of diversity." The greatest support for Brexit was concentrated in areas where immigrant populations had grown by more than 200 percent between 2000 and 2015; a stunning 94 percent of voters in those regions opted to leave the European Union. Residents of London and other big cities had become comfortable with immigrants over time, whereas residents of small towns that had experienced a sudden influx of immigrants perceived the demographic shift as a threat and lacked sufficient intergroup contact to allay their fears.&#160; A similar phenomenon emerged in the Trump election in small Midwestern towns. <br/><br/><strong>Social psychology and politics</strong></p>
<p>Pettigrew emphasizes that it was the interplay of social-psychological phenomena and politics that generated the unexpected election outcome. Neither element can be overlooked in the quest to understand Trump's ascent to the presidency.</p>
<p>"Politics and social-psychological factors aren't in conflict; they work at different levels," explains Pettigrew. The biggest political factors are structural: party loyalty and the structure of the American political system. "Some voters will automatically vote Republican out of party loyalty&#8212;even if they voted against Trump in the primary," he adds.</p>
<p>For those who wonder how the country could elect its first African American president in 2008 followed by Trump, Pettigrew points out that about 58 percent of whites voted against Barack Obama in 2008&#8212;and 59 percent of whites voted for Trump in 2016.</p>
<p>About one-fifth of American voters are dedicated to the authoritarian outlook marked by prejudice and relative deprivation, "and Trump plays them like a harp," says Pettigrew. "They're not going to change much."</p>
<p>Pettigrew says the political landscape is in the hands of young voters. "All of these social-psychological factors are phenomena of later middle age and older people, and we're dying off," the 86-year-old says with a wink. "The new generation that's coming on, even in the South, really is different."</p>
<p>Moreover, Trump may shape the lifelong voting habits of today's young people, adds Pettigrew, citing research that shows many voters' political allegiances are forged as they come of age. "Young people who came of age under Roosevelt were lifelong Democrats, while Reagan had an enormous effect on young Republican voters," says Pettigrew. "I'm hoping the cohort coming on now won't forget Trump until their dying day."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d260922d807270176705df1aa5dc0313"><name>falcon-kzsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tuning in to social justice</title><summary>Professor-turned-radio show producer Sylvanna Falcón talks about the importance of public scholarship in the Trump era.&#13;

<p>Broadcast every week, the radio talk show features interviews with public intellectuals, political activists, creative artists, and other community members about the urgent issues facing communities of color in the current administration.</p>
<p>Producing the program is <a href="https://sylvannafalcon.sites.ucsc.edu/">Sylvanna Falc&#243;n</a>, an associate professor in the Latin American and Latino Studies Department.</p>
<p>With an administration threatening the freedom of women, immigrants, and people of color, Falc&#243;n wanted a relevant radio program for anyone wanting a deeper understanding of issues in contemporary politics.</p>
<p>Falc&#243;n is no stranger to radio.</p>
<p>As a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara, Falc&#243;n helped run a radio show on the college station KCSB called <em>Voices for Global Justice</em>. The program was launched after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as a way to critically analyze the changing political and media landscape.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Barbara, Falcon met KZSC&#8217;s current program adviser, Keith Rozendal. Falc&#243;n was wanting return to college radio and when she discovered that Rozendal was now at UC Santa Cruz, she immediately reached out to learn about KZSC and about new ways to collaborate.</p>
<p>Rozendal told Falc&#243;n that in addition to volunteering at the station for 20 hours per quarter, she had to take their <em>Intro to Radio</em> class, a required course that teaches students everything about radio from its history and culture to FCC rules and regulations, audio production skills, interviewing techniques and other important skills to be a DJ at the station.</p>
<p>So in fall quarter of 2016, the Latin American and Latino Studies professor became a student again: taking classes, studying for quizzes, and writing papers. As part of the <em>Intro to Radio</em> class, she shadowed the radio host of the long running show called Jazz Kitty. This radio mentor guided her through all the elements and responsibilities of the on-air studio during the Jazz Kitty shows.</p>
<p>The result of all that hard work? <em>Voces Cr&#237;ticas/Critical Voices</em>.</p>
<p>Voces Cr&#237;ticas/Critical Voices aired its first show on January 17, 2017. It dealt exclusively with telling listeners about support available for undocumented students at UC Santa Cruz, a population feeling incredibly vulnerable with a new president threatening deportation. A few days later its <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kzsc/womens-marches-with-lisa-rofel-felicity-schaeffer">second program</a> focused on the women&#8217;s marches and the significance of social movements. Other programs explored other pressing topics, including <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kzsc/an-interview-w-prof-patrick-lopez-aguado-abt-incarceration_july-6-2017">racism in the prison system</a>&#160;with sociologist Patrick Lopez-Aguado, the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kzsc/interview-w-bettina-aptheker-about-activism-blm-politics_june-6-2017">power of activism and importance of Black Lives Matter</a>&#160;with feminist, activist, and distinguished professor Bettina Aptheker, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kzsc/an-interview-w-vijay-prashad-abt-resistance_may-2-9-2017">fake news, Trump, and the limitations of resistance</a> with journalist and scholar Vijay Prashad.</p>
<p>In the following Q-and-A, Falc&#243;n shares what running a show is all about.</p>
<h3>What first attracted you to radio?</h3>
<p>Sylvanna Falc&#243;n (SF): I really never thought the radio would be an outlet for me until I started graduate school in Sociology at UC Santa Barbara. One of my primary advisors, Avery Gordon, co-hosted a radio show with Elizabeth Robinson called No Alibis on <a href="http://www.kcsb-radio.dreamhosters.com/">KCSB</a>. I remember appreciating their ability to have such thoughtful conversations on air. Many of us as graduate students listened to the show regularly. The late Cedric Robinson also had an award winning show called <a href="http://www.kcsb-radio.dreamhosters.com/third-world-news-review-receives-2015-media-access-impact-award/">Third World News Review</a>&#160;which he started with a graduate student. His partner Elizabeth Robinson eventually joined the show, which also aired on the local public access tv channel, and together, they shared such deft critical analysis about politics and the news for three decades. So these scholars were modeling a type of public intellectualism I really admired. One of the most important things we do as part of our jobs is teach and there&#8217;s nothing that says teaching can only happen in the classroom. And the privilege of being on the radio now has meant I can merge my scholarly curiosity with my skills as a teacher in a different capacity and reach an incredibly wide audience. KZSC reaches 3 million people in three different counties and even more people online. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<h3>Why is radio important to you now?</h3>
<p>SF: We are living in frightening and uncertain times. The radio has given me an opportunity in which to channel some of my frustration about the state of the world into something positive. And by positive I do not mean necessarily uplifting and happy, though I wish that would be more of the case. But positive in that I am using my feminist and sociological training and my ability to speak to an interdisciplinary audience, to provide and advance a critique and analysis that is sorely needed at this time. I can do some of this of course in my publications and in my conference presentations but my goal is to reach people beyond the academy because we must see our lives as deeply interconnected. The radio has really become an ideal media outlet for me, and to be honest it is really a lot of fun. I wanted to have fun again too.</p>
<h3>What is it like being involved with a college radio station?</h3>
<p>SF: I absolutely love it. It&#8217;s really incredible as a professor to be in a space that is managed by students. The students are so dedicated and really have created a culture at the station that is warm and inviting. It has just been such an enriching experience for me personally. And I love the flipping of roles here where I need to be the one to check in with students (for example, the station manager or the Program Review Committee) about this or that rather than them checking with me. Plus, as a professor, I am categorized as a community member, which means students get priority for air time over me until I become an anchor show, which refers to a show that has been on the air for four consecutive years. It is important that students be the priority at KZSC to get the media training they need to be successful once they graduate.</p>
<h3>Why is engaging the public with thoughtful conversations so important to you?</h3>
<p>SF: At a time where divisions feel insurmountable, dialogue becomes more necessary than ever. As a society, we have become so reliant on our technology that we have forgotten how to genuinely connect with each other. And so connecting with my show&#8217;s guests through thoughtful conversation is incredibly fulfilling. The three core elements that go into the planning of every single show are the following: taking the time needed to prepare for an interview, thinking about the right questions that will generate the kind of conversation I think the KZSC audience deserves, and offering a meaningful public service that fulfills the <a href="http://ucop.edu/uc-mission/index.html">UC mission</a>.</p>
<h3>As an academic talking with often other academics, how do you make sure the conversation is accessible to students and the wider community?</h3>
<p>SF: When I interview other academics I mention avoiding jargon because you can have an intelligent conversation without it. So it has been fairly easy to make sure this happens. I also draw on the active listening skills I have developed as a qualitative researcher and ask follow-up questions to clarify points if needed. And I think when I interview academics they fall into teacher&#8217;s mode and so are quite effective in explaining their various points thoughtfully.</p>
<h3>What are some of the biggest challenges of being on radio, and how did you deal with it?</h3>
<p>SF: I had to acquire an entirely new media technology skill set from learning how to pre-record interviews to learning how to manage all of the responsibilities when live on air without getting nervous to working with new software programs to edit shows for eventually uploading online so that my shows can reach an even wider audience. I remain on a learning curve and so not getting frustrated if it maybe takes me longer to acquire these new skills has been challenging. But in the end though I have learned these skills so that feels satisfying too, especially because the shows have gotten better over time.</p>
<h3>How can people get involved in your show?</h3>
<p>S.F: Anyone who wants to get involved at the station must volunteer for 20 hours first. I would also encourage people to check out the KZSC schedule, which changes every quarter, in order to see the wide variety of music and news/talk/public affairs shows that air on the station. For anyone interested in collaborating on my show, I would encourage them to email kzsc.voices@gmail.com to discuss the possibility. There are opportunities to collaborate with other hosts on existing programs too so if having a voice and space on the radio is of interest, then definitely take the initiative and reach out.</p>

He will serve on an interim basis until a permanent athletics director is hired.</p>
<p>Warzecka, who starts Monday (Aug. 14), served as the UC Davis athletics director for 16 years, successfully leading the program through its transition from Division II to Division I. He worked at American River College as dean of kinesiology and athletics from 2012&#8211;15.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe Greg brings the perfect mix of subject matter expertise and leadership approach needed to successfully guide the Slug program at this critical time,&#8221; Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham said.</p>
<p>Warzecka served as athletics director for University of Redlands, a Division III program, before he joined UC Davis in 1995. He holds&#160;a BA in physical education from UC Berkeley and a master&#8217;s in athletic administration from CSU Hayward.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has engaged Collegiate Sports Associates to lead the search for the permanent athletics director.<br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d2cf78be807270176705df1aa619dbc4"><name>chasing-eclipse-with-douglas-duncan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chasing the eclipse</title><summary>Douglas Duncan, director of the Fiske Planetarium at the University of Colorado, and a distinguished UC Santa Cruz astronomy grad, is leading an eclipse-watching trip to Wyoming. </summary><start-date>1502478000000</start-date><display-name>uc santa cruz astronomy grads lead solar eclipse trip</display-name><path>/2017/08/chasing-eclipse-with-douglas-duncan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/chasing-eclipse-with-douglas-duncan</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1502480397297</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1502480397297</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/spaceman-doug-photo-resized.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/spaceman-doug-photo-resized.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spaceman-doug-photo-resized.jpg</name><display-name>spaceman-doug-photo-resized.jpg</display-name><file-size>41665</file-size><width>350</width><height>197</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/spaceman-doug-thumb</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/spaceman-doug-thumb</link><site>news</site><name>spaceman-doug-thumb</name><display-name>spaceman-doug-thumb</display-name><file-size>19198</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span>Douglas Duncan, who earned his Ph.

<p>He&#8217;s followed these black and luminous visions in the sky from China to the Galapagos. Duncan once shot footage of an eclipse at the moment of totality in Baja California. Play back the video and you can hear a crowd of excitable college students roaring profanities at the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;A total eclipse looks like the end of the world,&#8221; Duncan noted drily. &#8220;It makes you say some colorful things. You don&#8217;t say &#8216;wow&#8217; or &#8216;holy cow.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>Next week, Duncan, who earned his Ph. D in astronomy from UC Santa Cruz in 1980, and is now director of the Fiske Planetarium at the University of Colorado, will lead an eager throng of like-minded eclipse chasers to Grand Tetons National Park in Wyoming, where he and a healthy contingent of other UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs, will gather to lecture and learn about the eclipse before taking in the big event itself on August 21<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Excitement is building because this will be an exceedingly rare &#8220;coast to coast&#8217;&#8217; solar eclipse in which a 70-mile-wide band of shadow, made possible by the moon slipping between the earth and the sun, will rush eastward from the Oregon coast to South Carolina. The last coast-to-coaster was 99 years ago. The <em>New York Times</em> recently estimated that 100 million people live insider or close to this &#8220;path of totality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of those people will be looking at the sky &#8211; with special protective sunglasses, of course.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t expect Duncan to curb his enthusiasm beforehand. Duncan, who is quoted frequently in publications such as the <em>Washington Post</em>, has become one of the most vocal cheerleaders for the eclipse. Long drives? Gigantic crowds? Traffic jams? Forget about it. Duncan says any inconvenience would be well worth it, considering this is the event of a lifetime. &#160;&#8220;This is something you will not forget to your dying day,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Duncan has led several other full solar eclipse trips in other parts of the world. He&#8217;s even developed an online Coursera course about the sun and the 2017 eclipse to prepare as many people as possible for &#8216;totality.&#8217; He and three of his astronomer colleagues recently secured a grant that helped them provide &#8216;eclipse education&#8217; resources <a href="http://www.starnetlibraries.org/2017eclipse/">to 7,000 libraries</a> and viewing centers all over the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Planning ahead </strong></p>
<p>Duncan predicted that there would be an eclipse frenzy this year, so he planned ahead &#8211; <em>way </em>ahead, in fact.</p>
<p>Four years ago, he found a grand old hotel in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that he knew would be perfect for his informal eclipse-watching symposium, so he approached the front desk with a unique request. &#8220;I said, &#8216;I would like rooms for 300 people four years from now. I gave them the deposit.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>It was a powerful feeling. He said he felt as if &#8220;I owned the rooms.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>Some of the guests booked way in advance. One of them, Meg Corman, special assistant to UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal, made reservations for the Wyoming trip two years ago. &#8220;I met Doug during the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration, and he told me about the trip,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I talked to my friends about it. Now there are six of us going!&#8221;</p>
<p>Duncan&#8217;s eclipse event will be a reunion of sorts for UC Santa Cruz graduates. In fact, he estimates that two thirds of the speakers went to UC Santa Cruz, including astronaut Steve Hawley (Ph.D., astronomy and astrophysics,1977) and astronomer Nick Suntzeff (Ph.D, astronomy and astrophysics, 1980.)Duncan was at UC Santa Cruz from 1973 to 1980. While he was here, he forged lasting connections with faculty and administration. For instance, &#8220;my cosmology professor was a guy named George Blumenthal,&#8221; he noted with a chuckle, referring to the current chancellor of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>If you are one of the throngs of people heading out for Oregon, Wyoming, and other eclipse-zone &#8216;dark spots,&#8217; prepare to witness some wild behavior &#8211; and not just among your fellow human beings. In 1998, in the Galapagos, five minutes before totality, Duncan was on a boat. Suddenly something peculiar happened. &#8220;Every whale and dolphin in the vicinity swam back and forth&#8217;&#8217; during the total eclipse. Then they vanished. &#8220;We were there 10 days and didn&#8217;t see them again,&#8221; Duncan said.</p>
<p>Asked to explain this strange occurrence, Duncan explained that these sea creatures live close to the equator and are accustomed to 12 hours of light for most days of the year. Naturally, they were flummoxed when nighttime came and vanished so quickly. &#8220;I figure they came up to see what was going on,&#8217;&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>In 1994, during a total eclipse in Bolivia, Duncan and his cohorts were staring up at the sky. Then someone excitedly shouted, &#8220;look down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We looked down, and we were surrounded by llamas,&#8221; Duncan said. &#8220;No one saw where they came from. When the eclipse was over, they kind of got in a line and marched away.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a university we denounce the abhorrent ideology of white supremacy and white nationalism that haunts communities nationwide, and we send our thoughts and prayers to the families and friends of those who were killed and injured.</p>
<p>Our country's great strength stems from its diversity, from the contributions of people of all colors, creeds and cultures. We must celebrate our differences, and without hesitancy reject any expression of intolerance, bigotry or hatred that runs counter to the American ideal that we are all equals.</p>

<p>The traps are designed to determine the presence and extent of any infestation. If an infestation were to develop in the Santa Cruz region, Asian gypsy moth caterpillars would threaten nearby forests and local oaks as well as many other hardwoods, evergreens, manzanita, cottonwood, willow and other species. Asian gypsy moths are also a threat to agricultural crops such as fruit trees.</p>
<p>Pest detection traps are routinely deployed and inspected by Santa Cruz County Agricultural Commissioner staff as part of a statewide pest detection program aimed at monitoring and preventing the spread of harmful pests in California. In response to the detection, additional traps are being set throughout the city and the surrounding region in a cooperative effort with the United States Department of Agriculture, the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and the County of Santa Cruz Agricultural Commissioner&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>If additional detection efforts determine that a larger infestation exists, the USDA will convene a technical working group of scientists and experts who will be charged with assessing the situation and determining next steps. Previous infestations in California and other states have been eradicated using an organic-approved treatment called Btk (Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki), a naturally occurring bacteria found in soil. It has not yet been determined whether or what form of remediation would occur in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A female Asian gypsy moth can fly up to 25 miles and lay up to 1,500 eggs, making early detection of an infestation especially important. Caterpillar can eat up to one square foot of leaves per day, potentially feeding on hundreds of tree species.</p>
<p>The Asian gypsy moth&#8217;s egg masses are frequently detected on ships and shipping containers inbound from Asia, Russia and other infested regions. Eggs are also known to be transported on outdoor furniture, recreational vehicles, firewood and other portable items.</p>
<p>Residents with questions or concerns about trapping activities are encouraged to call CDFA&#8217;s Pest Hotline at 800&#8211;491&#8211;1899.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e786ef37807270176705df1a5fbd4fbd"><name>cdo-message-charlottesville</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>No place for hate at UC Santa Cruz</title><start-date>1502780400000</start-date><display-name>Campus message</display-name><path>/2017/08/cdo-message-charlottesville</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/cdo-message-charlottesville</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1502827965021</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1502827965021</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear UC Santa Cruz Campus Community,</p>

<p>Lauren Nadler will become the new head coach for women&#8217;s soccer. She has been the assistant coach in the women&#8217;s soccer program since fall 2015. She brings several years of coaching experience from campuses including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, City College of San Francisco, and Dominican University of California.</p>
<p>David Klech has been named the new head coach for men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s track and field and cross country. He has served as the assistant coach in the program since 2016. He coached at Acalanes High School and also served as a volunteer assistant coach at his alma mater, the University of Oregon, where he was an All-American in track and field.</p>
<p>The new men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s swim and dive head coach will be Matt Nauman. Nauman, who is also a UC Santa Cruz alum, has been an assistant coach with the program since 2010. He has also coached with the Cabrillo Threshers and Aptos Cabrillo Swim Club.</p>
<p>Interim Athletics Director Greg Warzecka praised the new hires.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe these are three strong coaches who will continue to build upon these already successful programs and lead the Slugs to a bright future,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ecfa658c807270176705df1a21dbfabc"><name>coastal-flooding</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Florida flood risk study identifies priorities for property buyouts</title><summary>A study of flood damage in Florida proposes prioritizing property buyouts based on flood risk, ecological value, and socioeconomic conditions.</summary><keywords>Juliano Calil, repetitive loss properties, coastal flooding, sea level rise, hurricanes</keywords><start-date>1502982000000</start-date><display-name>Florida flood risk study identifies priorities for property buyouts</display-name><path>/2017/08/coastal-flooding</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/coastal-flooding</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1502919418036</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1502982635025</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/florida-rlp-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/florida-rlp-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>florida-rlp-410.jpg</name><display-name>florida-rlp-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>77964</file-size><width>410</width><height>373</height></image><image-alt>repetitive loss properties in Florida</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/florida-rlp-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/florida-rlp-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>florida-rlp-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>florida-rlp-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16258</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>repetitive loss properties in Florida</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Locations of repetitive loss properties in Florida are shown in this map.

Forecasters say an above-normal hurricane season is likely in the Atlantic Ocean this year, while a rising sea level is making Florida increasingly vulnerable to dangerous flooding.</p>
<p>The study, published in the <a href="http://cbe.miis.edu/joce/vol4/iss1/4/"><em>Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics</em></a><em>,</em> focused on the problem of "repetitive loss properties" and aimed to identify lands in Florida that are potential targets for projects with multiple benefits: reduced flood exposure, conservation benefits, and remediation of social vulnerability.</p>
<p>The study shows the location of more than 15,000 repetitive loss properties in Florida which, collectively, filed more than 40,000 claims against the National Flood Insurance Program between 1978 and 2011 (more than 1,200 claims per year, on average). As of March 2016, the National Flood Insurance Program, which is up for reauthorization in 2017, owed the U.S. Treasury $23 billion.</p>
<p>"This study identified properties and surrounding land in Florida where buyouts can reduce future flood risk to socially vulnerable communities and simultaneously promote the restoration of the floodplain to a more natural condition," said lead author Juliano Calil. "We identified almost 150 properties in Miami-Dade County alone that are located in areas where these objectives are very well aligned."</p>
<p>As a graduate student in ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, Calil developed methods for assessing coastal risks and identifying coastal areas with potential for remediation projects that can meet multiple objectives. He applied these methods to the California coast in a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/flood-risk-reduction.html">similar study published in 2015</a>, also in collaboration with the Nature Conservancy. Calil earned his Ph.D. in 2017 and is currently a senior fellow at the Center for the Blue Economy, Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in Monterey.</p>
<p>Flood events cause disproportionate impacts on more vulnerable groups, such as the poor, minorities, the elderly, and the disabled, which tend to live in high-risk areas and lack basic resources to prepare for floods and other natural disasters. Incorporating social vulnerability into their analysis was a significant improvement over the 2015 study, Calil noted.</p>
<p>Coauthor Sarah Newkirk, senior coastal project director with the Nature Conservancy in California, said, "Our approach identifies an opportunity to use funding previously designated only for flood mitigation to achieve additional benefits, including valuable social and ecological outcomes."</p>
<p>Flooding is the most common and damaging of all natural disasters in the United States. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 44 of the 46 major disaster declarations in 2016 were related to storms, with flooding being a significant factor in almost 70 percent of them (30 events). In 2016, severe floods in the U.S. resulted in more than $17 billion in damages (six times higher than in 2015). Twelve individual weather and climate events caused more than $1 billion in damages each, and at least five severe 1,000-year precipitation events occurred in the United States in 2016.</p>
<p>The new study proposes that government-funded buyouts, followed by structure demolition or relocation and the restoration of floodplain habitats, can support social, environmental, and economic objectives simultaneously.</p>
<p>"It is important to note that buyouts must be done from willing and volunteer sellers, and relocation projects must be executed in a thoughtful and fair manner," Calil said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ed21e43e807270176705df1ada3d6369"><name>humanities-mellon-acls-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz humanities alumna named 2017 Mellon/ACLS Public Fellow</title><summary>Sophia Magnone (Ph.D. Literature, 2016) is one of 20 new Mellon/ACLS Public Fellows nationwide who will take up two-year assignments working in the fields of policy, civil rights, arts and culture, and the media.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, ucsc news, feminist press, ucsc literature alumni, mellon foundation, acls public fellows, humanities careers</keywords><start-date>1502923200000</start-date><display-name> Humanities alumna named 2017 Mellon/ACLS Public Fellow</display-name><path>/2017/08/humanities-mellon-acls-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/humanities-mellon-acls-fellow</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1502922006359</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1502924355541</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/magnone_acls-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/magnone_acls-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>magnone_acls-375.jpg</name><display-name>magnone_acls-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>168339</file-size><width>375</width><height>562</height></image><image-alt>Sophia Magnone</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/magnone_acls-thumb-best.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/magnone_acls-thumb-best.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>magnone_acls-thumb-best.jpg</name><display-name>magnone_acls-thumb-best.jpg</display-name><file-size>21579</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Sophia Magnone</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Sophia Magnone</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Career-building two-year fellowship provides $67,500 annually for recent humanities Ph.D.s to gain work experience in their field</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz humanities alumna Sophia Magnone has been named a 2017 Mellon/ACLS Public Fellow by the <a href="http://www.acls.org/about/"><strong>American Council of Learned Societies</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Magnone is one of 20 new Mellon/ACLS Public Fellows nationwide who will take up two-year assignments with government agencies and non-profit organizations, working in the fields of policy, civil rights, arts and culture, and the media.</p>
<p>Designed to expand the reach of doctoral education in the humanities, the career-building fellowship allows recent humanities Ph.D.s to gain significant experience in a variety of fields.</p>
<p>The program is made possible by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since ACLS launched the Public Fellows program in 2011, over 100 nonprofits and government offices across the United States have partnered with us to highlight the wealth of career fields where humanities Ph.D.s can not only make an impact, but thrive professionally,&#8221; noted John Paul Christy, director of public programs at ACLS.</p>
<p>&#8220;By contributing their skills and expertise to some of society&#8217;s most pressing issues, like immigration, equity and diversity, and mass incarceration, Public Fellows demonstrate that the humanities Ph.D. has serious practical and public value,&#8221;&#160;he added.</p>
<p>Magnone--who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2016 with a Ph.D. in Literature--said she will be working as Development Manager for the Feminist Press in New York.</p>
<p>Founded in 1970, the Feminist Press is an educational nonprofit organization created to advance women's rights and expand feminist perspectives. It publishes feminist literature from around the world and has become a cutting-edge publisher for books on contemporary feminist issues of equality and gender identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I've had many opportunities in my Ph.D. studies to think about how literature shapes the world beyond the classroom and about the crucial role played by literary works in creating and changing culture,&#8221; said Magnone. &#8220;I'm very excited to translate my experience as a scholar and teacher of feminist literature into the mission-driven work of the Feminist Press.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feminist Press approaches publishing as a project of social justice and public education, and that's very much in line with the core values and skills I've learned as a humanities Ph.D.,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Magnone noted that the Institute for Humanities Research at UC Santa Cruz and the UC-wide graduate career program, Humanists@Work, have been instrumental in helping her figure out her career potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both are doing great work to help graduate students and recent Ph.D.s of the humanities conceptualize non-traditional and/or non-academic career paths,&#8221; said Magnone.</p>
<p>&#8220;These resources were invaluable to me in figuring out that the Public Fellows program was a good fit for me and my goals, and helping me understand the connections between my Ph.D. studies and other forms of public intellectual work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of these paintings celebrate the landscapes and cultures of Central America, as well as the violence and civil wars that racked Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Those conflicts fueled the migration of thousands of Central Americans to San Francisco over three decades, beginning in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Mauricio Ram&#237;rez is an artist, a muralist, and a native San Franciscan who is fascinated by the Mission's murals&#8212;and by the progressive coalition of artists and immigrants that coalesced during those decades.</p>
<p>"I saw these murals created mostly by Mexican Americans and Chicano artists, and I wondered what would make them paint in solidarity with Central Americans," explained Ram&#237;rez, a third-year doctoral student in Latin American and Latino studies whose dissertation focuses on transnational solidarity in Latinx visual art in the San Francisco Bay Area. "Mexican American and Chicano activists were very welcoming."<br/><br/><strong>Rooted in the Chicano rights movement</strong></p>
<p>Scholars have written about the city's support for Central American refugees, the sanctuary movement, and opposition to U.S. intervention in the region, but little about the art that blossomed during the era.</p>
<p>"A lot of the Mexican American artists came from the Chicano rights movement of the 1960s, and theywere against the Vietnam War," said Ram&#237;rez. "A lot were self-taught. They were politically motivated, and one of their outlets was art.</p>
<p>"For newly arrived Central Americans, seeing images from their homelands provided a warm welcome. "They could feel at home, they could feel safer," he said.</p>
<p>Ram&#237;rez earned his B.A. in art from UC Santa Cruz (Oakes, 2012) before getting a M.A. in teaching visual arts from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia in 2014. He puts his art and teaching talents to work every Friday night, teaching art at juvenile hall in San Mateo and San Francisco.</p>
<p>"It's one way of giving back," said Ram&#237;rez, who became immersed in the Mission's mural scene as a high school student. He contributed to murals all over the city as a youth.</p>
<p>With support from the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/humanities-grad-grant.html">Social Science Research Council Dissertation Proposal Development program</a>, Ram&#237;rez spent the summer interviewing muralists, conducting library research, and combing archives to recreate the story of the Mission's murals, particularly those adorning the walls and garage doors of Balmy Alley, a one-block street between 24th Street and 25th Street that is home to the most concentrated collection of murals in the city. Balmy Alley's murals appeared in large numbers in response to a 1984 Artist Call to protest U.S. intervention in Central America; a group of 36 artists created 27 murals in Balmy Alley during the summer of 1985, helping to establish the Mission as a "mural environment." <br/><br/><strong>Three murals</strong></p>

<p>One of the alley's murals, "Culture Contains the Seed of Resistance" painted by Miranda Bergman and O'Brien Thiele, speaks to state-sanctioned violence in Central America. The left panel depicts elders holding black-and-white portraits of victims, "the disappeared," while a youth paints "Resiste" on the wall. On the right side of the mural, smiling campesinos and musicians are pictured with an overflowing cornucopia of tropical fruits, a rainbow river flows in the foreground against a backdrop of agricultural fields, mountains, and sky.</p>

<p>In a 1990 mural titled "Ceasefire" by Juana Alicia, a youth stands proudly against a backdrop of fields and mountains, while the foreground is dominated by the image of two hands raised in resistance, guns pressing into the palms.</p>

<p>A more recent two-panel mural, titled "Missionmakeover" by Tirso Araiza and Lucia Ippolito, is a study in contrasts: On the left, a police officer is handcuffing a young Latino, with a low-rider, a pitbull, and a bus featured prominently; on the right, a bustling 24th Street streetscape is crowded with pedestrians, cyclists, neighbors, and lavishly painted Victorian homes. In the foreground, a uniformed police officer chats with a blonde-haired woman wearing high heels, Starbucks cups in hand and dogs at their feet. <br/><br/><strong>Gentrification</strong><br/><br/>For Ram&#237;rez, the pace of gentrification has added to the urgency of his project.&#160;</p>
<p>"Most of the murals were created by Latinos, and Latinos are being displaced," he said. "What's going to happen to these murals down the line? Will they be protected? Conserved? Whitewashed?"</p>
<p>Ram&#237;rez is interviewing well-known Bay Area artists, such as Ray Patlan and Patricia Rodriguez, as well as leaders of community organizations such as Precita Eyes Muralists Association, a nonprofit that has helped create more than 400 murals throughout San Francisco and is active in preserving existing artwork.</p>
<p>"When people think about murals, they don't think about high art, but some of these murals are impressive works by really talented artists," said Ram&#237;rez.</p>
<p>Ram&#237;rez is one of twelve UC Santa Cruz graduate students who received support from the campus's new <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/humanities-grad-grant.html">Social Science Research Council Dissertation Proposal Development program</a>. Recipients received $5,000 and were invited to attend two dissertation-proposal workshops with doctoral students and their faculty advisers from four other universities. As the lead administrator for the UCSC program, which is hosted by the Institute for Humanities Research and the Graduate Division, Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Tyrus Miller attended the June workshop in Pittsburgh.<br/><br/><br/></p>

His family shared the following thoughts from Theater Arts professor James Bierman about Andrew Doe&#8217;s time at UC Santa Cruz:</strong></p>
<p>Andy Doe was brought to UCSC in 1973 to become the first chairman of the Theater Arts Board of Studies--later called the Theater Arts Department. He and Audrey Stanley were the senior faculty members in the newly declared program, and they took charge of the process of building an academic program from scratch, with the assistance of some existing members of the UCSC faculty and staff, and some other new recruits, myself included. It was an exhilarating process. Under Andy&#8217;s leadership, we were encouraged to dream out loud, and even the most preposterous ideas and fantasies were given earnest consideration if a persuasive argument could be made on their behalf.</p>
<p>In 1973, we had two performing spaces available to us, a (then) new state-of-the-art &#8220;mainstage&#8221; theater designed by Ralph Rapson, the creator of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, and the converted barn theater, which was then much in need of renovation. Andy felt uncomfortable with both of them; the mainstage, because the weight of the technical demands that it made on productions could easily gobble up the budgets we had for them, and the barn, because its uninsulated walls and roof made it nearly impossible to heat during the winter months. Early on, Andy made a formal application to the University for capital funding for a &#8220;black box&#8221; flexible performing space, maintaining that we would eventually receive the building if we stuck to our guns with our request and renewed it every year. This, turned out to be the case, and the X-Space was finally built at about the time of Andy&#8217;s retirement nineteen years later. In the meantime, the barn also got the insulation it desperately needed.</p>
<p>Andy had a way with practicality: When a project was deemed impractical, he embraced the limitations that appeared to make it so, and incorporated them into the design of the project. Working with designer Norvid Roos, for example, he came up with a setting for his production of Euripides&#8217; <em>Hecuba </em>that featured a single enormous tarp draped and configured in various ways that served as the entire setting for the production<em>. </em>His production of Samuel Beckett&#8217;s <em>Murphy </em>in the barn, a landmark project in the history of UCSC theater, used the barn theater stage with almost no dressing other than the wooden beams and posts that held up the building. Murphy&#8217;s attic hideout in the play was literally set in the rafters.</p>
<p>Andy truly loved and encouraged experimentation. He established a line of classes in our curriculum (the 155 courses) that was then reserved for projects that would simply try something new - with little or no concern for their production outcomes. One of these classes, which was devoted to &#8220;found theater spaces,&#8221; resulted in a day-long festival of theater pieces that were staged in a cave, or at the bottom of a deep concrete stairwell, or a particular grove of trees. In this regard, Andy was ahead of his time. The class on found theater spaces anticipated a nascent interest in environmental theater and later site-specific theater. Before he came to Santa Cruz, he had famously brought street theater to the riot-torn LA neighborhood of Watts. Andy was happy to cast off the formalities of established theaters and bring his performances to the people, wherever they gathered. His students were just as likely to mount their work in the Cowell College plaza at lunch time as in the Barn Theater at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>In his <em>Impossible Theater </em>rant, Herbert Blau stated that American theater came of age in the 1950s with the introduction of work by Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett. Andy was of that generation, and he loved both of those authors. His first 155 course at UCSC was devoted to Brecht, and he subsequently organized a quarter-long Beckett festival that featured the stage adaptation of <em>Murphy </em>(produced with Samuel Beckett&#8217;s blessing) along with a variety of other pieces &#8211; long and short. Interestingly enough, as the role of the primary creator of theater shifted from the playwright to the director, Andy sat comfortably on both sides of that transition. He loved working with new playwrights in the development of their work, and was actively engaged with the Magic Theater, working with such playwrights at Sam Shephard, Lynne Kaufman, Wendy MacLeod, Slawomir Mrozek, Tom Strelich, Stephen Wylie, and Martin Epstein to bring their work to San Francisco Bay Area audiences. At UCSC, he was a primary instigator in the creation of the Chautauqua New Play Festival, which has drawn considerable energy and attention in the spring of every academic year since its inception.</p>
<p>At the same time, he celebrated the emergence of directors who were creating works through improvisation and group processes. He traveled to Poland to witness the work of directors like Tadeusz Kantor and Jerzy Grotowski, and he was instrumental in bringing such figures as Lee Breuer, Richard Schechner, Spalding Gray, Luis Valdez, John Lion, John Achorn, Eugene Ionesco, Julie H&#233;bert, Kazimeirz Braun, and Jerzy Grotowski to the UCSC campus-- some of them for extended residences.</p>
<p>For much of his time in Santa Cruz, Andy led two lives. He was a devoted educator, and it was astonishing to consider the number of his former USC and Pomona College students, and UCSC students who went on to make valuable contributions to American theater. He was also a working director who, at the end of the day on campus, would get into his car and commute up to the SF Bay Area for rehearsals. During his tenure here, most of his off-campus creative work was done without leaves from the classroom or the studio. Teaching at UCSC was his day job, but it bled into his professional directing just as his directing inspired his teaching.</p>
<p>There were some crazy things that happened on our stages at UCSC during the Andrew Doe years. Theater pieces like Gertrude Stein&#8217;s <em>Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights </em>or Michael McClure&#8217;s <em>Josephine the Mouse Singer </em>were perplexing to us and to our audiences, and probably would not have been produced if it weren&#8217;t for Andy Doe&#8217;s appetite for trying new things out. Andy was drawn to UCSC in 1973 for the same reason that many of us in the arts came at that time. It was a bold new experiment in public education, and we felt lucky to be included in it. As the theater program&#8217;s first chairperson, Andy embraced the idea of a laboratory theater and encouraged a spirit of experimentation that lingers to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Donations in honor of Andrew Doe can be made to World Wildlife Foundation, Oxfam, or Vermont Public Radio. There will be a memorial celebration of his life on September 23rd.

<p>Make your reservations now, as participating restaurants will be open to the public and offering their regular meal service on these dates.</p>
<p>"Dining for Farmers" supports five decades of leadership in the training of organic farmers and gardeners. More than 1,500 people have graduated from the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, and hundreds of undergraduates have taken advantage of the hands-on learning opportunities available through the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>The Center's research and policy efforts have helped transform the food system, introducing more environmentally sustainable production methods and pushing for greater economic justice for workers.</p>
<p>Center affiliates are also helping campuses across the state adopt more environmentally and socially just practices: buying more local, sustainable, organic food and supporting UC students who face food insecurity with food pantries, dining hall programs, and enrollment in the CalFresh program.<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f699eb4c807270176705df1ac74ee43d"><name>its-search</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Re-opening search for vice chancellor for information technology</title><summary>In consultation with the search committee for vice chancellor for information technology, the CP/EVC’s office has decided to reopen the national search. </summary><keywords>recruitment</keywords><start-date>1503039600000</start-date><display-name>Campus leadership</display-name><path>/2017/08/its-search</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/its-search</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1503080867274</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1503080867274</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In consultation with the search committee for vice chancellor for information technology, the CP/EVC&#8217;s office has decided to <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/leadership-searches/vc-it/index.html">reopen the national search</a>.</p>
<p>The committee felt it had a strong group of initial applicants, and two very good finalists, but ultimately no contract agreement was reached. The committee aims to advertise robustly on this second go-around and to expand the applicant pool.</p>
<p>Although disappointed by the delay, it benefits the entire university for us to find the right person for the post. Information Technology Services is a critical player in our research, academic, and student success, as well as in our business efficiency and effectiveness. ITS has about 250 employees, and they interact with every division on campus.</p>
<p>University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell will continue to serve as the search committee chair to provide continuity, and our hope is to use the same committee members.</p>
<p>Brad Smith, director of information technology services, research and faculty partnerships, and adjunct associate professor of computer engineering, will continue to serve as interim vice chancellor for information technology until the position is filled on a permanent basis.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Office of Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f69f412f807270176705df1a529f304a"><name>policy-electrical-safety</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus review of the draft electrical safety policy BAS-005</title><summary>As required by the standard campus policy review process, Business and Administrative Services is proposing a new policy that addresses workplace safety in the electrical environment.</summary><keywords>campus policy, electrical safety</keywords><start-date>1503039600000</start-date><display-name>Campus policy review</display-name><path>/2017/08/policy-electrical-safety</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/policy-electrical-safety</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1503081217106</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1503081217106</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As required by the standard campus policy review process, Business and Administrative Services is proposing a new policy that addresses workplace safety in the&#160;electrical environment.</p>

I offer Melin and her family the university&#8217;s full support.</p>
<p>Melin&#8217;s parents, Oakland residents Maria Mendoza-Sanchez and Eusebio Sanchez, lived in the U.S. for more than two decades, but were unable to obtain legal status. Maria was a nurse in the oncology and cardiology wing of Highland Hospital, and Eusabio was a truck driver. Melin is a U.S. citizen. She and her sister, an alumna, plan to see their younger sister through two more years of high school. Their younger brother is returning to Mexico with their parents.</p>
<p>California Sen. Dianne Feinstein attempted to intervene on behalf of the family, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rejected the appeal Tuesday.</p>
<p>While the Trump administration has said it will maintain the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which for the past five years has allowed an estimated 700,000 students known as Dreamers to live, work, and study in the United States, the program does not offer permanent protections to them, and no legal protections are extended to their families. This has created massive uncertainty for many students at UC Santa Cruz, throughout the UC system, and across the nation. Many fear their families will be torn apart.</p>
<p>Incidents like these are a reminder of the need for comprehensive immigration reform that allows families to remain together and recognizes the huge contributions that immigrant communities have made to our country.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will continue to provide services and support to all students without regard to immigration status. The campus has a host of programs and services focused on the needs of undocumented students and students dealing with immigration issues, including immigration issues in mixed status families. I encourage staff, students, and faculty to familiarize themselves with the services and resources available to support undocumented students at the <a href="http://">Educational Opportunity Programs</a> office or through the <a href="http://undoc.universityofcalifornia.edu">University of California&#8217;s Undocumented Student Resources</a> website. If students or campus community members need to speak with someone to get or learn about support for undocumented students, please reach out to Anna Campos, 831-459-3048, or Pablo Reguerin, 831-428-2839. The University of California offers <a href="https://law.ucdavis.edu/ucimm/">free legal immigration services</a> to UC undocumented students and immediate family members through the UC Immigrant Legal Services Center.</p>
<p>The UC system also has strongly supported immigrant students. UC President Janet Napolitano, UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20170224/LOCAL1/170229828">Chancellor George Blumenthal</a> and the nine other UC chancellors <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/Statement-of-Principles-in-Support-of-Undocumented-Members-of-UC.pdf">all have pledged</a> to protect the privacy and civil rights of undocumented students.</p>
<p>To members of the UC Santa Cruz community, please consider using the resources above to learn more about undocumented students, about the challenges they face, and about ways you can support them.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Jaye Padgett, Vice Provost, Student Success</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="06dfebb5807270176705df1a82092dc5"><name>bratt-dolores</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alum and independent filmmaker Peter Bratt directs, writes, and produces documentary about labor activist Dolores Huerta</title><summary>Independent filmmaker Peter Bratt, a 1986 politics graduate of Cowell College, has written, directed, and produced a new documentary about legendary labor activist Dolores Huerta. </summary><start-date>1503385200000</start-date><display-name>Bratt-Dolores</display-name><path>/2017/08/bratt-dolores</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/bratt-dolores</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1503353890517</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1503692474688</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/huerta_450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/huerta_450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>huerta_450.jpg</name><display-name>huerta_450.jpg</display-name><file-size>45560</file-size><width>450</width><height>262</height></image><image-alt>Archival photo of Dolores Huerta with a bullhorn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/huerta-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/huerta-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>huerta-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>huerta-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>9326</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Dolores Huerta</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers, is the subject of a new documentary by UC Santa Cruz graduate Peter Bratt.

But he immediately recognized the opportunity to rewrite a chapter of American history that had overlooked Huerta, the co-founder with Cesar Chavez of the first farm workers unions. <br/><br/>And so Bratt said yes. On September 1, his film, <em>Dolores</em>, opens in theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco Bay Area. Already the recipient of numerous accolades and awards, including the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at the San Francisco Film Festival, Dolores does justice to a woman who has dedicated most of her 87 years to fighting for social justice. The film received a 20-minute standing ovation at its Sundance Film Festival premiere.<br/><br/>Which doesn't mean Huerta liked being the center of attention during the making of the film.<br/><br/>"Dolores kicked my butt a few times during the process," Bratt recalled during a recent interview. "Like a lot of activists, she didn&#8217;t want the focus to be on her&#8212;she wanted it to be about organizing and movement building.&#8221;<br/><br/>Bratt, however, was determined to capture the personal story of the woman, as well as the impact of her work. "It was really difficult for her, particularly in the interview process&#8212;which sometimes made it difficult for me," he said. "Watching the first cut with her was a tough experience, because she's in every frame."<br/><br/>Huerta's children impressed upon her the value of her story as an inspiration to others. "They repeatedly told her young Latinas need to see and know her story, that her story could inspire people to action. Once she understood that, she got completely on board," said Bratt. "She's going out (on tour) with the film, using it as an organizing tool, and it is inspiring people to action. As my brother Carlos Santana likes to say, 'Dolores is a force of nature.'"<br/><br/>That ferocity has fueled Huerta's fight for racial and labor justice for more than 60 years. Huerta was a chief strategist of the grassroots organizing, boycotts, lobbying, and campaigning that won rights for farm workers in the 1960s and '70s, and she was an outspoken feminist, on the front lines of struggles for women's rights, as well. She was also the mother of 11 children and a deeply private person.<br/><br/>"People don't know she's a jazz aficionado and an incredible dancer who trained professionally," said Bratt. "She would work 16 hours and then dance the night away. She still does&#8212;she'll dance until two or three o'clock in the morning, and on many occasions during production, she would wear out my crew."<br/><br/>Music and dance became the thematic motif of the film. "That was my way into the film artistically," said Bratt. "I wanted the film to have that movement and musicality&#8212;like Dolores herself."<br/><br/>Bratt's team reviewed seven decades worth of footage. "The process of making a documentary is terrifying," said Bratt, who comes from a background of narrative filmmaking. "You're taking a leap of faith, hoping you'll discover the narrative and visual motif during the process."<br/><br/>Eighteen months into the filmmaking, archival producer Jennifer Petrucelli discovered 16-millimeter footage of an hour-long interview with Huerta and Chavez that became the narrative theme of <em>Dolores</em>.<br/><br/>"I&#8217;ve fallen in love with the documentary medium," said Bratt. "Filmmakers have to be cross trainers these days to stay working. There are challenges to each genre, but I find documentaries to be one of the most exciting. And this one took everything."<br/><br/>It was at UC Santa Cruz that Bratt first entertained the idea of making films. "I took a film class my junior year," he recalled. "I thought it would be a chill, kickback class and we'd get to watch movies all spring."<br/><br/>Instead, he found himself writing a paper a week and analyzing the American musical from a Marxist-feminist perspective. "A light went on for me, writing those critical papers," he said. "I started thinking about how film and television shape our perceptions of the world, and I became interested in training that critical lens on race."<br/><br/>Film provides a platform for asking questions about who holds power and who controls the collective narrative in society, he said. "That's all Santa Cruz&#8212;the critical thinking that comes with a liberal arts education," said Bratt, who remembers having animated discussions with his housemates, and attending dinners at professors' houses. "It was such an exiting time," he said. <br/><br/>Bratt won a Chancellor's Award for his paper about the American musical, and his professor, Vivian Sobchack, encouraged him to think about making films. "Her recommendation got me into NYU's graduate film program," he said.<br/><br/>Bratt's previous films include <em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/04/3707.html">La Mission</a></em>, a 2009 drama about family and masculinity set in the Mission District of San Francisco where Bratt grew up. When Santana approached him more than four years ago about making a film about Huerta, Bratt said it felt like a "cultural directive" from one storyteller to another to fulfill a "historical obligation." The weight of responsibility was eased by excitement about the prospect of presenting a fleshed out version of an iconic figure. Likening Huerta to other champions of the international struggle for social justice&#8212;Martin Luther King, Jr., Gandhi, and Chavez&#8212;Bratt said he wanted to make a film that captured the complexity of this iconic woman.<br/><br/>"When we look back, we sometimes sanitize and homogenize a little bit," said Bratt. "It's natural. We do it with our heroes, those we respect and admire. Does Dolores, the human being, have any regrets? Of course she does. I wanted to explore what those regrets and mistakes were, and how they might inform who she is today. She had 11 children, and so her story is also a story about <em>familia</em>, family."<br/><br/>When Bratt and executive producer Santana launched the project in 2014, no one foresaw the relevance the film would have in 2017. <br/><br/><em>Dolores</em> received its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on the afternoon of January 20&#8212;the day Donald Trump was inaugurated. "The theater almost became like a church," recalled Bratt, speaking two days after white supremacists created mayhem in Charlottesville. "It's amazing to me how relevant and urgent her story is today." <br/><br/>Ever the activist, Huerta is using the film as an organizing tool. "During the Q&amp;A after screenings, she'll get people cheering and chanting, telling the audience to register to vote, to go back to their community and organize," said Bratt. "It's great to march, she says, but it's not enough. You have to organize in your community."<br/><br/>"As a person who wants to inspire social change, I've learned a lot from her. In many ways, she's been a teacher for me."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="06f4f5bb807270176705df1ab106eb8a"><name>launchpad-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Launchpad offers a boost to innovation</title><summary>Launchpad, managed by the Industry Alliances &amp; Technology Commercialization (IATC) Office, will be offering $5,000, $10,000, and $15,000 grants to promising UCSC technologies in science and engineering.

<p>Launchpad, managed by the Industry Alliances &amp; Technology Commercialization (IATC) Office, will be offering $5,000, $10,000, and $15,000 grants to promising UCSC technologies in science and engineering. <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/iatc/commercialization-/services/launchpad-poc-grant-prog.html">Applications will be accepted</a> until Sept. 28.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many great ideas never make it to the marketplace because inventors cannot find the initial funding needed to show the proof-of-concept,&#8221; Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research Mohamed Abousalem said. &#8220;This program will help fill that gap and provide many worthy ideas with the support needed. We are looking for inventions that are on the path for commercialization but just need an initial boost.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program will be awarding a total of $100,000 over the next two academic years. Launchpad is part of the Support Program for Long-term Innovation, Commercialization &amp; Entrepreneurship (SPLICE), a multi-faceted UCSC program to help bring research innovations to the marketplace and spur economic development in the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>Each of UC's 10 campuses is receiving $2.2 million in one-time state funding to further innovation and entrepreneurship efforts as a result of Assembly Bill 2664, signed in fall 2016 by Gov. Brown. Each campus must provide matching funds from private sources.</p>
<p>The Launchpad program is open to students, faculty, and staff who have created innovative technologies that would have demonstrable economic, environmental and/or societal impact, Abousalem said, adding that the technologies must be formally disclosed and assigned to UC Santa Cruz when the application is submitted.</p>
<p>The funding is meant to help campus innovators overcome specific challenges&#8212;increasing the chance of licensing the technology to a for-profit company or establishing a startup company for the purpose of advancing the technology.</p>
<p>Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, said the program will help to fill the gap between basic research in the lab and development of technology usable in industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Launchpad will truly help to push innovative ideas from the research lab to commercial technological applications more quickly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For some projects, seed funding can make a huge impact in determining if the ideas can be pushed over the hurdle towards commercialization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trees are one of the defining characteristics of UC Santa Cruz and the campus entrance is an iconic part of campus,&#8221; said Mike Hanson, interim director of Physical Plant. &#8220;We are looking to replace these trees in the future with native trees that will thrive in our unique landscape.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lombardy poplars typically grow adjacent to creeks or streams, which provide the trees with a constant supply of water.</p>
<p>Crews will spend about two days removing the trees, which will require temporary and intermittent closures of the southbound lanes of Coolidge Drive south of the Cooperage.

The culprit was domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin produced by marine algae and discovered in 1987 as the cause of amnesic shellfish poisoning.</p>
<p>Scientists at UC Santa Cruz have made substantial progress in understanding and predicting the conditions that lead to large blooms of the toxin-producing algae (diatoms called <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>). But one aspect of these toxic algal blooms, which affect wildlife as well as economically important fisheries, remains a mystery: how do the algae make domoic acid and what triggers its production?</p>
<p>Marilou Sison-Mangus, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, explains that the algae do not always produce the toxin. "There are blooms of <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> every spring and summer along the California coast, but the toxicity varies a lot," she says. "For the seafood industry, this toxin can have a big impact, so we want to understand the mechanisms behind its production. It's a 30-year-old question."</p>
<p>A new grant from NOAA's Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (ECOHAB) Program will fund a research project led by Sison-Mangus to answer that question. Her co-investigators on this interdisciplinary project include chemistry professor Phil Crews and statistician Juhee Lee, assistant professor of applied math and statistics. The NOAA grant provides $130,000 per year for three years, but only the first year of funding is guaranteed. Funding for subsequent years depends on the availability of future NOAA appropriations.</p>
<p>Sison-Mangus's lab at UC Santa Cruz has been investigating the role of bacteria in the production of domoic acid by algae. It turns out that <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> itself does not have all the genes needed to synthesize the toxin.</p>
<p>"We think one of the precursors needed for domoic acid synthesis is produced by bacteria," Sison-Mangus said. "If that's the case, we may be able to use the presence of the bacteria as a marker to predict the toxicity of the algae."</p>
<p>Previous experiments by Sison-Mangus and others have shown that bacteria-free cultures of <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> are not able to produce domoic acid, while adding bacteria to the cultures restores toxin production. She has found that marine bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes, alone or in combination with other bacteria, consistently induce a big spike in domoic acid production in cultures of three different <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> species.</p>
<p>Sison-Mangus has also monitored algal blooms in Monterey Bay and found a close correlation between domoic acid levels and the presence of Bacteroidetes bacteria in association with <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>. Electron microscope images show the bacteria living on the outer surface of the algal cells.</p>
<p>"We know these bacteria are associated with toxic blooms the ocean, and we know they cause toxicity to spike in the lab, but we don't know the mechanisms of toxin production," Sison-Mangus said.</p>
<p>One part of the new research project will focus on unraveling the details of how algae and bacteria interact to produce domoic acid. Another part of the project will use monitoring data from Monterey Bay to assess how this interaction fits into the larger context of the many physical and environmental factors, such as water temperature and nutrient levels, also known to influence toxic algae blooms.</p>
<p>Sorting out the effects of multiple factors, all varying simultaneously in a complex system, is a challenge. But this is Juhee Lee's area of expertise, and she has developed a Bayesian statistical modeling approach that will help the researchers understand how all these factors interact to influence the development of a toxic algae bloom.</p>

<p>Benner, a professor of environmental studies and sociology, studies economic growth and social justice.</p>
<p>He and his research partner Manuel Pastor (B.A., Merrill College, economics and literature, '78), a former faculty member at UC Santa Cruz who is now on the faculty at the University of Southern California, have led a decade-long research project focused on regional economic restructuring across the country. Their goal: to identify urban communities that have built their economies <em>and</em> bridged gaps in income, race, citizenship status, gender, education, and job training.</p>
<p>After reviewing data on nearly 200 U.S. cities, Benner and Pastor honed in on 11 regions that had tackled the challenges of growth, job stagnation, political and racial fragmentation, and educational and income disparities&#8212;and emerged with lessons to share with the rest of the country.</p>
<p>"At a moment when the nation is precariously divided, this work offers valuable lessons," said Benner. "Inequality is a pernicious and widespread problem, but people are joining forces and making progress."</p>
<p>Regional coalitions that have been successful in bridging equity and growth tend to be made up of people who hold different ideological perspectives, and who allow their decision making to be guided by data and information. "Yes, facts matter in these places," Benner said, smiling.</p>
<p>Participants typically include community activists, civic and business leaders, and elected officials, all of whom share a commitment to a common destiny and a long-term view of their region's future, he said.</p>
<p>Highlights from three regions that overcame obstacles:</p>
<p><strong>San Antonio</strong></p>
<p>The city overcame a persistent divide between activists and the business community that dated back to the 1970s and '80s. Advocates for low-income Chicano communities routinely squared off against business interests that controlled local government.</p>
<p>A switch to district elections changed the political landscape, and Mayor Henry Cisneros emerged as a bridge builder. In 1990, the closure of a Levi's factory cost 1,100 jobs; military downsizing followed. These jolts to the local economy spurred collaboration, with Ernie Cortes of Communities Organized for Public Service inspiring partnerships with community colleges and business leaders to build educational and job training programs. Project QUEST emerged as a national model for economic development.</p>
<p>"Today, the region is a model of collaborative leadership with a number of inspiring initiatives, particularly in long-range planning and early childhood education," said Benner.</p>
<p><strong>Salt Lake City</strong></p>
<p>Utah is undergoing a rapid demographic transformation, poised to become "majority minority" ahead of the rest of the country. Residents continue to welcome immigrants, perhaps a reflection of the Mormon emphasis on international programs that expose youth to other countries. The Mormon emphasis on a church-based social welfare system is evident across the state and Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>Programs and policies to benefit undocumented residents and the homeless are enacted with a "common sense" ease that escapes other regions: In 1999, the state began issuing drivers licenses to undocumented residents without controversy; Utah is also home to one of the country's most successful programs to address chronic homelessness. The "start with housing" approach opens the door to mental-health, substance-abuse, and job-training support, said Benner.</p>
<p>"The work of the nonprofit Envision Utah has also helped build a region-wide commitment to equitable and smart growth, and the region remains one of the most equitable in the country," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Oklahoma City</strong></p>
<p>Traditional economic development strategies failed Oklahoma City, which was unable to land a contract with United Airlines in the late 1980s despite offering a competitive package of economic incentives. According to lore, the wives of airline executives effectively scuttled the deal after they visited the city and found it lacking in "quality of life" measures.</p>
<p>Business leaders and the Republican mayor regrouped, shifting their focus to making Oklahoma City an appealing place to live. They advocated for a temporary sales-tax increase that took a "something for everyone" approach (projects included an opera house, a basketball arena, a convention hall, and a river redevelopment project) and won support from a broad range of conservative, generally anti-tax voters. After the projects came in on budget and essentially on time, voters approved two extensions of the tax.</p>
<p>"Yes, in conservative Oklahoma City, four Republican mayors in succession, a strongly conservative Chamber of Commerce, and a majority of voters approved increased taxes to address regional problems, as their commitment to place trumped their commitment to ideology," noted Benner.</p>
<p>"It's not like everything is perfect now, but these areas have shown that it's possible to come together, set common goals, do some heavy lifting, and make things better," said Benner. "That's such an important message today, when it's easy to feel discouraged by the national rhetoric of red versus blue, and worse."</p>
<p>These stories, and others around the country, offer valuable lessons for regions that want to chart their own paths and build a more vibrant, more equitable future, said Benner.</p>

<p>Led by Lise Getoor, professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering, the project will address the challenges of incompleteness, uncertainty, and bias in large, heterogeneous sets of interconnected data.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we talk about big data, the challenges are not just the scale of it, but also that all of the data are connected in some way, whether it&#8217;s social media data, or the Internet of Things, or protein interactions in biology. Data now are interconnected in all kinds of crazy, complex ways, and we need new computational and mathematical tools to help us make inferences and find patterns in the data,&#8221; Getoor said.</p>
<p>This type of interconnected data, where relationships or links between nodes define a network of interactions, is often referred to as heterogeneous graph data. Statistician Abel Rodriguez, professor of applied mathematics and statistics and a co-principal investigator on the grant, explained that incomplete data is particularly problematic in this context.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only see pieces of the whole network, and what makes this challenging is that it&#8217;s not random, we tend to miss certain things preferentially,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That type of bias is apparent in, for example, social media networks like Facebook or LinkedIn, where you don&#8217;t necessarily see all of my friends or connections. If I only respond to requests to connect but don&#8217;t initiate any, you&#8217;ll get a very biased version of my network. So how to identify and adjust for those biases is one component of this project.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Digital trails</strong></p>
<p>The digital trails people now leave behind in so many activities and interactions fit naturally into the network structure of graph data. The biases, uncertainty, and incompleteness in so much of this data raise issues of fairness when the data are used as the basis for decisions that affect people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to understand the bias in a more nuanced way so that we can talk about accuracy and fairness in the context of these rich, multimodal, heterogeneous datasets,&#8221; Getoor said. &#8220;We need to train people to understand and question the outputs of data science algorithms. I don&#8217;t think we even understand yet all the ways the algorithms can go wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the project, the researchers aim to develop a theoretical framework for "responsible data science" to address issues such as bias, fairness, privacy, and robustness. Rodriguez noted that uncertainty in the data can actually be exploited as a powerful tool for protecting privacy and preserving anonymity. The researchers will investigate techniques that involve adding random noise to data processing to preserve the privacy of individual nodes in a network.</p>
<p>In addition to Getoor and Rodriguez, the faculty involved in this collaborative project include computer scientists Seshadhri Comandur (a co-PI), Dimitris Achlioptas, and Abhradeep Guha Thakurta; statistician Rajarshi Guhaniyogi; and applied mathematician Daniele Venturi (also a co-PI). The team brings to the table a wide range of expertise and a diverse set of tools, including randomized algorithms, Bayesian statistics, and uncertainty quantification. A major goal of the collaboration is to bring together researchers from computer science, statistics, and mathematics, considered the fundamental disciplines of data science, to develop the field's theoretical foundations.</p>
<p>Getoor and Rodriguez also lead <a href="http://d3.ucsc.edu/">D3</a>, a data science research center that provides a platform for collaboration with industry partners. Synergistic interactions between D3 and the NSF project will help advance both programs, Getoor said. They are key components of a growing data science initiative across the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>The new grant is part of a major NSF program to develop the theoretical foundations of data science, called Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS). The UCSC project is called "TRIPODS: Towards a Unified Theory of Structure, Incompleteness, and Uncertainty in Heterogeneous Graphs." It is one of 12 awards NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=242888">announced</a> August 24 to support the development of small collaborative institutes in Phase I of the TRIPODS program.

<p><em>Sierra</em> magazine, the national magazine of the Sierra Club, today released its 11th annual &#8220;Cool Schools&#8221; ranking of America&#8217;s greenest colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Coming in at No.23, the ranking underscored UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s strong commitment to protecting the environment, addressing climate change, and encouraging sustainability. UCSC was the second highest-ranking UC campus, after UC Irvine (No. 8).</p>
<p>&#8220;The field is increasingly competitive with more universities participating in the ranking every year,&#8221; Director of Sustainability Elida Erickson said. &#8220;We continue to perform well, which strongly speaks to the innovative sustainability work happening across campus in academic innovation, social justice, greening science laboratories, and creating hands-on living laboratories.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 200 schools submitted information on their environmental practices in food and transportation systems, water and waste management, purchasing procedures, academics, investments, and more. UC Santa Cruz earned 662 points, with a perfect score in &#8220;Innovation.&#8221; In its report, the campus touted its Climate &amp; Energy Scenario Analysis Tool, and participation in the UC Office of the President&#8217;s Global Climate Leadership Council, which supports the university&#8217;s goal of reaching Carbon Neutrality by 2025.</p>
<p>The campus is in the midst of updating its five-year sustainability plan. The final plan is scheduled to be released this fall.</p>

That's what UC Santa Cruz biologists Daniel Costa and Luis Huckstadt were doing on a day off from studying Weddell seals when they realized that a pile of frozen pelts in one of the huts represented samples of Weddell seal tissue from more than 100 years ago, at the very start of human activities in Antarctica.</p>
<p>By using sophisticated isotope analysis to compare samples from modern and century-old seals, the researchers were able to investigate an urgent question about human impacts on the Antarctic ecosystem: Is the targeting of Antarctic toothfish by a small fishing fleet operating in the Ross Sea changing the structure of the ecosystem and altering the diets of Weddell seals?</p>
<p>"People have hypothesized that the toothfish are being depleted and that, as a consequence, the Weddell seal has shifted its diet to Antarctic silverfish," said Huckstadt, a postdoctoral researcher in Costa's lab at UC Santa Cruz. "We'd been talking about this issue and realized we had the samples right there to test it."</p>
<p>Their findings, published August 30 in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.0927"><em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>, indicate that the seals' diets probably have not changed much over the past hundred years. But the results did reveal evidence of significant change in the phytoplankton community, the microscopic marine algae at the base of the entire food web in the Ross Sea. They attributed this change to a climatic shift that began with the end of a global cooling period known as the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1500 to 1900.</p>
<p>With permission from the <a href="https://www.nzaht.org/">Antarctic Heritage Trust</a>, Huckstadt and Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, collected samples of fur from 34 pelts for comparison with samples from modern-day seals. To analyze them, they teamed up with two colleagues at UC Santa Cruz who are experts in isotope analysis: professor of ocean sciences Matthew McCarthy and professor of Earth and planetary sciences Paul Koch, both coauthors of the paper.</p>
<p>"I first visited the historic huts in 1978 on my first trip to the Antarctic," Costa said. "I was amazed that the huts were left in the same condition as the day the explorers left 100 years ago. I saw seal pelts, penguin carcasses, and remains of sled dogs literally frozen in time. I always wondered if there was something we could do with this material. These relatively new isotope analyses provided us a way of using those frozen artifacts as a snapshot of the past."</p>
<p>Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen are widely used as tracers of ecological processes. As top predators in the Antarctic ecosystem, Weddell seals incorporate into their tissues isotopic tracers that have passed up through the entire food chain, carrying evidence of the structure of the ecosystem and of the position or "trophic level" of the seals within the system.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the historical "isotopic niche" of Weddell seals (as indicated by the variability of the carbon and nitrogen isotopes) was over five times larger than the modern niche. This could reflect a more highly specialized diet in modern Weddell seals, but this seems unlikely given the diversity of their prey today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an analysis of nitrogen isotopes in specific amino acids showed that the trophic level of Weddell seals is unchanged, suggesting they are still eating the same kinds of fish as they did historically. Currently, Antarctic toothfish appears to make up less than 10 percent of the diet of Weddell seals, and the findings suggest this was also the case 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Changes in the sources of nitrogen and the composition of the phytoplankton community are more likely to account for the differences seen in the isotope data, Huckstadt said. "It looks more like a shift at the base of the food web, probably related to the transition from the Little Ice Age to current conditions, causing changes in the phytoplankton community," he said.</p>
<p>Although human activities are beginning to have impacts on the Ross Sea ecosystem, it remains relatively undamaged. This makes protecting the area and regulating human activities especially important, Huckstadt said. In 2016, after lengthy international negotiations, the Ross Sea was designated as the world's largest marine protected area by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.</p>
<p>"It's not quite pristine, but it's about as pure an ecosystem as you're going to find on this planet," Huckstadt said. "Hopefully we can keep it that way."</p>

<p>Researchers surveyed pika habitat throughout the north Lake Tahoe area and found that pikas had disappeared from an area that stretches from near Tahoe City to Truckee, more than ten miles away, and includes Mount Pluto. This local extinction is the largest area of pika extinction yet reported for the modern era.</p>
<p>&#8220;The loss of pikas from this large area of otherwise suitable habitat echoes prehistoric range collapses that happened when temperatures increased after the last ice age,&#8221; said lead author Joseph Stewart, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;This time, however, we&#8217;re seeing the effects of climate change unfold on a scale of decades as opposed to millennia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hikers and backpackers can still see pikas in the mountains surrounding the area of extinction. &#8220;Mount Rose and Desolation Wilderness are still great places to see pikas,&#8221; Stewart said. But not for long&#8212;the study forecasts that by 2050 climate change will cause a 97 percent decline in suitable climate conditions for pikas in the Lake Tahoe area.</p>
<p><strong>Haypiles</strong></p>
<p>Pikas, related to rabbits and hares, are about eight inches long with a stout body and round ears. They spend their summers carrying mouthfuls of grass and wildflowers from mountain meadows to &#8220;haypiles&#8221; tucked away in the rocky habitat they call home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The classic image of a pika is one hopping from rock to rock with a little &#8216;bouquet&#8217; of wildflowers in its mouth,&#8221; said coauthor David Wright, recently retired from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
<p>Pikas don&#8217;t hibernate, but rather use their furnace-like metabolism and thick coat of fur to stay warm during winters under the snow. &#8220;A larger haypile acts as insurance policy against winter starvation,&#8221; explained Stewart. &#8220;But the same adaptations that allow them to stay warm during winter make them vulnerable to overheating in the summer, and when summer temperatures are too hot, they can&#8217;t gather enough food to survive and reproduce.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pika search</strong></p>
<p>In order to confirm that pikas are now extinct from the 64-square-mile (165-square-kilometer) area, the authors searched for pikas over the course of six years, from 2011 to 2016, looking for evidence of pika activity and camping next to pika habitat to listen for the animal&#8217;s distinctive calls. &#8220;We found old pika fecal pellets buried in sediment in nearly every patch of habitat we searched,&#8221; said Stewart. &#8220;But the animals themselves were conspicuously absent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pika scat, which is small and round, can last a long time because the pika&#8217;s rocky habitat shelters it from sunlight and rain, Wright explained. &#8220;Their fecal pellets resemble peppercorns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s distinctive. It doesn&#8217;t resemble feces from any other species in the area.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study used radiocarbon dating to track the timeline of pika retreat from the area. &#8220;Above-ground nuclear arms testing, from before the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, resulted in an elevated concentration of radiocarbon in the atmosphere, and we used this signal to determine an age range for the relict pika scat,&#8221; explained study coauthor Katherine Heckman, a radiocarbon scientist with the U.S. Forest Service. Radiocarbon dating indicates that pikas likely disappeared from many of the lower elevation sites surrounding Mount Pluto before 1955, but persisted near the peak as recently as 1991.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pattern is exactly what we expect with climate change,&#8221; Stewart said. &#8220;As the hottest, lowest-elevation sites became too hot for pikas, they became restricted to just the mountain top, and then the mountain top became too hot as well.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Large gap</strong></p>
<p>The local pika extinction opens a large gap in the species distribution north of Lake Tahoe, and the authors believe this gap indicates the complete loss of population and genetic connectivity between pikas to the east and west.</p>
<p>The American pika is just one of many species threatened by a changing climate, Stewart said, listing salmon, wolverines, tigers, walruses, coral reefs, elephants, and redwood forests as other examples of iconic species vulnerable to climate change. A <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6234/571.full"><span>2015 meta-analysis published in <em>Science</em></span></a> found that about one in six species could be vulnerable to extinction from climate change this century.</p>
<p>The authors note that while management actions such as habitat protection, restoration, or assisted migration may be helpful for some climate-imperiled species, management options for the pika appear to be limited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hope is that simply getting the word out there that climate change is causing iconic wildlife to disappear will get people talking and contribute toward political will to reign in and reverse climate change,&#8221; Stewart said. &#8220;There&#8217;s still time to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We need our leaders to take bold action now.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/pika-study.html</url><title> Shrinking range of pikas in California mountains linked to climate change</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a9890fc807270176705df1ad5635419"><name>shennan-usda</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>USDA awards $2.5 million grant to UC Santa Cruz to expand organic strawberry research</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz researchers who have pioneered alternatives to methyl bromide in commercial strawberry production have received a $2.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that will take their work national.</summary><start-date>1503903600000</start-date><display-name>Shennan-USDA</display-name><path>/2017/08/shennan-usda</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/shennan-usda</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1503953193772</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1503954213587</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/strawberry_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/strawberry_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>strawberry_400.jpg</name><display-name>strawberry_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>51113</file-size><width>400</width><height>265</height></image><image-alt>Photo of strawberries</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/strawberry_thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/strawberry_thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>strawberry_thumb.jpg</name><display-name>strawberry_thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>4938</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of strawberries</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Carol Shennan and Joji Muramoto have developed a soil-preparation technique that's the best alternative to fumigants for controlling soil disease in commercial strawberry production.

<p>&#160;</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Research goes national as scientists tailor strategies to different regions around the country </article-subhead><article-text>UC Santa Cruz researchers who have pioneered alternatives to methyl bromide in commercial strawberry production have received a $2.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that will take their work national.<br/><br/>Carol Shennan, professor of environmental studies, will lead a team of researchers and stakeholders around the country who are optimizing biological methods to manage soil-borne diseases and pests. <br/><br/>The grant builds on Shennan's leadership in the development of alternatives to methyl bromide and other environmentally harmful soil fumigants used to combat soil pathogens. She and UC Santa Cruz research scientist Joji Muramoto have adapted a clever strategy called anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) for strawberries. ASD combines short-term saturation with the application of an organic amendment like rice bran under plastic mulch to temporarily create anaerobic conditions in the soil; that results in "fermentation" processes and changes the microbial activity in the soil prior to planting, killing off pathogens like <em>Verticillium dahliae</em> that can devastate berry fields. <br/><br/>Unlike methyl bromide, which dramatically reduces microbial activity in the soil, ASD shifts microbial populations in ways that suppress targeted pathogens. "It stimulates disease-suppressing mechanisms," explained Shennan. The technique has received significant interest in California, which produces more than 80 percent of the nation's strawberries; more than 20 percent of the state's organic strawberry acreage uses ASD to manage soil disease, said Shennan.<br/><br/>"Because it's a biological process, its effectiveness depends on the environmental conditions&#8212;soil type, soil temperature, carbon sources, pathogens, and water management," she said. "Heavier soils are more difficult because you don't want clods. Farmers also have to do this at the right time to get the soil temperatures needed to kill off pathogens, and they may need different carbon sources depending on which pathogens they have."<br/><br/>The goal of the USDA project is to develop region- and pathogen-specific management systems so farmers can use ASD in combination with crop rotation and disease-resistant strawberry varieties. This "integrated systems" approach is the best way to address environmental and biological variables and increase the reliability of pathogen control.<br/><br/>"ASD is not like a fumigant that's going to work wherever and whenever you apply it," said Shennan. "It's more knowledge-intensive. For strawberries, it's currently the best alternative to fumigants to control <em>Verticillium</em>."<br/><br/>Other barriers to the widespread adoption of ASD include the variability in soil types and the need for equipment to spread tons of rice bran, grape pumice, or other organic matter on fields. Shennan's team will survey farmers about their experiences with ASD to learn more about who uses it, what works, and what prompts growers to abandon the technique. "It's easier to do on some soil types than others," acknowledged Shennan. "And the mechanics take some working out." <br/><br/>"We've been doing this for 14 years now, getting an accumulation of data from greenhouse experiments and field trials," said Shennan. "This grant will allow us to analyze the data from all those trials, as well as new trials, in a comprehensive way so we can develop decision guidelines for farmers in each region."<br/><br/>Since the phase-out of methyl bromide, two diseases have emerged as significant challenges for strawberry growers on the Central Coast: fusarium wilt and charcoal rot, which are triggered by fungi that are well-adapted to local conditions. "Fusarium is difficult to control in the central coast of California with ASD alone because of the cold soil in the fall when it is typically done," said Shennan. Her team is now developing ASD strategies tailored to these additional pathogens, including summer ASD combined with more resistant cultivars.<br/><br/>Strawberries are a $2.8 billion industry in the United States, employing more than 80,000 workers. But the phase-out of methyl bromide and other fumigants has posed a significant challenge for berry growers around the country. Shennan's team will address the needs of growers in California, Florida, North Carolina, and Tennessee. <br/><br/>This project will focus on strawberries, but Shennan hopes to be able to apply what her team learns to get a "head start" on how to design systems for other crops. Like soil fumigation, ASD is a fairly expensive technique, which limits its use to specialty crops that fetch a higher price at the market. Researchers in Japan and the Netherlands are experimenting with ASD in greenhouse crops, asparagus, and tree seedling production, while scientists in Florida are conducting field trials with tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant.<br/><br/>A consortium of researchers, farmers, and other stakeholders has collaborated with Shennan to develop ASD strategies, which growers are now using on about 1,500 acres of strawberries and raspberries in California, according to Shennan. "That's up from one acre five years ago," she noted, adding, "None of this would have happened without our partnership with Farm Fuel in Watsonville, which delivered carbon sources and provided technical assistance to growers early on."<br/><br/>In addition to Muramoto, Shennan's collaborators include Mark Mazzola, a research plant pathologist with USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Wenatchee, WA; Oleg Daugovish, a farm adviser with UC's Cooperative Extension in Ventura County; and Erin Rosskopf, a research microbiologist with USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Florida.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2017/03/strawberry-fields-for-better/</url><title>Strawberry fields forever</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/11/organic-farming-research.html</url><title>Organic farming research</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2ed5b3ba807270176705df1a859f6ac4"><name>brycen-swart-salmon-run</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Giving fish a fighting chance</title><summary>Alumnus Brycen Swart identified how warmer river temperatures were hurting&#13;

Chinook salmon fry—and he earned a medal for conserving them</article-subhead><article-text><p>It was 2015 and the winter-run Chinook salmon on the Sacramento River were in trouble.</p>
<p>The drought that had already gripped the state for three years had caused the egg-to-fry survival rate for this evolutionarily significant fish to drop from an average of 25 percent to 4 percent that year.</p>
<p>Without some kind of intervention the winter-run salmon were on the verge of disappearing.</p>
<p>But thanks to efforts from a team of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists, including UC Santa Cruz alum Brycen Swart (Crown &#8217;02, environmental studies and economics), the fish were given a fighting chance.</p>
<p>Swart and the NOAA team not only found problems in the way the Bureau of Reclamation had calculated water-temperature projections that were critical to the fish&#8217;s survival but they also were able to negotiate changes for when and how much water was released from Shasta Dam into the Sacramento River where the fish spawn.</p>
<p>For that, Swart, 37, was among those given a 2017 Bronze Medal Award, the highest honor the U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere can give.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to think I am trying to speak for the salmon,&#8221; said Swart by telephone from his Sacramento office where he is a natural resources management specialist for NOAA and lead biologist for winter-run Chinook salmon. &#8220;Once they&#8217;re gone, they&#8217;re gone. There is no coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swart grew up in San Luis Obispo in a family that loved surfing, hiking, and camping so it was natural that he turned to marine biology when he came to UC Santa Cruz. An environmental studies class nudged him in a new direction, however, and a course in fisheries management taught by Marc Mangel sealed his future.</p>
<p>Swart got a summer internship with NOAA&#8217;s Southwest Fisheries Science Center office in Santa Cruz, which led to a job with the agency and also a master&#8217;s degree in Marine Resource Management from Oregon State University.</p>
<p>After a stint in Washington D.C., Swart arrived in NOAA&#8217;s Sacramento office just as California rolled into one of the worst droughts in its history and the winter-run Chinook salmon began their decline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having an unusual life history that allowed them (the winter-run salmon) to survive for thousands of years, it was hard to watch how man could wipe them out in a short amount of time,&#8221; Swart says.</p>
<p>There are four runs of Chinook salmon in the Central Valley of California but the winter-run salmon are the most endangered. These fish migrate up the Sacramento River from December to March then hang out for a while before they mature sexually. They spawn from May to August and then die. Meanwhile, the eggs hatch and the juveniles start their perilous 300-mile trek back to the ocean. After a year or two, the cycle starts over again with a return voyage up the Sacramento River. One of the most crucial elements for salmon survival, though, is cold water.</p>
<p>With the Shasta Dam blocking the fish&#8217;s historical routes to cold-water steams, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has to issue a plan in April or May for releasing water over the summer so farmers and residential users can get the water they need while also preserving the cold-water pool necessary for the survival of the winter-run salmon.</p>
<p>In the 2014 drought year, however, the Bureau&#8217;s calculations proved wrong and the 56-degree water that was supposed to keep the salmon alive through September ran out in August. Water temperatures climbed to 62 degrees. The juvenile salmon survival rate to Red Bluff that year dropped to 5 percent.&#160;</p>
<p>Swart, who was responsible for coordinating efforts of biologists across a number of agencies, was among those trying to figure out what went wrong. A team of NOAA scientists discovered the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation was using average historical summer air temperatures over an 82-year period for its water temperature forecasts. Those numbers didn't take into account the prolonged, record-high air temperatures that happened in 2014 and 2015. In addition, the limited amount of cold water in Shasta Reservoir made providing cold water very challenging.</p>
<p>According to Swart, the Southwest Fisheries Science Center was able to develop an updated temperature prediction model for the 2015 season based on newer technologies.</p>
<p>Two of those involved in the effort, and also receiving Bronze Awards, were fellow&#160;UC Santa Cruz alumni. Eric Danner&#160;(Ph.D. '06, ecology and evolutionary biology) currently leads the biophysical modeling team for NOAA that&#160;helped develop water temperature models for the spawning habitat, which were then linked to models of heat tolerance for salmon eggs. Rachel Johnson (Ph.D. '07, ecology and evolutionary biology)&#160;helped lead an effort to improve field data and monitoring to track the status of the fish through their life cycle.</p>
<p>But negotiating a water release plan was still a chess game.</p>
<p>Swart assembled data, did analysis, and made recommendations for weekly talks among those representing dam operators, agriculture and residential users, along with those overseeing fish and wildlife along the river.</p>
<p>Swart, says his supervisor, Water Operations and Delta Consultation Branch Chief Garwin Yip, &#8220;has a unique skill set&#8221; that allows him to take complicated problems and distill them in a ways so that others can understand issues and make decisions.</p>
<p>An agreement in 2015 that pushed the water temperature limit from 56 to 57 degrees that year, however, resulted in another bad spell for the young salmon.</p>
<p>In 2016, &#8220;we were fortunate to receive enough precipitation to almost fill Shasta Reservoir, and employed new management tools based off our lessons learned,&#8221; Swart says.</p>
<p>Those tools included lowering water temperature compliance to 53 degrees, using conservative meteorological forecasts and setting up restoration projects in the upper Sacramento River; like the creation of side channels and the addition of gravel to increase the quantity and quality of spawning habitat for adult fish, along with the installation of woody debris and boulders to help juvenile fish avoid predators before they headed out to the sea.</p>
<p>NOAA also developed a five-year recovery plan for winter-run Chinook salmon titled <em>Species in the Spotlight</em>, which includes proposals to reintroduce the fish to former spawning grounds on the Battle Creek and McCloud rivers.</p>
<p>While winter-run salmon survival rates improved in 2016, the outlook for the fish is still grim.</p>
<p>For Swart, the story of the decline of the winter-run Chinook salmon isn't just a tale of one fish but of an entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the whole experience shows that, with climate change, we have to change the way we manage and deal with water in California because it is such a scarce resource.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t keep doing business as usual,&#8221; he says.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2f76fcc2807270176705df1aca24ad1d"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Parking Management Starts September 1st at the Coastal Science Campus and 2300 Delaware</title><summary>Beginning September 1, 2017, UCSC parking permits will be required on the Coastal Science Campus (and at 2300 Delaware Avenue) weekdays from 8:00am–5:00pm, except holidays.</summary><start-date>1503990000000</start-date><display-name>parking-coastal-sciences</display-name><path>/2017/08/news-article</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/news-article</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1504034879314</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1504034879314</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Beginning&#160;September 1, 2017, UCSC parking permits will be required on the Coastal Science Campus (and at 2300 Delaware Avenue) weekdays from 8:00am&#8211;5:00pm,&#160;except holidays.

<p>Led by Hudson Pinheiro, who began work on the project as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and is now a postdoctoral ichthyologist at the California Academy of Sciences, the researchers have proposed a new conceptual model of island biogeography for marine organisms. The theory explores how different processes, like sea level fluctuations and geographic isolation, influence marine species diversity around islands.</p>
<p>The team found that, despite some similarities, the forces that tend to shape diversification and community assemblage on land are different from those that impact marine life around islands and seamounts. The researchers from UC Santa Cruz, California Academy of Sciences, and Universidade Federal do Esp&#237;rito Santo published their findings August 30 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature23680.html">Nature</a>.</p>
<p>A key difference between the marine and terrestrial realms is that many marine species disperse better than land-based animals, arriving quickly around inhabitable islands to fill available ocean niches. This fast action by skilled dispersers leaves no chance for species to fill new niches through adaptation and evolution, as is typically seen over time on terrestrial island habitats.</p>
<p>"Organisms disperse so well in marine systems because their larvae are moved by ocean currents over great distances. In terrestrial systems, dispersal to islands is much more limited," said coauthor Giacomo Bernardi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Pinheiro has spent years conducting surveys and studying the genetics of reef fish in the Vit&#243;ria-Trindade Chain of seamounts and islands in the south Atlantic Ocean. &#8220;In order to crack the forces that shape ocean life around islands, we decided to dig into the evolutionary history of Brazilian reef fishes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When we focused on 10 species in a chain of volcanic seamounts and islands off the coast of Brazil, we saw that older endemic species were larger. These large fishes were better dispersers than their &#8216;younger&#8217; species counterparts, which were all small, bad dispersers. It&#8217;s clear that these unique marine environments need their own model to explain what lives where over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using DNA analysis to trace the evolutionary history of the reef fishes restricted to this specific chain of seamounts and islands, the scientists were able to better understand exactly how island geography, geological history, and sea level fluctuations generally impact the diversity of nearby marine species. Fish were collected from both shallow and deep reef locations. Pinheiro and his colleagues used specialized equipment called rebreathers for dives to depths of 200 to 500 feet beneath the ocean&#8217;s surface.</p>
<p>Their findings confirm that sea level changes and the locations of exposed seamounts play a critical role in marine evolution over time, mainly by intermittently providing stepping-stones for weak disperser species to colonize island habitats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re finally understanding how the complex, ever-changing web of island life on land differs from the same web in the ocean,&#8221; said senior author Luiz Rocha, Academy curator of ichthyology. &#8220;Think of iconic Gal&#225;pagos finches&#8212;when their ancestor arrived in the region, there were many empty land niches to fill and adaptations emerged to help them specialize over time. It&#8217;s simply not the same in island marine habitats. Fast-dispersing marine organisms quickly colonize available niches, and we don&#8217;t see the same pattern of specialized adaptation over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biologists Robert H. MacArthur and E.O. Wilson pioneered the field of island biogeography in the 1960s as a way to explain the distribution of species around the world&#8212;how they move, change, and occasionally go extinct. Their seminal book on the subject was published in 1967. Islands isolated by water could be viewed as splintered habitats with higher extinction rates than their larger, continuous counterparts like continents and their coastlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research team had quite an exciting brainstorming session about testing a marine biogeography theory,&#8221; Bernardi said. &#8220;We knew that MacArthur and Wilson came up with parts of their theory by drawing on restaurant napkins. We were drawing our hypotheses on paper towels in a lab. This type of scientific collaboration is exciting, and the foundational work of innovative predecessors helps make it happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Understanding the forces that help shape what allows species to persist in (and adapt to) different environments over time is a useful tool in tailoring conservation work and modeling for the future. This field of research has prompted new generations of scientists&#8212;including the authors of the <em>Nature</em> paper&#8212;to push for a more detailed understanding of evolution during our modern time of mass species extinction and rapidly changing climate.</p>
<p>Terrestrial and marine environments are both vulnerable to the never-before-seen wave of species die-off&#8212;called the &#8220;sixth mass extinction&#8221;&#8212;currently underway. The global community risks losing valuable marine ecosystems like coral reefs&#8212;systems that support the livelihoods and well-being of billions of people worldwide&#8212;to the combined impacts of overfishing, habitat destruction, water pollution, climate change, and ocean acidification. At least a quarter of the world&#8217;s reefs have already been lost, with another 30 percent predicted to die in the next thirty years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have hope,&#8221; Pinheiro said. &#8220;The more we uncover about dynamic marine environments and how they change over time, the better we can plan to protect them from future threats. This study sheds light on the ebb and flow of marine life on islands over evolutionary time. My role as a scientist is to chase the light, and encourage others to do the same.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="34e130bc807270176705df1ae20d522d"><name>coastal-wetlands</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Coastal wetlands dramatically reduce property losses during hurricanes</title><summary>A new scientific study reports that coastal wetlands significantly reduce annual flood losses and catastrophic damages from storms.</summary><keywords>Siddharth Narayan, Michael Beck, Mike Beck, flood loss, NFIP</keywords><start-date>1504184400000</start-date><display-name>Coastal wetlands dramatically reduce property losses during hurricanes</display-name><path>/2017/08/coastal-wetlands</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/08/coastal-wetlands</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1504125725654</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1506379560709</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/flooding-nj-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/flooding-nj-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>flooding-nj-400.jpg</name><display-name>flooding-nj-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>98346</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>coastal flooding</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/urban-marsh-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/urban-marsh-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>urban-marsh-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>urban-marsh-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25403</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>urban salt marsh</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Flooding in New Jersey caused by Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in New Jersey and devastated the East Coast.

Led by a team of scientists from the engineering, insurance, and conservation sectors, including researchers at UC Santa Cruz, the study found that coastal wetlands in the northeast United States prevented $625 million in direct flood damages during Hurricane Sandy, reducing damages by more than 22 percent in half of the affected areas and by as much as 30 percent in some states.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/s41598-017-09269-z">published August 31 in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>, quantified the flood reduction benefits provided by coastal wetlands across the northeastern United States during Hurricane Sandy, as well as the benefits provided annually in Barnegat Bay in Ocean County, New Jersey. It used the risk industry&#8217;s latest and most rigorous high-resolution flood and loss models and an extensive database of property exposure to show the correlations between property value and wetland presence, and between wetland extent and avoided flood damages.</p>
<p>The vast majority of public and private funding for coastal infrastructure goes toward built structures (e.g., concrete), with only about 3 percent going to restoration of natural infrastructure (e.g., wetlands), according to a <a href="http://cbe.miis.edu/joce/vol3/iss2/6/">recent analysis</a> by UC Santa Cruz researchers. The authors of the new study said their findings make a clear case for reallocation of this coastal investment portfolio, particularly after disasters such as Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wetlands can be incredibly effective at reducing property damages from catastrophic storms, and these effects can be clearly understood by combining state-of-art engineering models with coastal ecology and economic analysis,&#8221; said lead author Siddharth Narayan, a coastal engineer at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Coastal habitats provide benefits that represent hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings along the U.S. East Coast.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Clear correlation</strong></p>
<p>The study showed a clear correlation between wetland cover and avoided property damages: the greater the extent of the wetland, the more protection it provides. Even relatively degraded wetlands in highly urban areas like New York City provided hundreds of millions of dollars in flood protection during Hurricane Sandy, preventing $140 million in flood damages in New York and $425 million in New Jersey.</p>
<p>In addition, the study demonstrated that coastal wetlands provide important coastal protection services year-round. Annual flood losses in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, were 16 percent lower in places that had conserved their marshes than where the marshes were gone. In places that were 1.5 meters or less above sea level, the relative annual risk reduction benefits from wetlands were as high as 70 percent.</p>
<p>The study was led by UC Santa Cruz, The Nature Conservancy, and the Wildlife Conservation Society in association with Risk Management Solutions and Guy Carpenter &amp; Company, with funding from Lloyd&#8217;s Tercentenary Research Foundation. This partnership between the conservation, engineering, insurance, and risk management sectors was born out of the realization that coastal development and climate change will continue to increase the risks to people and property from flooding and storm surge, and that protecting coastal habitats can mitigate some of these risks. Coastal habitats are natural defenses that can help reduce risk in a cost-effective way, adapting to changes in the environment and providing multiple benefits to society.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Conservation and restoration</strong></p>
<p>In a connected <a href="http://www.lloyds.com/coastalresilience">report from Lloyd&#8217;s</a>, the partners identified how the findings in the <em>Scientific Reports</em> paper can be used to fund wetland conservation and restoration. Before a disaster strikes, investments in habitat conservation that reduce coastal risk could reduce premiums on insurance and insurance-linked securities (such as resilience bonds). In this way, habitat restoration could pay for itself in savings. After a disaster strikes, private insurance and public recovery funds can support wetland conservation, with the benefits of further reducing insurance premiums and building coastal resilience against future disasters. The risk and insurance industry can play a critical role in wetland restoration for disaster prevention and recovery.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the benefits was surprising given how many coastal wetlands already have been lost throughout the region. For example, wetlands did not reduce as much damage in New York in part because of their extensive loss in past decades. At the same time, even relatively small, thin bands of wetlands serve as an effective first line of defense, and they can be restored to build coastal resilience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our models traditionally focus on man-made coastal defense structures, or on other gray architecture solutions, like elevating properties above sea level,&#8221; said coauthor Paul Wilson, vice president of model development at RMS and an expert in hurricane and storm surge. &#8220;This study is pioneering because it applies cutting-edge modeling science to natural defenses, and it allows us to put a financial value on the role wetlands play in protecting our coastal communities against storm surges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quantifying the economic value of natural defenses will increase their relevance and inclusion in coastal management priorities. Although the risk-reduction role of coastal wetlands is often included in risk models, it is not clearly recognized by risk modelers, insurers, brokers, and clients. The risk-reduction role of wetlands can be straightforwardly included in the products of the risk and engineering sectors, and thus more readily considered in coastal development and habitat restoration decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although these might be strange bedfellows, engineers, insurers, and conservationists can come together to save people, property, and nature,&#8221; said coauthor and project lead Michael Beck, lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy and a research associate at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Our work together shows where we can find innovative solutions for reducing flood risk and conserving wetlands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lloyd&#8217;s Tercentenary Research Foundation aims to fund cutting-edge scientific research that contributes positively to society; this principle is embodied in the ongoing project led by the University of California at Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Jean-Bernard Crozet, trustee of Lloyd&#8217;s Tercentenary Research Foundation and head of underwriting modeling at MS Amlin. &#8220;Coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangroves, and salt marshes play a fundamental role in reducing the risk of storm surge. The LTRF believes that improved quantification of these benefits will, in turn, lead to better management and conservation of these natural ecosystems, contributing not only to risk reduction along our coasts but to our planet&#8217;s sustainability in the long run.&#8221;</p>

<p>UC STATEMENT ON TROPICAL STORM HARVEY</p>
<p>On behalf of our faculty, staff and students, the University of California would like to express profound sympathy and concern to our colleagues in the higher education community in Houston and surrounding areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey. The challenges of catastrophic flooding and devastation will no doubt mount as the communities, colleges and universities navigate the uncertainty and challenges of embarking on a new school year. UC pledges its support and assistance to those in need, as the work to provide relief, unite and rebuild the community begins in the coming days.</p>
<p>In the last few days, members of the UC community have reached out to colleagues in higher education in the Houston area to offer assistance and support.&#160; We are presently working with the more than 100 students entering our university in the fall, who may need early accommodations as a result of being displaced by the effects of Tropical Storm Harvey. The Office of the President is coordinating this effort on behalf of the 10 campus system.</p>
<p>In addition we are mobilizing UC research and faculty resources to assist in the aftermath of the hurricane and stand ready to assist with health care and emergency response resources.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a pleasure to share with you that the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz has come to a close&#8212;and on a sky-high note! Together we raised </span><strong>more than $335 million</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of our students, faculty, and programs. Congratulations to all who helped make this campaign such a striking success.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when we launched the campaign&#8212;the quiet phase in 2009 and the public phase in 2013&#8212;we were in uncharted territory. UC Santa Cruz had never attempted a comprehensive fundraising campaign. Now, in addition to exceeding our goal of $300 million, we have established a culture of philanthropy among our students and alumni, our faculty and staff, and our friends and supporters. This is crucial for future efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many impacts of the campaign:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding 16 new faculty chairs </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launching new coastal science and policy programs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanding our ground-breaking genomics research</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adding stunning archives that offer insight into California&#8217;s&#8212;and the nation&#8217;s&#8212;arts and cultural scenes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renovating our historic Hay Barn and Quarry Amphitheater</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naming Rachel Carson College, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and providing an endowment to provide students with educational opportunities in ecology and environmental justice in perpetuity</span></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming months, we will be sharing these stories and many others, all detailing the impact of the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall we will take time during Founders Weekend to celebrate our donors and the good created by their philanthropy. The weekend will include a special convocation to recognize all of our chair holders.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this campaign is ending, our push to increase philanthropic support for the campus is ongoing. Our great work here demands that our efforts continue.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you all for your commitment, and again, congratulations! </span></p>
<br/>
