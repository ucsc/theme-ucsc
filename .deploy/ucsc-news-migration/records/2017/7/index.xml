(Image credit: SDSS Collaboration)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A primitive galaxy that could provide clues about the early universe has been spotted by astronomers as it begins to be consumed by a gigantic neighboring galaxy.</p>
<p>The Little Cub galaxy--so called because it sits in the Ursa Major or Great Bear constellation--is being stripped of the gas needed to continue forming stars by its larger companion. The find means scientists now have a rare opportunity to observe a dwarf galaxy as its gas is removed by the effects of a nearby giant galaxy to learn more about how this process happens.</p>
<p>As the Little Cub has remained almost pristine since its formation, scientists also hope its elements will reveal more about the chemical signature of the universe just minutes after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>The research, carried out by UC Santa Cruz and Durham University, UK, is being presented on Tuesday, July 4, at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting.</p>
<p>The Little Cub and its larger neighbor, a spiral galaxy called NGC 3359, are about 200 to 300 thousand light years apart, and approximately 50 million light years from Earth. Gas from the Little Cub is being stripped away by its interaction with NGC 3359, which has up to 10,000 times as many stars as the Little Cub and is similar to our Milky Way. By observing this cosmic feast, scientists hope to understand more about how and when gas is lost from smaller galaxies.</p>
<p>"We may be witnessing the quenching of a near-pristine galaxy as it makes its first passage about a Milky Way-like galaxy," said lead author Tiffany Hsyu, a graduate student in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "It is rare for such a tiny galaxy to still contain gas and be forming stars when it is in close proximity to a much larger galaxy so this is a great opportunity to see just how this process works. Essentially the larger galaxy is removing the fuel that the Little Cub needs to form stars, which will eventually shut down star formation and lead to the smaller galaxy's demise."</p>
<p>The researchers also hope to gain an insight into the make-up of the very early universe by studying the hydrogen and helium atoms that are being illuminated by the small number of very bright stars within the Little Cub (which also has the less romantic name SDSS J1044+6306). Since this galaxy is so primitive, it may still preserve the hydrogen and helium atoms that were created minutes after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Research coauthor Ryan Cooke, Royal Society University Research Fellow in Durham University's Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy, said, "We know by studying the chemistry of the Little Cub that it is one of the most primitive objects currently known in our cosmic neighborhood. Such galaxies, which have remained dormant for most of their lives, are believed to contain the chemical elements forged a few minutes after the Big Bang. By measuring the relative number of hydrogen and helium atoms in the Little Cub we might be able to learn more about what made up the Universe in the moments after it began 13.7 billion years ago."</p>
<p>The researchers hope further observations will find more pristine galaxies where the chemical signature of the early universe might be found.</p>
<p>The Little Cub was initially identified as a potentially pristine dwarf galaxy in data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Follow-up observations were conducted using the 3-meter Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory and the 10-meter Keck II telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory.</p>
<p>"The Little Cub's discovery is a terrific example of using the smaller 3-meter-class Lick Observatory to scan through hundreds of candidates before focusing on the best sources with UC's 10-meter Keck telescope," said coauthor J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A paper describing the discovery of Little Cub has been submitted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>
<p>The research was funded by the W.M. Keck Foundation, Google, The Royal Society, NASA, the Science and Technology Facilities Council, and the National Science Foundation (USA). The Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting takes place at the University of Hull, UK, through Thursday, July 6, 2017.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="18cad1aa807270177c20a64788b3737a"><name>fall-admissions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus admits record number of California transfers</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz offered admission to 27,216 students for the upcoming academic year with a record number of offers made to California community college students.

<p>With the largest applicant pool in campus history and a smaller enrollment target than the previous year, the campus increased its admission selectivity, based on preliminary numbers released today (July 6) by the UC Office of the President. This year&#8217;s admitted freshmen had an average GPA of 3.89, average SAT scores of 1819 (old), 1277 (new), and an average ACT of 28.</p>
<p>The largest portion of admissions offers&#8212;19,258 or 70 percent&#8212;are to California students. Total freshmen admission offers declined by 5 percent, a reflection of an exceptionally large entering class for fall 2016 and smaller enrollment targets for fall 2017. The admission rate for California community college transfer students rose by 13.6 percent, the highest one-year increase of any of the UC campuses.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is fully committed to enrolling one California resident transfer for every two California resident freshmen as soon as possible, said Chancellor George Blumenthal. The campus expects to enroll 19 percent more California transfers compared to fall 2013 when it began to screen for major preparation requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are committed to balancing student success and access,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;We are accepting winter transfer applications as well and will continue to be open for winter until this goal is achieved. This summer, I am meeting with several of our Regents, state leaders, and regional community college presidents as we continue to enhance and expand our recruitment and enrollment efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus this fall anticipates welcoming about 4,500 new California undergraduates, who have selected the campus for its exceptional focus on social justice, reputation for high-impact research conducted by faculty, student resource centers, and opportunities to work with faculty on research projects and performances.</p>
<p>The campus expects to enroll approximately 3,960 new freshmen. The vast majority&#8212;roughly 3,400 (86 percent)&#8212;hail from California with approximately 560 (14 percent) coming from other states or countries.</p>
<p>The campus significantly increased the number of offers (fall and winter quarters) to California community college students, offering a spot to 6,152 students, a 13 percent increase from last year and a 31 percent increase from 2015.</p>
<p>"The transfer student admit numbers are particularly gratifying given all the work we're doing with community colleges throughout the state. We are seeing more and more well-qualified transfer students applying to our campus and our admit figures reflect just that," said Director of Admissions Michael McCawley. &#8220;I'm particularly pleased that we were able to admit at least one student from 113 of the 114 community colleges, underscoring our commitment to serve all the community colleges in California."</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are preparing to welcome the new class into UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s distinctive residential colleges, Summer Academies, Scholars Program, and new federally funded programs related to the campus&#8217;s Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) status, and ever-expanding opportunities for undergraduate research, internships, and creative projects with world-class faculty.</p>
<p>Compared to last year, the campus expects to enroll approximately 300 more California undergraduate full-time equivalents (FTE) during the regular 2017-18 academic year and summer. However, because of the very large freshmen class last year that will be continuing this year, and despite record applications, the campus will bring in roughly 425 fewer new California undergraduates than a year ago.</p>
<p>Campus diversity remains strong with the percentage of admitted African American, American Indian, Asian American, and Chicano/Latino student remaining steady.</p>
<p>The campus admitted 824 California African American students, accounting for 4.3 percent of all California admits and up from 3.7 percent last year. The campus remains committed to reaching a critical mass of African American undergraduates in order to create a more inclusive environment. The near-term goal is to increase from the current 4 percent of overall undergraduate enrollments to 5 percent. Students, staff, faculty, and alumni continue to collaborate on ways to enhance the campus climate.</p>
<p>Recruiting students from other countries and states is also part of the campus commitment to creating an inclusive campus, as all perspectives contribute to a dynamic social and cultural atmosphere on campus. The campus offered admission to 3,082 out-of-state students and 4,876 international freshmen. The campus anticipates having about 600 new freshman and transfer international and out-of-state undergraduates enroll this fall.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="192af802807270177c20a6472cda8a3c"><name>whistleblower-protection</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California Whistleblower Protection Act - Annual Notice</title><summary>The University of California is committed to maintaining the highest standards of conduct in the fulfillment of its education, research, public service and patient care mission.

The University&#8217;s Whistleblower Policy provides multiple avenues for employees to bring forward concerns of potential employee misconduct. Faculty and staff are encouraged to bring forward concerns about possible improper governmental activity directly to their supervisor, department head, Locally Designated Official (LDO) or other appropriate university offices or officials.&#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 The University established a systemwide independently-operated whistleblower hotline to allow for calls or web-based reporting from faculty, staff and students with a provision for anonymous reporting. The hotline relays the reported concerns to appropriate university officials for processing. This hotline is staffed seven days a week, 24 hours per day and is capable of receiving reports in a number of different languages.<br/>
 <br/>
 The toll-free number is <a href="tel:800%20403-4744">1-800-403-4744</a>. &#160;Web-based reports can be made by accessing <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline">http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline</a>. More information about the whistleblower process can be found on the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/uc-whistleblower/index.html">UC Whistleblower website</a> and on posters displayed in various employee areas. The University&#8217;s whistleblower poster identifies other channels for reporting improper governmental activity, including the California State Auditor, the California Attorney General and locations for reporting fraud and abuse involving federal programs.&#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 The California Government Code requires every state agency, including the University of California, to annually distribute to its employees a message from the California State Auditor that provides an explanation of the California Whistleblower Protection Act.

<span>&#160;<br/>
</span><span>As you know, students in May approved a referendum that will provide much-needed funding for our NCAA Division III athletics program. Had it not passed, I would have faced a truly difficult decision: whether to continue to fund intercollegiate athletics on campus.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>But even before securing that funding, we had decided to take a deeper look at our intercollegiate program in hopes of creating something more sustainable. To that end, we are now modeling our program on successful Division III programs nationwide.&#160;</span><br/>
<span>&#160;</span><br/>
<span>A significant change is that our head coaches will now have three-year, full-time contracts. This is good news that I believe will contribute to the long-term health and stability of our athletics program.&#160;</span><br/>
<span>&#160;</span><br/>
<span>The campus has offered new contracts to nine of our 11 head coaches for NCAA teams. The old ones expired June 30. The new contracts include full benefits and a 3 percent salary increase. The contracts started July 1.&#160;</span><br/>
<span>&#160;</span><br/>
<span>For coaches who held other non-coaching duties, the contracts were for coaching only, with non-coaching responsibilities moved elsewhere in the unit.</span><br/>
<span>&#160;</span><br/>
<span>Eight of the nine coaches signed the offers. The ninth chose to retire.</span><br/>
<span>&#160;</span><br/>
<span>There are changes for assistant coaches, too. They will now have six-month contracts. Previously, contracts were for 12 months, with required three-month furloughs. Contracts for the assistants also expired June 30. All assistants have been encouraged to apply when the new positions are posted in an open recruitment.</span><br/>

Where are the people of color in the food movement?'"</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Middle age has a way of sneaking up on people and programs, so hearing now that the experiment in organic gardening that began at UC Santa Cruz in 1967 is the oldest university-based organic research and education facility in the country is, well, unexpected.<br/><br/>"It's the people's farm," says Daniel Press, professor of environmental studies and executive director of the internationally acclaimed, hands-on learning and research programs housed at UC Santa Cruz. "What began as a student- and faculty-initiated idea to create a garden as a place for repose, renewal, and connection is, today, an incredibly well-rounded resource that exists to serve and inspire people."<br/><br/>More than 1,500 apprentices have learned the art and practice of organic farming and gardening at UC Santa Cruz, making them the "signature crop."<br/><br/>"If you meet an organic farmer in California, we probably trained them or someone who trained them," says Press, only half in jest.<br/><br/>Farmers aren't the only crop produced by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. The Center is home to a range of programs that have upended just about every aspect of food production.<br/><br/>"Universities are incubators of new ideas, and the Center has brought together the science and social aspects of food production in a way that is changing the landscape and the body politic," says Press, who would like to retire the Center's unwieldy name in favor of something more lyrical.<br/><br/>Recently retired Congressman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) was an early and passionate fan of the campus's agroecology programs, and his advocacy in Washington, D.C., brought in much-needed federal support during his 22 years in the capital. <br/><br/>"The modern-day food movement really began at UC Santa Cruz, where a small band of visionaries embraced organic agriculture and did things that conventional growers said couldn't be done," says Farr. "Those pioneers went back to basics, learning how to nourish the land and grow crops without harmful chemical inputs."<br/><br/>Those visionaries started a revolution that is stronger than ever 50 years later, adds Farr: "They're still the visionaries, pushing for safe working conditions and fair wages for farm workers, training farmers, promoting community-supported agriculture, and always as guardians of the public interest and our precious natural resources."<br/><br/><strong>Roots of success</strong><br/><br/>It all began 50 years ago when faculty and students appealed to Chancellor Dean McHenry, proposing a garden project that would serve as a central gathering spot on the remote, forested campus. As legend has it, Alan Chadwick, a charismatic, somewhat cantankerous master gardener from England, chose a steep, rocky, sun-scorched slope covered with poison oak to prove a point: If students could create a garden there, they could create one anywhere. And create they did. <br/><br/>With no chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or herbicides, Chadwick and his crew used only natural fertility, hand tools, and love to create a lush 4-acre plot that soon overflowed with vibrant vegetables and fragrant flowers. Chadwick introduced the French intensive, raised-bed method of gardening that features double digging, compost-enriched soil, dense plantings, and diverse crops. Today, the garden's beds produce tender, melt-in-your-mouth lettuces, succulent basils, a rainbow of peppers, a cacophony of blossoms&#8212;all framed by redwoods, citrus trees, and more than 120 varieties of heirloom apples and pears.</p>
<p>Just up the road from Chadwick's merry troupe, Alice Waters, the owner of Berkeley's famed Chez Panisse restaurant, was planting the seeds of a flavor revolution by creating an appetite&#8212;and demand&#8212;for fresh, organic, locally grown fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>"Chez Panisse and the Center are kindred spirits, changing the world by changing the way we eat, the way we grow food, and the way we teach our children about the land," says Waters.</p>
<p>On campus, the garden became a "laboratory"&#8212;a hub of teaching and hands-on learning that became a model for all that followed.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz has been at the forefront of the food movement for decades, preparing farmers, teachers, cooks, community activists, and policymakers to help us build a healthy, sustainable food system," says Waters, whose own mission has also broadened; she founded The Edible Schoolyard in 1995 to bring a hands-on, garden-based "edible education curriculum" to children from kindergarten through high school.</p>
<p><strong>A farm is born</strong></p>
<p>The campus rapidly outgrew the garden as students, faculty, and researchers joined the burgeoning "alternative food movement." In 1971, the garden program branched out onto an additional 17-acre plot down the hill. The formal six-month, residential Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture was born, a certificate program offered through UC Extension, and the new acreage meant the program could expand to include tractor-based farming for the first time. <br/><br/>"The UCSC Apprenticeship Program is the original innovator of farmer education in sustainable agriculture," says Kathleen Merrigan, former deputy secretary and chief operating officer of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and now the executive director of sustainability at George Washington University. "Its graduates are everywhere in the field of sustainable food systems."<br/><br/>The program grew, and graduates of the apprenticeship fanned out to start their own organic farms and gardens. Word spread, and applications poured in from across the country&#8212;as well as Canada, Africa, Mexico, and South America. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the increased acreage also accommodated scientific research trials. Center researchers partnered with local farmers to pioneer ways to grow crops like apples, artichokes, and strawberries without hazardous fumigants, pesticides, and weed killers. Interest continued, and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems was established, formalizing the nation&#8217;s first university-based program in agroecology, a scientific approach that emphasizes the ecology of farming systems.<br/><br/><strong>Launching a movement</strong><br/><br/>Training farmers and "greening" food production wasn't enough, though. As part of its commitment to enhancing the viability of small farms, the Center nurtured the "community supported agriculture" model in which members "invest" in the farm upfront, giving growers a guaranteed income at the start of each season. Staff share their expertise by writing organic crop-production training manuals on key crops--and distributing them free online. And they worked to broaden agricultural policy to include issues of social justice and worker welfare, bringing wages, working conditions, and the tragedy of farmworkers who go hungry into the conversation.<br/><br/>"The central coast of California is the capital of organic agriculture in large part because of UC Santa Cruz," says Press. "This university championed organic farming before anyone else, training farmers and raising public awareness about the environmental significance of growing food without synthetic chemicals. Today, the Center is broadening the definition of sustainability to encompass the well being of people as well as the environment. We need its leadership now more than ever."<br/><br/>Although undergraduates launched the garden program, over the years a relatively small portion of students tapped the Center's educational opportunities, although some took advantage of internships, independent study programs, and field study. With Press's arrival as executive director in 2012, the Center began strengthening ties with the campus's academic programs. Today, hundreds of students partake of the smorgasbord of experiential learning opportunities, including classes with labs at the Farm and Chadwick Garden. Students can choose a concentration in agroecology and sustainable food systems offered by the Environmental Studies Department, and Press would like one day to offer a major in agroecology.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz is not a land-grant campus, so it's not one of UC's "ag schools," but that hasn't kept the Farm from becoming a busy research site that channels millions of federal dollars into efforts to improve crop production, soil health, and the sustainability of food systems.<br/><br/>"The big ag schools solve problems for the agriculture industry in their region," says Press. "Our niche is to solve the problems of organic production. Thirty percent of agriculture in Santa Cruz County is certified organic." Nationally, demand for organic food climbs steadily; in 2015, nearly 13,000 certified organic farms produced $6.2 billion in commodities, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. California leads the way with $2.4 billion in sales&#8212;40 percent of total U.S. certified organic sales. <br/><br/>Among the signature achievements of the Center's research program is the development of strategies to produce strawberries without harmful soil fumigants like methyl bromide. In the early 1990s, faced with the phase-out of methyl bromide, conventional growers literally said it couldn't be done&#8212;and then Center researcher Sean Swezey and Environmental Studies Professor Steve Gliessman did it, collaborating with Jim Cochran of Swanton Berry Farm. That breakthrough led to more research by Environmental Studies Professor Carol Shennan and research scientist Joji Muramoto. Their approach focuses on anaerobic soil disinfestation, a clever strategy that uses short-term field flooding and organic matter to create a temporary environment that kills off harmful soil pathogens prior to planting.<br/><br/>The Center's leadership is evident across the UC system, where CASFS representatives, led by food systems researcher Tim Galarneau (Rachel Carson College '05, psychology), spearheaded UC&#8217;s systemwide adoption of 20 percent "real food" purchases, driving the university's commitment to buy food that is produced in a fair, humane, and environmentally sustainable manner. UC Santa Cruz is committed to purchasing 40 percent "real food" for its dining halls and other food facilities by 2020.<br/><br/>The Center's reach extends to K-12 partners, as well. Affiliates are working to improve K-12 school nutrition programs through partnerships with 15 school districts in Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz counties. The Farm is also home to Life Lab, the oldest garden-based K-12 education program in the country; Life Lab brings more than 2,000 students to the Farm every year. And Food What?! is a Farm-based youth-empowerment program that uses farming, gardening, and cooking to build life and career skills.<br/><br/><strong>The 'people's farm'</strong><br/><br/>Fifty years after it all began on that steep hillside across from Stevenson College, the apprenticeship continues to attract applicants from across the country and around the globe. Only one in three are admitted&#8212;a higher ratio than years past as programs around the country have copied the apprenticeship model, says Press. <br/><br/>"This model seems to appeal to people," adds Press, noting that the average age of farmers in the U. S. is 57. "Most of our apprentices don't come from farm families."<br/><br/>The lucky 39 who are selected each year get an education like no other: Apprentices receive 700 hours of field instruction and 300 hours of classroom learning over the course of six months, covering everything from seed propagation to tractor cultivation. This year's cohort includes educators, urban farmers and gardeners, youth empowerment advocates, three graduate students, and several recent college graduates. Apprentices hail from California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Africa.<br/><br/>Current apprentice David Robles is a recent graduate of UC Santa Cruz (History, 2016). As a student, he focused on social movements&#8212;and feels today that he is in the midst of an important one.<br/><br/>"Food affects everybody," says Robles. "Everybody's got to eat, so food is a great way to put environmentalism at the front of people's minds."<br/><br/>But the Center's mission is bigger than just the environment. "When you pay a couple dollars more for organic, locally grown food, you get a couple dollars of justice for the people who grow, process, and distribute your food," says Robles, who plans to work with youth after the apprentice ends in October.<br/><br/>"Youth education is the way to build a movement that revolves around sustainability and empowering people," says Robles, who enjoys the tangible rewards of working the soil&#8212;particularly in an era when threats like climate change can feel overwhelming. "It's a very hands-on approach to making the world a better place. The Center has come a long way over 50 years. It was just about organic gardening, and now it's about the global economy and the global ecosystem. It has gone from a technique to a social movement." <br/><br/><strong>'Grow our own food? That's slavery!'</strong><br/><br/>Apprenticeship graduates carry the mantle forward as farmers, teachers, urban gardeners, community organizers, policy makers, directors of nonprofits that serve veterans and the incarcerated, and more. Karen Washington, a 2008 graduate of the apprenticeship, is a lifelong community activist and a champion of food justice. A co-founder of Black Urban Growers (BUGS) and Rise and Root Farm, located an hour north of New York City, Washington focuses on giving people equal access to soil, whether they are in the Bronx or the suburbs, rich or poor, high school dropouts or Ph.D.'s.<br/><br/>"To grow your own food gives you power and dignity," says Washington, who lives in the Bronx. "For so long in the inner cities, there was a disconnect between where your food was coming from and who was growing it, because of the convenience of going to the supermarket."<br/><br/>Giving urban dwellers the opportunity to grow their own food is empowering&#8212;but not all are initially receptive. "Whites embrace it, but for low-income and people of color, they hear 'Grow our own food' and say 'That's slavery!'" says Washington. "We have to understand that narrative to be able to reshape it. Same with valuing land."<br/><br/>Many blacks fled the South, vowing never to go back. But Washington wants to restore the legacy of those agrarian connections and the culture of agriculture. "When I was in Santa Cruz, it really started to sink in," she recalls. "Looking at the landscape in California, I saw this white-led food movement, and I asked, 'Where are the farmers who look like me? Where are the black farmers? Where are the people of color in the food movement?'"<br/><br/>After she finished the apprenticeship and returned to New York, Washington reached out, hosting a first-ever conference of black farmers. Since that initial gathering in Brooklyn in 2010, the Black Farmers and Urban Gardeners Conference has become an annual meeting, taking place this year in Atlanta. "The conference is a place for people of color to connect and to understand that slavery is part of the American experience, but it doesn't define us as a people," says Washington. "The apprenticeship gave me the experience to see the lack of diversity in the farm movement."<br/><br/>And like hundreds of others, Washington emerged from the apprenticeship with a vision she put in to action. <br/><br/>Back on the campus Farm, Daniel Press says it's tempting to sum up the impact of 50 years with data points about organic farming or sustainable agriculture, but the campus's greatest impact has always been its people. Today, as ever, the Center produces leaders.<br/><br/>"Fifty years ago, I don't imagine the students who transformed that hillside into a lush garden thought of themselves as visionaries, but they were," he says. "We carry on their legacy today, working toward an environmentally sound, socially just food system. And there isn't a prettier, tastier, better way to do this than the way we are doing it at UC Santa Cruz."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://casfs.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/2018-apprenticeship-applications.html</url><title>Inspired to be an apprentice?

More than 1,500 people have graduated from the apprenticeship, and a growing number of UC Santa Cruz undergraduates are taking advantage of learning opportunities at the Farm &amp; Garden; the Center's research program has led to breakthroughs in the organic production of key crops, including strawberries, artichokes, and apples.<br/><br/>Sponsors of the First 50 Celebration include Earthbound Farms, Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, Sun Ridge Farms, Veritable Vegetable, Clif Bar and Company, Heath and Lejeune, Kingbird Farm, Lakeside Organics, Organic Valley, Simply Organics, Tend, and United Natural Foods (UNFI).<br/><br/>It's not too early to mark you calendar for the annual Harvest Festival on October 1 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Farm.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2ec1a2c4807270176bdff325860b141b"><name>international-activities</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New international activities policy</title><summary>The new policy covers all international activities conducted by all UC employees and students including routine activities by setting out governing principles, clarifying approval levels, and directs proponents of international activities to consider and address attendant risk.</summary><start-date>1499065200000</start-date><display-name>Policy</display-name><path>/2017/07/international-activities</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/07/international-activities</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1499728027120</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1499789288624</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California Office of the President has issued a new policy on international activities.</p>

She starts in September.</p>
<p>Ferdolage comes from Humboldt State University where she serves as associate vice president of facilities management.</p>
<p>At Humboldt, Ferdolage is responsible for planning, design, and construction; operations and maintenance; energy and sustainability; parking and commuter Services; and real estate functions.</p>
<p>This new campus position was created by taking the associate vice chancellor for Physical Planning and Construction and restructuring it so that it will now oversee a new unit that combines PP&amp;C, Physical Plant, and Real Estate.</p>
<p>"The major objective of the restructure is to enhance integration of facility planning, acquisition, construction, management, operation, maintenance and renewal in order to better serve the campus," said Sarah Latham, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. "I believe Traci possesses the leadership capabilities to successfully advance this goal."</p>
<p>The search committee was chaired by Steve Stein, associate vice chancellor for Staff Human Resources.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="425385af807270176705df1a4e7650da"><name>padgett-student-success</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jaye Padgett named vice provost for the Division of Student Success</title><summary>I am pleased to announce that Jaye Padgett, interim vice provost for the Division of Student Success, has been formally named to the position.</summary><start-date>1500015600000</start-date><display-name>Jaye Padgett named vice provost for the Division of Student Success</display-name><path>/2017/07/padgett-student-success</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/07/padgett-student-success</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1500056354979</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1500056354979</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>&#65279;I am pleased to announce that Jaye Padgett, interim vice provost for the Division of Student Success, has been formally named to the position. The appointment is for three years, and went into effect July 1. Jaye had held the interim post since fall of 2015. Previous to that, starting in 2013, he worked half time as special assistant to the CP/EVC, focusing on increasing student retention and decreasing the time it takes for students to graduate.<br/><br/>Jaye, a professor of linguistics, is uniquely qualified to undertake this vital role. He has demonstrated exemplary leadership in the division since taking the helm. He also has extensive leadership experience as chair of the Academic Senate's Committee on Educational Policy and as chair of the Linguistics Department. <br/><br/>The appointment is a critical piece of a broader university strategy to strengthen student support inside and outside of the classroom. I will seek input in the coming months from key stakeholders regarding the division's scope and focus. Student Success provides direct support to a diverse undergraduate and graduate student body through a network of programs and services, while also coordinating student-supporting initiatives campuswide. The division&#8217;s ultimate goals are to promote educational equity and to boost the retention, time to degree, and graduation rates of our students.<br/><br/>Jaye earned a B.A. in linguistics and another one in Russian language from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1985. He received his Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 1991 and was a visiting assistant professor for one year at Yale before joining our campus in 1992.<br/><br/>Please join me in thanking Jaye for taking on this critical role.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>CP/EVC Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="525d79b0807270176705df1a121fb3da"><name>origin-life</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Did life begin on land rather than in the sea? </title><summary>A paradigm-shifting hypothesis laid out by UC Santa Cruz astrobiologists David Deamer and Bruce Damer could reshape our idea about the origin of life. </summary><start-date>1500274800000</start-date><display-name>Origin of life</display-name><path>/2017/07/origin-life</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/07/origin-life</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1500325442730</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1501522016164</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/07/images/david-deamer-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/07/images/david-deamer-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-deamer-500px.jpg</name><display-name>david-deamer-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>348255</file-size><width>500</width><height>719</height></image><image-alt>David Deamer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/07/images/david-deamer-80p.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/07/images/david-deamer-80p.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-deamer-80p.jpg</name><display-name>david-deamer-80p.jpg</display-name><file-size>14972</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>David Deamer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor David Deamer&#160;(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>A paradigm-shifting hypothesis laid out by UC Santa Cruz astrobiologists David Deamer and Bruce Damer could reshape our idea about the origin of life </article-subhead><article-text><p>For three years, Tara Djokic, a Ph.D. student at the University of New South Wales Sydney, scoured the forbidding landscape of the Pilbara region of Western Australia looking for clues to how ancient microbes could have produced the abundant stromatolites that were discovered there in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Stromatolites are round, multilayered mineral structures that range from the size of golf balls to weather balloons and represent the oldest evidence that there were living organisms on Earth 3.5 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Scientists who believed life began in the ocean thought these mineral formations had formed in shallow, salty seawater, just like living stromatolites in the World Heritage&#8211;listed area of Shark Bay, which is a two-day drive from the Pilbara.</p>
<p>But what Djokic discovered amid the strangling heat and blood-red rocks of the region was evidence that the stromatolites had not formed in salt water but instead in conditions more like the hot springs of Yellowstone.</p>
<p>The discovery pushed back the time for the emergence of microbial life on land by 580 million years and also bolstered a paradigm-shifting hypothesis laid out by UC Santa Cruz astrobiologists David Deamer and Bruce Damer: that life began, not in the sea, but on land.</p>
<p>Djokic&#8217;s discovery &#8212; together with research carried out by the UC Santa Cruz team, Djokic, and Martin Van Kranendonk, director of the Australian Centre for Astrobiology &#8212; is described in an eight-page cover story in the August issue of <em>Scientific American</em>.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;What she (Djokic) showed was that the oldest fossil evidence for life was in fresh water,&#8221; said Deamer, a lanky 78-year-old who explored the region with Djokic, Damer, and Van Kranendonk in 2015. &#8220;It&#8217;s a logical continuation to life beginning in a freshwater environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The model for life beginning on land rather than in the sea could not only reshape our idea about the origin of life and where else it might be, but even change the way we view ourselves.&#160;</p>
<h3><strong>The right conditions for life</strong></h3>
<p>For four decades, ever since the research vessel <em>Alvin</em> discovered deep-sea hydrothermal vents that were habitats for specialized bacteria and worms that looked like something out of a science-fiction novel, scientists have theorized that these mineral- and gas-pumping vents were just what was needed for life to begin.&#160;</p>
<p>But Deamer, who describes himself as a scientist who loves playing with new ideas, thought the theory had flaws. For instance, molecules essential for the origin of life would be dispersed too quickly into a vast ocean, he thought, and salty seawater would inhibit some of the processes he knew are necessary for life to begin.</p>
<p>Deamer had spent the early part of his career studying the biophysics of membranes composed of soap-like molecules that form the microscopic boundaries of all living cells. Later, given a piece of the Murchison meteorite that had landed in Australia in 1969, Deamer found that the space rock also contained soap-like molecules nearly 5 billion years old that could form stable membranes. Still later, he demonstrated that membranes helped small molecules join together to form longer information-carrying molecules called polymers.</p>
<p>Trekking to volcanoes from Russia to Iceland and hiking through the Pilbara desert, Deamer and his colleagues&#8217; observations of volcanic activity suggested the idea that hot springs provided the right environment for the beginning of life. Deamer even built a machine that simulated the heat, acidity, and wet-and-dry cycles of hot springs and installed it in his lab on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, every once in awhile, you have to be brave enough and bold enough to try new ideas,&#8221; Deamer said. "Of course, some of my colleagues think even &#8216;foolish enough.&#8217; But that's the chance you take."</p>
<h3><strong>Rethinking the timeline</strong></h3>
<p>In Deamer&#8217;s vision, ancient Earth consisted of a huge ocean spotted with volcanic land masses. Rain would fall on the land, creating pools of fresh water that would be heated by geothermal energy and then cooled by runoff. Some of the key building blocks of life, created during the formation of our solar system, would have fallen to Earth and gathered in these pools, becoming concentrated enough to form more complex organic compounds.</p>
<p>The edges of the pools would go through periods of wetting and drying as water levels rose and fell. During these periods of wet and dry, lipid membranes would first help stitch together the organic compounds called polymers and then form compartments that encapsulated different sets of these polymers. The membranes would act like incubators for the functions of life.&#160;</p>
<p>Deamer and his team believe the first life emerged from the natural production of vast numbers of such membrane-encased &#8220;protocells.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there is still debate about whether life began on land or in the sea, the discovery of ancient microbial fossils in a place like the Pilbara shows that these geothermal areas &#8212; full of energy and rich in the minerals necessary for life &#8212; harbored living microorganisms far earlier than believed.</p>
<h3><strong>The search for life on other planets </strong></h3>
<p>According to Deamer and his colleagues, this discovery and their hot-springs-origins model also have implications for the search for life on other planets. If life began on land, then Mars, which was found to have a 3.65-billion-year-old hot spring deposits similar to those found in the Pilbara region of Australia, might be a good place to look.</p>
<p>For Damer, the new &#8220;end-to-end hypothesis&#8221; of how life began on land offers something else: that the origin of life was not just a simple story of individual, competing cells. Rather that a plausible new vision of life&#8217;s start could be a communal unit of protocells that survived and evolved through collaboration and sharing of innovation rather than strict competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a fundamental shift that might impact how we think of our world, ourselves, and our future: as dependent on collaboration as much as being driven by competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting in his fourth-floor office on campus, Deamer smiled as he recounted the letter Charles Darwin wrote to a friend in 1871, which speculated that life might have begun in &#8220;some warm little pond.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not far off the mark, Deamer said, &#8220;except we call ours &#8216;hot little puddles.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;</p>

the project will estimate the supply of wood biomass in the area east of the central Sierra crest and in western Nevada, and assess the possibility of producing wood products from that supply.<br/><br/>Funds will be used to support the creation and management of a special committee, led by Joshua Harrison, co-director of the UCSC center. The multidisciplinary, bi-state team will then cultivate local businesses in the area that can generate useful products from wood biomass.<br/><br/>The aim of the grant--part of $8.3 million in distributed funds just announced by the U.S. Forest Service--is to stimulate the removal of hazardous fuels from forests to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires and promote forest health, while at the same time spurring the economic development of rural communities. <br/><br/>&#8220;Our first step is to get a much better estimate of the supply--the amount of timber by species along with brush and other biomass available in the WUT (Wood Utilization Team) region which covers a big chunk of the Eastern Central Sierra around Lake Tahoe and a matching section of Western Nevada,&#8221; said Harrison. &#8220;We need to understand better how much wood and woody biomass is available using an environmental analysis that protects endangered species habitat, wetlands and riparian areas, and prioritizes 10-inch and smaller diameter trees--in effect what we&#8217;re calling the &#8216;environmental cut.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Our next step is to take that supply information and work with some partners to identify a range of potential uses--from soil additives, to pallets, fence posts, pellets, wood chips, traditional timber and a range of manufactured woods, along with the economic potential of each use.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;Finally, we will take our research and add market need and economic analysis to build a strategic economic overview which we will publish,&#8221; he added. <br/><br/>Harrison noted that in addition to working with a range of public and private partners to find specific users and manufacturers, the end goal of the project is to have both California and Nevada become states with a &#8220;Wood First&#8221; orientation, where they officially rely upon renewable wood-based resources for major construction and housing projects.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5d03b2ae807270176705df1a9fdc4b7b"><name>athletics-future</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Intercollegiate athletics program charts course into the future</title><summary>The NCAA Division III program, which has been under a budget cloud for the past several years, can now confidently look toward the future.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NCAA Division III program, which has been under a budget cloud for the past several years, can now confidently look toward the future. The program has been bolstered by a new student fee, was recently restructured so it aligns with other successful Division III programs in the nation, and will head into the coming season with more awareness than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a historic moment for Banana Slugs,&#8221; said Andrea Willer, executive director of OPERS. &#8220;Our NCAA program has more support than ever before. People are engaged and eager to watch this program as it begins a new chapter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NCAA program, established in 1980, consists of 15 men and women&#8217;s teams, which have about 270 students on the rosters. The average GPA well exceeds the campus average and the program has boasted a 100 percent academic retention rate for the past five years. The teams have gone on to compete in championships and students have received scholar-athlete honors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until recently, the intercollegiate program was at a crossroads. Campus leaders asked that the program develop a new way to fund itself so that it was less reliant on core campus funds, which are needed to support the academic mission of the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students in May backed a $38.50-per-quarter fee that will provide the program with a new revenue source and time to better develop other revenue streams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The approved fee was significantly less than what had been previously proposed&#8212;and didn&#8217;t gain support. As a result, the intercollegiate athletics program developed a new, sustainable business model that could provide a roadmap forward. The model calls for a structure that is based off other NCAA Division III programs without football and also seeks to grow revenue through other channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fee this year will generate about $1.1 million, just under half of its $2.3 million budget for the coming year. The remaining funding will come from a campus commitment of $500,000, ticket sales, fundraising, summer campus, and sponsorships of about $300,000; and a five-year apparel contract with Under Armour, the only Division III program with such a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To strengthen the program while also managing costs, the campus made several changes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head coaches have three-year contracts with full benefits and a 3 percent salary increase above last year&#8217;s salaries. The campus will spend $622,203 (fiscal year 2018) on head coach salaries, an increase over last year which puts it above the NCAA D-III median of $449,763 (fiscal year 2016).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All head coaches have 100 percent appointments and will be able to teach physical education and run summer camps, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant coaches will work under six-month contracts with benefits, and the campus added another assistant coach for track and field, bringing the total number of assistant coaches to 11.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the changes&#8212;such as higher salaries for head coaches&#8212;have been welcomed, Willer said. Still, she acknowledged other changes&#8212;such as seeking new coaches for two sports&#8212;have caused confusion and frustration with some athletes and coaches. She&#8217;s been meeting with coaches and teams to explain the changes and listen to their concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Change can be hard, but I know we will be a stronger program in the long run,&#8221; Willer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus now is on recruiting coaches for swimming, women&#8217;s soccer, and cross country. The jobs were posted July 10, and the campus expects to have the spots filled in August. Players will serve on the hiring committee to review the candidates. In the 2017-18 year, Willer plans to hire a new athletics director. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will look to the head coaches to inform the best strategy and timing for hiring a new athletics director to ensure we can generate the best pool of candidates possible," Willer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major component of the new business model is to steadily reduce the reliance on the student fee, which is set to expire in spring 2042. The program will need to gradually increase the amount of fundraising, ticket sales, and summer camp revenue to grow the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are excited to usher in a new era for Slug athletics,&#8221; said men&#8217;s basketball head coach Ron DuBois. &#8220;As a coach it feels great to have been shown this overwhelming support from the students and administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have so many positives here at UCSC and now our program is competitively positioned for the future."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, the athletic program will have a staff member who will help with fundraising. Without any dedicated help, the program typically has been able to fundraise about $200,000 in outside support. That figure is expected to grow with the added support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus also signed an agreement with Under Armour to provide team uniforms and other financial support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students have shown us that they want to see intercollegiate athletics at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Willer said. &#8220;Now, it&#8217;s up to us to follow this model so that we can build the best program for our campus.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5d823803807270176705df1a1a22bb99"><name>library</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Library receives Recordings at Risk grant to preserve Cabrillo Festival tapes</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is the recipient of a Recordings at Risk grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources to digitize 69 open-reel audiotapes of live music performances from the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music.</summary><start-date>1500513600000</start-date><display-name>Library receives recordings at risk grant </display-name><path>/2017/07/library</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/07/library</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1500512400109</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1500588156272</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Library</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/07/images/library-grant-music-manuscript-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/07/images/library-grant-music-manuscript-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>library-grant-music-manuscript-250.jpg</name><display-name>library-grant-music-manuscript-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>61175</file-size><width>250</width><height>208</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/07/images/library-grant-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/07/images/library-grant-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>library-grant-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>library-grant-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17389</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>UC Santa Cruz is one of seven recipients of a pilot grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). The <em>Recordings at Risk</em> award is designed to support the preservation of rare and unique audio content of high scholarly value.<br/>
<p>The University Library&#8217;s Special Collections will use the grant to digitize 69 open-reel audiotapes of live music performances from the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music.</p>
<p>These recordings were originally made by Berkeley community radio station&#160;<em>KPFA. </em>They were later transferred to the Bay Area music non-profit organization, Other Minds, which last year&#160;<strong><em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/other-minds-archive.html">donated its archives</a> </em></strong>to UC Santa Cruz. The reel-to-reel tape format is particularly susceptible to degradation, and this grant ensures that the recordings will be preserved for future use.</p>
<p>These recordings provide insights into the early creative processes of composers and artists who are recognized influencers of American new music. They will be made available on demand to patrons both on-site and via remote access.</p>
<p>&#8220;This material allows us to glimpse into the intersection of experimental new music and progressive independent radio, which converged at the Cabrillo Music Festival," said archivist Kate Dundon of Special Collections &amp; Archives. "We anticipate that it will be used by musicologists, historians, composers, students, and others interested in experimental and avant-garde music.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221;For this grant, we worked with Other Minds to select several world premieres of European composers at the Cabrillo Festival from 1965, 1967, and 1982, as well as a few John Cage pieces," Dundon added. "We anticipate that the recordings will be available to researchers in April 2018.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/other-minds-archive.html</url><title>Other Minds donates archives to UC Santa Cruz</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="61299026807270176705df1a0db6ba31"><name>community-day</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community day highlights college pathways, accessibility </title><start-date>1500534000000</start-date><display-name>Access to higher education</display-name><path>/2017/07/community-day</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/07/community-day</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1500573698888</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1500573698888</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/07/images/students-bridge.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/07/images/students-bridge.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>students-bridge.jpg</name><display-name>students-bridge.jpg</display-name><file-size>310805</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Students on bridge</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an effort to highlight community resources and the college/career preparatory programs at Seaside and Marina high schools, UC Santa Cruz and CSU Monterey Bay are hosting a community day on&#160;Aug. 19.&#160;</p>

The brilliant explosion, more than three times as bright as the 100 billion stars of our Milky Way galaxy combined, occurred about 3.5 billion years after the big bang at a period known as "cosmic high noon," when the rate of star formation in the universe reached its peak.</p>
<p>Superluminous supernovae are 10 to 100 times brighter than a typical supernova resulting from the collapse of a massive star. But astronomers still don't know exactly what kinds of stars give rise to their extreme luminosity or what physical processes are involved.</p>
<p>The supernova known as DES15E2mlf is unusual even among the small number of superluminous supernovae astronomers have detected so far. It was initially detected in November 2015 by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) collaboration using the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Follow-up observations to measure the distance and obtain detailed spectra of the supernova were conducted with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on the 8-meter Gemini South telescope.</p>
<p>The investigation was led by UC Santa Cruz astronomers Yen-Chen Pan and Ryan Foley as part of an international team of DES collaborators. The researchers reported their findings in a<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/mnras/stx1467"> paper published July 21 in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em></a>.</p>
<p>The new observations may provide clues to the nature of stars and galaxies during peak star formation. Supernovae are important in the evolution of galaxies because their explosions enrich the interstellar gas from which new stars form with elements heavier than helium (which astronomers call "metals").</p>
<p>"It's important simply to know that very massive stars were exploding at that time," said Foley, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "What we really want to know is the relative rate of superluminous supernovae to normal supernovae, but we can't yet make that comparison because normal supernovae are too faint to see at that distance. So we don't know if this atypical supernova is telling us something special about that time 10 billion years ago."</p>
<p>Previous observations of superluminous supernovae found they typically reside in low-mass or dwarf galaxies, which tend to be less enriched in metals than more massive galaxies. The host galaxy of DES15E2mlf, however, is a fairly massive, normal-looking galaxy.</p>
<p>"The current idea is that a low-metal environment is important in creating superluminous supernovae, and that's why they tend to occur in low mass galaxies, but DES15E2mlf is in a relatively massive galaxy compared to the typical host galaxy for superluminous supernovae," said Pan, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the paper.</p>
<p>Foley explained that stars with fewer heavy elements retain a larger fraction of their mass when they die, which may cause a bigger explosion when the star exhausts its fuel supply and collapses.</p>
<p>"We know metallicity affects the life of a star and how it dies, so finding this superluminous supernova in a higher-mass galaxy goes counter to current thinking," Foley said. "But we are looking so far back in time, this galaxy would have had less time to create metals, so it may be that at these earlier times in the universe's history, even high-mass galaxies had low enough metal content to create these extraordinary stellar explosions. At some point, the Milky Way also had these conditions and might have also produced a lot of these explosions."</p>
<p>"Although many puzzles remain, the ability to observe these unusual supernovae at such great distances provides valuable information about the most massive stars and about an important period in the evolution of galaxies," said Mat Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Southampton. The Dark Energy Survey has discovered a number of superluminous supernovae and continues to see more distant cosmic explosions revealing how stars exploded during the strongest period of star formation.</p>
<p>In addition to Pan, Foley, and Smith, the coauthors of the paper include Llu&#237;s Galbany of the University of Pittsburgh, and other members of the DES collaboration from more than 40 institutions.

<p>A new center and child care program are part of the plan for additional student housing. The center and the program were&#160;announced May 31&#160;in a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/05/childcare-services-employee-housing.html">campus message</a> from Chancellor Blumenthal and then interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee.</p>
<p>All interested campus community members are invited to attend. The forums will provide attendees the opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas with members of the work group organized to develop the program for the expanded center.</p>
<p>In addition, a <a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/housing/studenthousingwest/child-care-center.html">web page</a> has been published that provides information about the planned new center and program.

<p>"There's a saying that the best fertilizer is the footsteps of the farmer&#8212;or, as I like to say, the shadow of the gardener," says Martin, who this month celebrates his 40th anniversary with the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>At 68, Martin could retire, but he isn't remotely interested.</p>
<p>"When I'm here at first light, with the fog lifting, it's a transcendental moment," he says. "Like when you hear the first few notes of a John Coltrane saxophone solo, and the hair on the back of your neck stands up, and every cell in your body knows you're alive."</p>
<p>Thus speaks a man in love with his work. Martin remains fully engaged with all aspects of his job as manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden: planting, propagating, pruning&#8212;and passing on the knowledge he has acquired over four decades.</p>
<p>"I get to hang around really bright, motivated Gen X'ers and Millennials who go on to succeed at things I would never dare to try," Martin says of the students and apprentices with whom he shares his days. "I just love these kids. They are so intrinsically motivated. They want you to teach them, and they want to go out and do things. They're the light of the world."</p>
<p>If it sounds like Martin has the dream job, he'd be the first to tell you no one would have predicted it 40 years ago.</p>

<h2>An unlikely gardener</h2>
<p>"Growing up, gardening to me was an onerous chore my old man made me do when I messed up," Martin recalls.</p>
<p>That changed after his arrival in Santa Cruz from Boston in 1969. Having dropped out of college and evaded the draft, he landed in town, heard about the fledgling campus garden, and began to spend time up on the hill.&#160;</p>
<p>Only two years before, Alan Chadwick had been hired by the university to establish a campus garden. He chose the steep, rocky, poison oak-covered hillside below Merrill College to prove that gardens can flourish anywhere.</p>
<p>And flourish it did, without chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Chadwick, a charismatic man who attracted a loyal band of hardworking students, introduced biodynamic, French-intensive gardening, using compost to enrich the soil and tight plantings to outcompete the weeds. Martin volunteered in the garden and was inspired as the hillside came to life. Off campus, he helped establish a network of local community gardens. In 1977, a few years after Chadwick left, when UC offered Martin a job managing the garden at the princely salary of $600 per month, he snapped it up.</p>
<p>Before long, the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture was reinstated, following a lull in the wake of Chadwick's departure, and Martin's career as a master gardener and professional educator began in earnest.</p>
<p>As a teacher, scholar, scientist, and poet, Martin considers himself a perpetual student, still curious and inquisitive. Looking back on 40 years, he smiles and says, "I've never had a real job. I have no academic background. I've learned by the seat of my pants."</p>

<h2>Trial and error yields success</h2>
<p>The farm and garden are "outdoor laboratories" for university research on pollinators, soil biology, predatory insects and parasites, crop yields, weed suppression, and more.</p>
<p>"We had no idea about the vast complexity of soil biology, but by happenstance, we created the Farm and Garden with tremendous biodiversity above and below the ground," says Martin. "This was way before anyone talked about sustainability or food systems or food access. There was no organic food industry."</p>
<p>Today, the Farm and Garden operate under the auspices of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), which is the oldest university-based organic research and education facility in the country.</p>
<p>"Orin is a miracle of mentorship. He is a classic teacher, driven equally by his wonder for gardens and the pure joy he gets in seeing his apprentices and students learn," says CASFS Executive Director Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies. "If Santa Cruz ever has a 'Gardener Laureate,' Orin Martin should be the first one.&#8221;</p>
<p>And like sun-dried seed pods that crack open to cast their contents far and wide, Martin and the other Farm and Garden instructors have spread their knowledge literally around the globe by training more than 1,500 apprentices and a growing number of undergraduates, and by publishing texts, handbooks, and online manuals.</p>
<h2>Sharing knowledge</h2>
<p>The apprenticeship today is a full-time, six-month residential program; it was scaled back from 12 months in 1981, in part because participants found it challenging to take that much time off&#8212;and instructors were drained by the intensive style of teaching with no break between sessions.</p>
<p>"We teach in the apprentice tradition, working side by side in the field," says Martin. "Teaching is superimposed on the maintenance and upkeep of the garden."</p>
<p>Field work is fused with the scholastic model: apprentices receive 800 hours of field instruction and 300 hours of classroom instruction. For instructors, the workload has increased over the years as CASFS has added a formal internship program for UC Santa Cruz undergraduates. Now, in addition to teaching 39 apprentices each year, Martin and his colleagues teach 25 UCSC student interns each quarter&#8212;and turn away an equal number who would enroll if they could. "It's a mini-apprenticeship with instruction in soil and bed preparation, propagation, crops, fruit trees and pruning, soil fertility, and cover crops," says Martin.</p>

<h2>A legacy of doing things for people you may never meet<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h2>
<p>All around the Farm and Chadwick Garden, the legacy of previous apprentices is evident.</p>
<p>"For 50 years, people have been doing things for people they might never meet," says Martin. "Starting with clearing the brush for the garden and taking a pick axe to the rock-hard soil."</p>
<p>Subsequent cohorts installed irrigation, built greenhouses, broke sod to establish the Farm, and&#8212;always&#8212;nourished the sandy, nutrient-deficient soil.</p>
<p>Today, the garden's soil is "dreamy," like a three-foot layer of chocolate cake, says Martin.&#160;</p>
<p>The science of soil systems and organic farming has advanced exponentially, as has the knowledge of Martin and other professional staff. And today there is a vibrant network of graduates, who support and open doors for each other as urban farmers, environmental educators, community gardeners, and more.</p>
<p>"It's a great experience to get in on the ground level of anything, but people who come now experience the maturity and robustness of the program. I don't know which one is better," muses Martin.</p>

<h2>What's next<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></h2>
<p>After years of operating on soft funding and being better-known off campus than on, the Center is enjoying increased visibility and greater financial stability.</p>
<p>"We'd be better-suited to a community college," says Martin. "And yet it's great for both sides of the equation that we are here. Educational fashions change, and now internships and hands-on learning are in vogue."</p>
<p>A legendary storyteller, Martin's tale of his own affiliation with the Farm and Garden is rich with references to others who have traveled the path with him, including Founding Chancellor Dean McHenry ("a Lompoc farm boy who knew the value of the ag lifestyle") and Louise Cain and Phyllis Norris, wives of faculty members Stanley Cain and Ken Norris ("in another time, Louise and Phyllie would've been the CEOs running companies, but they were faculty wives, and they poured all their energy into this place"). So many have been part of what Martin calls the "narratives of grace" that have enabled this unique program to endure.</p>
<p>"They could see the germ of this place even before organic farming became trendy," he says.</p>
<p>Although he diligently avoids bureaucracy (he functioned for years without email and rarely uses the telephone), Martin has been an ardent advocate for the Farm &amp; Garden. Above all, he is beloved by apprentices and colleagues. One even named her baby after him.</p>
<p>On July 11, a small group of apprentices, staff, and friends gathered amid the resplendent roses of the Alan Chadwick Garden to honor Orin Martin for 40 years of service.</p>
<p>Martin spoke first, pausing to compose himself as he recognized the 1,500 apprentices who "dug up the meadow&#8230; and made the soil," as well as his colleagues and CASFS leaders. "I guess what I wanted to say is thank <em>you</em>," he said.</p>
<p>Among those paying tribute was Christof Bernau, a 1994 apprenticeship graduate and garden manager of the Farm who has worked alongside Martin for almost 20 years. He read from a poem written on the occasion of Martin's 25th work anniversary by then-apprentice Erin Barnett: "Like all good farmers, Orin is still growing, still learning, and still immensely dedicated to the craft."</p>
<p>Damian Parr, research and education coordinator for CASFS, spoke affectionately of the garden and Martin's role in it: "You facilitate everyone's connection to it. You've been a 'yes.' That's how I think of you. You've been a 'yes' to everyone who wishes to connect with this place."</p>
<p>Presented with a trademark yellow pad and a Sharpie, Orin said: "I'm a rich man. I have no money in my pockets and I have holes in my jeans, but I am a rich man."</p>

<p>Aspiring organic farmers and gardeners are invited to apply for the 2018 Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Now celebrating its 50th year, the Apprenticeship is the longest running university-based organic farming training program in the U.S.</p>
<p>The six-month, full-time residential program takes place at the 30-acre organic farm and 3-acre Alan Chadwick Garden on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The Apprenticeship blends experiential learning with traditional classroom studies on topics that include soil management, composting, pest and weed control, crop planning, irrigation, farm equipment, direct marketing techniques, business planning, and social and environmental issues in the food system.</p>
<p>The upcoming six-month program runs from April 9, 2018 to October 19, 2018. <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship/apprenticeship-information/fee-waiver-opportunities.html">Scholarship support</a> at different levels is available, including the new Food Justice and Equity Scholarship.</p>
<p>With major support from <a href="http://www.bamco.com">Bon App&#233;tit Management Company</a>, the new scholarship is intended to support incoming apprentices presently committed to and engaged in creating food justice and equity in their communities and/or advocacy for responsible stewardship of the Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainable food production, education, and social justice work are more important now than ever.&#160; We are thrilled to help ensure people from underserved communities have access to the incredible training the Apprenticeship provides,&#8221; says Maisie Ganzler, chief strategy and brand officer for Bon App&#233;tit Management Company.</p>
<p>The scholarship will be used to financially support individuals from low-income communities that historically have been underrepresented, and who would otherwise be unable to attend the program. Scholarships cover part or all of the course fee and on-site housing is available for free. Other scholarship support for the Apprenticeship includes the Matthew Raiford Scholarship for veterans, and the Simply Organic annual scholarship. AmeriCorps funding can also be used to cover course fees.</p>
<h3>Application and program information</h3>
<p>The Apprenticeship is managed by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems at UCSC. It is open to all participants 21 years or older, regardless of educational background.</p>
<p>Program information, application materials, details on scholarship support, and a list of dates for upcoming orientation tours are available online at <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship">casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship</a>. Application deadlines for the 2018 program are August 15, 2017 for international applicants, and September 30, 2017 for U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>The 39 apprentices accepted into the program each year come from all regions of the U.S. and abroad, and represent a wide spectrum of ages, backgrounds, and interests.</p>
<p>Program graduates have established their own commercial farms and market gardens, developed farm- and garden-based educational programs, run urban garden programs, and more.

<p>They were honored for their contributions to the field at the <a href="http://naec2017.holycross.edu/home">2017 North American Echinoderm Conference</a>, which took place July 9 to 13 in Worcester, Massachusetts. The conference opened with a plenary session dedicated to recognizing the Pearses for their many contributions to and support of echinoderm research and researchers. Three former students who worked with them as undergraduate or graduate students at UC Santa Cruz gave presentations, followed by talks by both John and Vicki Pearse.</p>
<p>The Pearses have shared their knowledge and enthusiasm for marine invertebrates with a multitude of students and colleagues. The two have worked separately and as a team, and although their studies have focused mostly on the California coast, they have ranged from tropical to Antarctic waters. Since his retirement in 1994, John has continued to teach, conduct research, and write as a professor emeritus affiliated with the Institute of Marine Sciences.</p>
<p>John and Vicki Pearse were both honored in 2008 with a lifetime achievement award from the Western Society of Naturalists. Together with Vicki's parents, Ralph and Mildred Buchsbaum, they revised the classic invertebrate zoology textbook <em>Animals Without Backbones</em> and wrote another, <em>Living Invertebrates</em>, first published in 1987. They coedited the seven-volume treatise <em>Reproduction of Marine Invertebrates</em> and are fellows of the California Academy of Sciences. John Pearse has served as president of the California Academy of Sciences, the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, and the International Society of Invertebrate Reproduction. In 2011, he received the California Academy of Sciences Fellows' Medal, its highest honor. Vicki Pearse served as president of the American Microscopical Society and was the founding editor of the journal <em>Invertebrate Biology</em>.</p>
<p>The three former students who gave plenary talks honoring the Pearses were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isidro 'Sid' Bosch</strong>, professor of biology at SUNY Geneseo in Geneseo, New York. Bosch received his B.A. in aquatic biology at UC Santa Barbara and his Ph.D. in biology at UC Santa Cruz under the direction of John Pearse. He has been a member of the faculty at SUNY Geneseo since 1992. Bosch has also worked closely with Vicki Pearse, studying larval feeding in the Antarctic and California. He has garnered awards for excellence in both teaching and research and has published a large body of work on both marine and freshwater organisms.</li>
<li><strong>James B. McClintock</strong>, university professor of polar and marine biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. McClintock worked with John Pearse as both an undergraduate student and as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow. He received his B.S. degree at UC Santa Cruz and his Ph.D. from the University of South Florida. He became a full professor at UAB in 1997 and has served as dean of the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and as interim dean of the Graduate School. McClintock&#8217;s research focuses on aspects of marine invertebrate nutrition and reproduction and Antarctic marine chemical ecology. He has been the recipient of numerous awards and distinctions including recognition for excellence in teaching and research.</li>
<li><strong>Ben Miner</strong>, associate professor of biology at Western Washington University. Miner earned his B.A. at UC Santa Cruz and was advised in his research by John Pearse and Grant Pogson. He received his doctorate from the University of Florida and did postdoctoral studies at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory and Center for Population Biology. His recent research has focused on the underlying causes and ecological ramifications of sea star wasting disease in the Pacific Ocean.</li>

<p>Presented by Columbia University&#8217;s Graduate School of Journalism, the Cabot Prizes honor career excellence and coverage of the Western Hemisphere that furthers inter-American understanding.</p>
<p>Established in 1938, they are the oldest international awards in the field of journalism.</p>
<p>Miroff writes for the <em>Washington Post</em> about Latin American politics and foreign relations, covering a beat that includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>He graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2000, where he studied Spanish and Latin American literature. Miroff went on to earn a masters degree from the UC Berkeley School of Journalism in 2006.</p>
<p>In 2014, he returned to UC Santa Cruz as a guest for the Creative Writing Program&#8217;s <em>Living Writers Series</em>. Miroff participated in a panel of fellow alumni journalists that included Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Associated Press </em>reporter, Martha Mendoza, and <em>Time</em> magazine's Washington D.C. Bureau Chief, Michael Scherer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nick Miroff&#8217;s lively and eloquent stories show how people in Latin America are being buffeted by violence and political change,&#8221; noted the Columbia announcement of Miroff&#8217;s Cabot award.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Amazon lowlands of Ecuador, he revealed how the construction of an oil pipeline fueled deadly rivalries among indigenous tribes. In northern Mexico he observed, through the eyes of an American priest, the ravages in rural villages caught between feuding drug cartels. His prescient reporting foretold the rush of migrants from Central America to the United States and the rising death toll in illegal border crossings."</p>
<p>"More recently, he followed guerrillas in Colombia emerging after decades in the jungle to an unfamiliar condition called peace.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="65b512118072701752a34ca30fb3666a"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2017/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/07/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1483470082557</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483470082557</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
