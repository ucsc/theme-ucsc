Presented by the <a href="http://www.santacruzmuseum.org/public-programs/special-events/">Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History</a>, Griggs' talk is entitled "Perils in Paradise: A brief history of geology and natural disasters in Santa Cruz County." Admission is $10 for museum members, $15 general admission, and $30 for "gold circle" seating.</p>
<p>The Santa Cruz region has a long history of natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, landslides, and coastal erosion. In his talk, Griggs will consider what the region's past can tell us about its future. The landscape that has drawn people to Santa Cruz for decades is shaped by the same geological processes and climate that have periodically wreaked havoc on the community. Paradise comes with a price, Griggs says, and climate change may be raising the ante.</p>
<p>A distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, Griggs directs the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. His research and teaching have focused on the coast of California for nearly half a century and include processes, hazards, and the impacts of sea-level rise. The author of eight books, he has been writing a column for the <em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em>, 'Our Ocean Backyard,' for the past 9 years.</p>

The grant supports efforts to link the infiltration of surface water into the ground with improvements in water quality.</p>
<p>Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and Chad Saltikov, professor and chair of microbiology and environmental toxicology, are the principal investigators for the three-year project, which builds on a pilot study funded by the <a href="http://ucwater.org/">UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</a> (UC Water) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. For the past two years, Fisher, Saltikov, and their students and collaborators have been working to understand how microbes living in soil might contribute to water quality improvements as surface water becomes groundwater.</p>
<p>In addition to extending this research, the new project will connect with a regional effort, launched in October 2016, to increase and improve groundwater supplies by providing incentives for landowners to collect stormwater in "recharge ponds" for infiltration into aquifers. The UCSC researchers are collaborating with the Resource Conservation District (RCD) of Santa Cruz County and the Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency (PVWMA) as part of this new Recharge Net Metering program.</p>
<p>"The program helps to offset costs for landowners if they place successful infiltration and recharge projects on their properties. With this new grant, we can focus on development and application of practices that can help to achieve simultaneous improvements to water supply and quality," said Fisher, who has been studying groundwater issues in the Pajaro Valley for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>Beneficial microbes</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, Fisher has focused on identifying the best sites for recharge ponds and helping to design, install, and test the performance of groundwater recharge systems. Saltikov is an expert in microbial processes that control the fate and transport of contaminants in the environment. Field experiments run by Fisher, Saltikov and their team in 2015 and 2016 have explored how materials added to soils can help to stimulate beneficial microbial activity.</p>
<p>"The microbes that live in the soil can be enlisted as allies, helping to clean the water as it flows in from the surface and becomes groundwater," Saltikov explained. "The integration of next-generation DNA sequencing technology with hydrologic lab and field studies will give us a new and powerful approach for understanding how water percolating into the ground is influenced by microbes living in the soil."</p>
<p>Fisher has been working with RCD and PVWMA partners to raise state and federal funding to build stormwater collection and infiltration systems, and to find locations where these systems are most likely to work. Each stormwater project is intended to generate at least 100 acre-feet per year of infiltration benefit. An "acre-foot" is equivalent to one foot of water covering one acre of land, about enough water to meet the needs of two families of four for a year.</p>
<p>The PVWMA will provide rebates to offset landowner costs for operation and maintenance of these stormwater systems. The remaining piece that had been missing was funding for evaluation of project effectiveness and for research to figure out how to make the projects work better and create multiple benefits.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which funds cutting-edge scientific research and wants to see results transferred from the lab to common practice," said Fisher.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable groundwater management</strong></p>
<p>The timing of this project is ideal, he said, as California recently enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), the first statewide legislation for managing groundwater in California's history. Groundwater basins around the state are scrambling to organize new agencies and develop management plans, including "best practices" that can be applied to achieve long-term sustainability goals.</p>
<p>"This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity to change the way critical water resources are viewed and managed, and this part of the state is ahead in many ways in terms of developing and adopting innovative methods," Fisher said.</p>
<p>Each infiltration system is different, and what works in one place might not work in another. With this grant, Fisher, Saltikov, and their students and partners hope to learn how and why different soils are more or less effective in creating cleaner groundwater. This will make it easier to select appropriate sites and practices and to make sure that valuable resources are used in ways that provide benefits to the environment and support farms and cities.</p>

Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Innovations in "spintronics" have led some to predict the eventual emergence of a universal memory technology to replace all others</article-subhead><article-text><p>Today's computers often use as many as four different kinds of memory technology, from the hard drive to the memory chips, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. A new memory technology may be poised to disrupt this landscape, however, with a unique combination of features. It goes by the unwieldy acronym STT-MRAM, which stands for spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory.</p>
<p>"All other memory technologies are good at some things and not so good at others. People are hoping that STT-MRAM can be good at everything," said electrical engineer Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>As one of 15 partners in the Samsung Global MRAM Innovation program, Schmidt's lab is collaborating with Samsung researchers to help develop this emerging memory technology. With his expertise in optoelectronics, Schmidt is using optical techniques based on ultra-short laser pulses to study preproduction prototype devices from Samsung. His assessments are helping the company optimize their materials and fabrication processes.</p>
<p><strong>Nanomagnets</strong></p>
<p>STT-MRAM stores information in the magnetic states of tiny magnetic elements or "nanomagnets" less than 100 nanometers across. Unlike other magnetic storage technologies, such as hard drives with their spinning disks and magnetic read-write heads, STT-MRAM devices have no moving parts because they use electric current to read and write data. Although current implementations still have plenty of room for improvement, the technology offers the potential for high-speed, high-density, energy-efficient memory that is nonvolatile, meaning stored information is not lost when the power is cut off.</p>
<p>Several key advances in physics and materials science over the past 20 years have led to the development of STT-MRAM and other so-called spintronic technologies. While electronic devices are based on the movement of electrical charges, spintronics exploits another property of electrons called spin. Spin is one of those bizarre concepts of quantum mechanics without a direct equivalent in our macroscopic world. Suffice it to say that electrons behave as if they were spinning, producing a small magnetic moment (like a tiny bar magnet with north and south poles) that can interact with other electrons and atoms in a material.</p>
<p>The nanomagnets in an STT-MRAM device, called spin valves or magnetic tunnel junctions, have two magnetic layers separated by a thin barrier through which electric current can flow. When the spins in the two magnetic layers are aligned, resistance is low, and if the two layers have opposite spins resistance is high, providing two readable and switchable states to represent 0 and 1 in the binary logic of computers.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Spin transfer</strong></p>
<p>The ability to switch the state of a spin valve with an electric current was a critical innovation. A polarized current in which the spins of the electrons are aligned can transfer that spin state to one of the magnetic layers as it passes through, a phenomenon called spin-transfer torque (STT).</p>
<p>STT-MRAM chips for niche applications are just beginning to reach the market, and dozens of companies are working to optimize the technology for use in consumer electronics.</p>
<p>According to Schmidt, one of the challenges is to operate the chips with as little power as possible so they don't heat up too much. How much current it takes to switch a nanomagnet depends on damping, or how long it takes to settle down into a new spin state, he explained. Measuring damping parameters in an array of nanomagnets is extremely challenging, but Schmidt's lab is able to do this using short laser pulses. He and his collaborators, led by graduate student and first author Mike Jaris, reported their latest findings in a <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4967848">paper published in <em>Applied Physics Letters</em></a>.</p>
<p>"We were able to extract damping measurements from prototype devices and show the effects of the fabrication process on the material properties of the nanomagnets," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Samsung has been exciting for his lab, he said, giving his students the opportunity to work at the cutting edge of an emerging technology. "It's a completely different type of memory, and I expect to see it used in more applications over the next few years," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6acf02898072701752a34ca3d5821ba5"><name>power-outage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Power outage at main campus</title><summary>Power has been restored to all of the main campus.</summary><start-date>1483556400000</start-date><display-name>Power Outage</display-name><path>/2017/01/power-outage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/power-outage</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1483555667293</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483644704326</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/power-outage-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/power-outage-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>power-outage-80px.jpg</name><display-name>power-outage-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>12774</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>This page will be updated as more information is available.<br/>

<p><strong>9:19 p.m.</strong>&#8212;Power has been restored to all areas of the main campus, including Natural Sciences 2 Building, Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, and the Center for Adaptive Optics Building.</p>
<p><strong>7:41 p.m.</strong><em>&#8212;</em>PG&amp;E restored power to the main campus at about 5 p.m.. Staff from the Physical Plant then began bringing the campus online. Power has been restored to most of campus. However, crews are still working to restore power to the Natural Sciences 2 Building, Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, and the Center for Adaptive Optics Building.&#160;The campus will send a follow-up email once power is restored to the remaining buildings.</p>
<p>The power outage was caused by a tree that fell on a PG&amp;E power line that supplies campus with power.</p>
<p><strong>2:45 p.m.</strong>&#8212;Due to the extended length of the campus power outage, a number of IT services are impacted including CruzNet and eduroam wireless access, cellular telephone service, and campus VoIP telephones.</p>
<p><strong>12:58 p.m.&#8212;</strong>Given the unknown duration of the power outage, employees whose workplace is without power may be released by their supervisors to leave the workplace. Employees who are scheduled to work during this time but cannot will be granted administrative leave with pay for their regular working hours.</p>
<p>Employees coming to campus to begin their shifts during this time should check the campus website for updates.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Welcome back! As we prepare for the new quarter, I would like to invite you to join us for this year&#8217;s Taking UCSC Home (TUCSCH) program! Taking UCSC Home grants a unique opportunity for current UCSC students to develop valuable professional skills while encouraging higher education within their communities. As an ambassador, we ask that you return to your high school and/or community college during spring break (March 27 &#8211; 31, 2017) to discuss your experience as a UCSC student and to inspire students to consider UCSC as their next educational institution.</span></p>
<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><span>How does the program work?</span> <span>UCSC Admissions Office will offer a step-by-step training on how to contact your former school and set up an appointment, how to answer common UCSC questions, and where to direct students&#8217; questions. We also provide admissions outreach materials for you to use.</span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"></span></span> 
<p dir="ltr"><span>Goal of TUCSCH?</span> <span>The purpose is to inspire high school and transfer students to attend a university/college, promote and showcase UCSC through your own personal and professional experience, and to become a leader within your community. (You are not expected to be an expert on admissions or UCSC but to serve as an ambassador highlighting your experience as a current UCSC student).</span></p>

<p>UC and Teamsters Local 2010 have been unable to reach agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, and the union has called for a systemwide strike.</p>
<p>At this time, we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus. However, we expect that participants in a strike will remain respectful of the rights and needs of the broader campus community and that any strike-related activities on our campus will unfold in a safe and positive manner.</p>
<p>Given that the strike falls on the first day of Tuesday instruction, I have encouraged faculty to communicate via email with students.</p>
<p>Staff members are asked to check in with supervisors and managers ahead of this day. And it is imperative that students, staff, and faculty monitor developments throughout the strike day.</p>
<p>As a manager, supervisor, or employee, if you have questions about the strike or the impact of the strike on your working environment or your employees, please contact your <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/elr-staff-directory.html">Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst</a>.</p>
<p>Toward that end, we will be activating a number of communication channels that will enable members of the campus community to stay informed about any operational impacts caused by strike activities on January 10.</p>
<p>Before coming to campus on Tuesday, please check a <a href="planned-strike/index.xml">special web page</a>, where the Public Affairs Office will post information and updates. The campus's communication hotline (459-INFO) will be activated early in the morning on January 10, and KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) will broadcast news and information on an as-needed basis. We will also share information via UCSC's <a href="https://twitter.com/ucsc">Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you haven't done so already, please make sure your contact information is current in <a href="http://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/">CruzAlert</a>, the campus's phone-based emergency notification system.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your cooperation and patience.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="749b738b8072701752a34ca3fb5124a2"><name>hackathon</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz will host annual hackathon January 20 to 22</title><summary>Hack UCSC 2017 will draw software developers, designers, and entrepreneurs for a coding marathon.</summary><keywords>Hack UCSC, hackathon</keywords><start-date>1483689600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz will host annual hackathon January 20 to 22</display-name><path>/2017/01/hackathon</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/hackathon</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1483720060535</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483720515485</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/hack-ucsc-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/hack-ucsc-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hack-ucsc-410.jpg</name><display-name>hack-ucsc-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>111816</file-size><width>410</width><height>312</height></image><image-alt>hackathon poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/hack-ucsc-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/hack-ucsc-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hack-ucsc-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hack-ucsc-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20645</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>hackathon poster image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Since its founding in 2013, Hack UCSC has grown into one of the largest hackathons in California.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Hack UCSC 2017 will draw software developers, designers, and entrepreneurs for a coding marathon</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will host its fourth annual hackathon, <a href="http://www.hackucsc.com/">Hack UCSC 2017</a>, from January 20 to 22 at Porter College. Participation is free, and more than 1,000 students have already applied, so organizers are expecting this year's event to be the biggest yet.</p>
<p>Hack UCSC is a non-profit, student-run annual hackathon event aimed at college and high school students interested in technology development. Teams can be formed in advance or at the event, where they will work to create apps and programs that provide innovative solutions to a range of social and business issues. The event provides opportunities to connect with tech industry luminaries, learn new skills, and win prizes in a variety of categories.</p>
<p>Hack UCSC 2017 kicks off on Friday, January 20, at 9 p.m. with talks by UCSC alumnus and entrepreneur Tomer Kagan and pioneering computer scientist Ken Thompson. Thompson, the keynote speaker, is best known as co-inventor of the UNIX operating system, and he also invented the precursor to the C programming language. Kagan is the cofounder of search service Quixey and of the resume platform Sigma, a major sponsor of the hackathon.</p>
<p>Participants will be competing for prizes in two main categories: Innovation (judged on novelty, technical merit, commercial practicality, and design) and Tech Cares (judged on how the solution solves social and environmental issues, commercial practicality, and design). In addition, sponsored prizes will be awarded in a variety of categories, including best mobile app (sponsored by Pyze), best project by a UCSC graduate student (sponsored by the UCSC Division of Graduate Studies), best use of the Sigma platform (sponsored by Sigma), best use of the Microsoft API (sponsored by Microsoft), best use of the App Engine API (sponsored by Google), and more.</p>
<p>At the closing ceremony on Sunday, January 22, the speakers will be UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal and Bud Colligan, co-chair of the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership and founder and CEO of South Swell Ventures.</p>
<p>The sponsors of this event include Sigma, South Swell Ventures, UC Santa Cruz Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED), UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering (BSOE), Santa Cruz Economic Development, Santa Cruz New Tech Meetup, QualComm, Microsoft, Google, ProductOps, UC Santa Cruz Arts Division, GitHub, UC Santa Cruz Center for Information Technology in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), Looker, the UC Santa Cruz Student Union Assembly (SUA), Green Visor Capital, Brereton Law Office, Santa Cruz Works, the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County, Santa Cruz Tech Beat, Red Bull, Soylent, Pacific Cookie Company, Pyze, The Sandwich Spot, and Chipotle.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.hackucsc.com/</url><title>HACK UCSC 2017</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://cied.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Center for Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurial Development</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="75596f1f8072701752a34ca3442f8813"><name>bas-institute</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>BAS Institute offers staff insight into campus processes, policies</title><summary>Business and Administrative Services (BAS) next month will roll out a new program designed to help staff navigate the multitude of processes and policies in the areas of Travel &amp; Entertainment, Compensation, Recruitment &amp; Talent Acquisition, and Procurement.&#13;

<p>Staff interested in attending one or more of the sessions can learn more and <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemDyDvQLbPFfeOi10AeJDlBppSRsJLU-s_pitzRTM5MUwJcw/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">register online</a>. For planning purposes, staff are asked to register by January 24.</p>
<p>The BAS Institute will provide staff with an opportunity to learn more about each area and engage with colleagues to discuss best practices. Participants will gain a broader understanding of how various BAS processes intersect with each other and how UC policy frames campus processes.</p>
<p>The goal is to ensure departments across campus who rely on BAS processes are equipped with the information and tools needed to be successful. Institute sessions are geared toward anyone seeking to understand BAS business processes and are intended for employees ranging from managers to front-line staff.&#160; &#160;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="756000cf8072701752a34ca3acfe070c"><name>ehs-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal review/campus community comment for the Environmental, Health &amp; Safety Policy</title><summary>The purpose of the policy is to establish a baseline of minimum standard for all University of California locations and ensure compliance with all applicable health, safety, and environmental regulations. &#13;

As it applies to the university, it prohibits state funds from being used to pay for travel to a state that authorizes discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression; or voids or repeals existing state or local protections against such discrimination. State funds include any UCSC fund code in the 19900&#8211;19999 range.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, the states of Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee are on the prohibited travel list maintained on the California State Attorney General Office's <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887">AB 1887 webpage</a>. The webpage also outlines the exceptions under which state funds may be used to pay for travel to states on the prohibited travel list. Please be aware that non-state funds can be used to pay for travel to these states.</p>
<p>The law also prohibits UC from requiring employees to travel to the states on the Attorney General&#8217;s list, regardless of funding source. An employee may therefore decline to travel to one of the identified states, unless one of the statutory exceptions applies.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="760ef0bd8072701752a34ca3bd6d1eb6"><name>winter-storm</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Powerful winter storm expected this weekend</title><summary>The National Weather Service is predicting that more than a foot of rain could fall in the region, with mountain communities being the most susceptible to storm impacts.</summary><keywords>winter, storm, preparedness</keywords><start-date>1483743600000</start-date><display-name>Winter storm</display-name><path>/2017/01/winter-storm</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/winter-storm</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1483744406415</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483744406415</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Officials from Santa Cruz County, the City of Santa Cruz, and UC Santa Cruz Office of Emergency Services are urging residents to use caution when traveling around the region, as a powerful winter storm is expected to impact the area over the weekend.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service is predicting that more than a foot of rain could fall in the region, with mountain communities being the most susceptible to storm impacts. Less rainfall, though still significant, is expected throughout the county. Residents are advised to take appropriate precautions if living or traveling through areas prone to flooding.</p>
<p>Those who live in the greater Santa Cruz area, or those who plan to travel both on and off campus should expect wet roadways. Drive with extreme caution and plan extra time for travel.</p>
<p>Due to the likelihood of mudslides and falling trees, residents are also advised to avoid wooded areas such as heavily forested parks. Santa Cruz County maintains several storm resources for residents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storm Preparedness website: <a href="http://santacruzcounty.us/StormPreparedness.aspx">http://santacruzcounty.us/StormPreparedness.aspx</a></li>
<li>County Office of Emergency Services: <a href="http://www.santacruzcounty.us/OES">http://www.santacruzcounty.us/OES</a></li>
<li>Sandbag pickup locations: <a href="http://www.santacruzcounty.us/sandbags">http://www.santacruzcounty.us/sandbags</a></li>
<li>Current road closures (Santa Cruz County roads only): <a href="http://www.sccroadclosure.org">http://www.sccroadclosure.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, residents may look up current PG&amp;E power outages at http://www.pge.com/outages, or call their 24-hour hotline at 800-743-5002.</p>
<p>Additional consideration should be given to coastal hazards and strong tides as a result of the storm system. Remember to &#8220;never turn your back&#8221; to the ocean, as sneaker waves can potentially cause you to lose your footing and the strong tides can pull you into the water.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7619fa3f8072701752a34ca3b2a8dde2"><name>blumenthal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Looking ahead</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal looks ahead to what's in store for UC Santa Cruz in 2017.</summary><keywords>blumenthal, new year, campaign, carson, breakthrough, noller</keywords><description>2017</description><start-date>1483603200000</start-date><display-name>2017</display-name><path>/2017/01/blumenthal</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/blumenthal</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1483745129690</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483745223260</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Happy New Year! 2017 promises to be a year unlike any other, and I wish you the best as we forge ahead, each of us finding our voice and engaging in the world around us.<br/>
 <br/>
 On campus, we are poised to build on the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/year-in-review-feature-2016.html">great successes</a> we celebrated last year, including the naming of Rachel Carson College, Harry Noller's Breakthrough Prize, and a banner year in fundraising. We will name more faculty to endowed chairs and review a record number of undergraduate applications to select the best-qualified, most diverse Class of 2017. New academic programs will serve students, and new outreach programs will build our connections locally and in Silicon Valley. <br/>
 <br/>
 This year will also usher in changes in campus leadership. I look forward to sharing good news shortly about the recruitment of a campus provost/executive vice chancellor, and I want to again thank Herbie Lee for serving on an interim basis. We are recruiting a new dean of the Social Sciences Division and a new vice chancellor for Information Technology Services. Later this week, we will welcome a new campus diversity officer for staff and students, and a new campus counsel will be announced shortly. <br/>
 <br/>
 One thing won't change. As you look around campus, you'll notice new banners that celebrate our "rich tradition of nontraditional thinking." This signage, featuring faculty across the disciplines, is a tribute to the culture of innovation that supports daring exploration, scholarship, and creative expression at UC Santa Cruz. This hallmark of the UCSC experience is more important than ever.<br/>
 <br/>
 There will be more good news, including an update on The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, but for now, welcome back to the most beautiful university in the world. Don't forget to take a moment to appreciate the redwoods, the meadows, and our stunning views of Monterey Bay. <br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7634b21e8072701752a34ca3167f97b8"><name>rockefeller-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Santa Cruz receives $450,000 grant to study economic inclusivity in emerging countries </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz will test and refine the foundation’s emerging inclusive economies framework in geographic contexts and markets.</summary><keywords>inclusive, economy, rockefeller</keywords><start-date>1483743600000</start-date><display-name>Economies</display-name><path>/2017/01/rockefeller-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/rockefeller-grant</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1483746880655</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483988124362</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/Benner_Chris-300.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/Benner_Chris-300.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>Benner_Chris-300.jpeg</name><display-name>Benner_Chris-300.jpeg</display-name><file-size>111618</file-size><width>300</width><height>434</height></image><image-alt>Chris Benner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/Benner_Chris-80px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/Benner_Chris-80px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>Benner_Chris-80px.jpeg</name><display-name>Benner_Chris-80px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>12084</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Professor Chris Benner</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Environmental Studies and Sociology professor Chris Benner will lead a team helping to develop the Rockefeller Foundation’s inclusive economies concept</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Rockefeller Foundation awarded UC Santa Cruz a $450,260 grant to test and refine the foundation&#8217;s emerging inclusive economies framework in Brazil, India, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The work will be led by Chris Benner, the Dorothy E. Everett Chair in Global Information and Social Entrepreneurship and director of the Everett Program.</p>
<p>Benner will lead a research team that includes Manuel Pastor, a UCSC alumnus and former UCSC professor who is now with the University of Southern California, and Gordon McGranahan, a research fellow at the Institute for Development Studies at the University of Sussex.</p>
<p>With the award, Benner will continue building on the inclusive economies framework he and Pastor researched in 2016 with funding from a previous Rockefeller Foundation award. These initial findings <a href="http://inclusiveeconomies.org">are available online</a>.</p>
<p>Benner, whose research focuses on the relationships between technological change, regional development, and structures of economic opportunity, and his colleagues plan to conduct research in three major regions of the globe&#8212;Brazil, India, and South Africa&#8212;to better understand the relationships between the different elements of inclusive economies, e.g. equity and growth, participation and stability, stability, and sustainability.</p>
<p>The Rockefeller Foundation defines inclusive economies as ones where there is &#8220;expanded opportunity for more broadly shared prosperity, especially for those facing the greatest barriers to their well-being.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equitable, participatory, growing, stable, and sustainable are the five characteristics that define an inclusive economy. Benner and his colleagues&#8217; initial work broke down these categories into 15 subcategories (e.g, how widespread its technology infrastructure is) and 57 indicators (e.g. percentage of households with internet or number of mobile phone subscribers) that better allow geographies to measure themselves up against the characteristics of an inclusive economy.</p>
<p>In this next phase of work, they plan to refine the initial framework and explore its applicability in both urban and rural contexts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re focusing on Brazil, India, and South Africa because they embody a range of characteristics of levels of urbanization, strength of rural economy, levels of rural-urban migration and total income,&#8221; Benner said, suggesting that the findings will thus be relevant for a much broader array of countries as well.</p>

We are concluding our search for the next CP/EVC, but that is not quite done. In between, I&#8217;m honored to have been asked to fill in as interim CP/EVC.</p>
<p>For the past six years, I&#8217;ve served the campus as vice provost for Academic Affairs and campus diversity officer for faculty. In that role, I&#8217;ve advised the CP/EVC on academic planning, academic resource allocation, and academic personnel, and I&#8217;ve overseen online education, accreditation, the Arboretum, and the development of our new Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning. This insider knowledge of our campus, our policies, and our practices will hopefully be helpful in this new interim role. I am also looking forward to learning new areas and working with more of the great people on our campus.</p>
<p>I am also faculty in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I am an applied Bayesian statistician, and my primary research area is statistical modeling for computer simulations. Examples of my research include helping NASA model rocket boosters and helping hydrologists understand underground water flow. I am discovering that there are large amounts of tables, figures, and budgets that cross the CP/EVC&#8217;s desk, so it is helpful to come from a discipline that studies data.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I am an avid rock climber, although these days I am mostly confined to the climbing gym. I greatly enjoy the puzzle aspect of climbing, where you have to both think about what you are doing, and then physically do it. And I have found that regular physical activity is a good balance to the stresses of the office.</p>
<p>I will only be in this position for a limited amount of time, so my primary goal is to keep the campus running smoothly and to keep campus priorities moving forward. We have a number of things in the planning process, and they need to be progressing or brought to completion. One example is our first-year writing curriculum; our faculty have been working on proposals for revision, and I hope that we can complete that process in the next few months. Another big project that needs to advance is the building of new housing on the west side of campus. We need to continue to improve our retention and graduation rates, and to grow our graduate enrollment. I don&#8217;t plan any major changes in direction, but there is a lot to be done to keep us moving forward.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="84ffa5908072701752a34ca3b0680191"><name>alonso-axel</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Axel Alonso: Diversity’s superhero</title><summary>Alumnus Axel Alonso, editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics, has worked to make comic book characters and their creators reflect our diverse world.&#13;

Her son, Reece, was refusing to go to sleep because he&#8217;d heard that the newest Hulk comic book featured the Korean-American Amadeus Cho and the boy was convinced he might be the next one &#8220;to get the Hulk curse,&#8221; as he called it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Alonso was delighted. Not because his 5-year-old nephew was already a Marvel Comics fan but because Reece, who is Korean-American, could see himself in a superhero in a way he never had with the white Bruce Banner.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that beautiful,&#8221; says Alonso (Cowell &#8217;87, sociology), a former journalist who has been editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics since 2011. For him, that moment was the crystallization of the work he has done to make comic book characters and their creators reflect the diverse world in which we live.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>During his tenure, the 50-year-old Alonso has overseen the creation of a Muslim superhero, a female Thor, and a biracial Spider-Man, along with the Korean-American Hulk that set his nephew&#8217;s imagination flying. He also signed National Book Award winner and MacArthur genius Ta-Nehisi Coates to pen the latest Black Panther series and hired two black female writers, a rarity in the industry.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>All of which has also led to success for Marvel Comics. According to news reports, in 2015, Marvel Comics made $224 million from sales of its comics and trade paperbacks.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Alonso talks at rapid-fire pace, and the enjoyment of a job he describes as being like a show runner for</span> <em>The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, House of Cards,</em> <span>and</span> <em>Modern Family</em> <span>all at the same time is palpable.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He grew up in San Francisco, the son of Mexican and English immigrants. His comic books of choice, he says, were cinematic heroes like The Hulk and Luke Cage&#8212;until basketball and girls cooled his ardor at age 12.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But while working on an Alaskan fishing boat to earn money for college, Alonso stumbled across Alan Moore&#8217;s Swamp Thing, which, he says, &#8220;hit my sweet spot. It was smart and literate and made me go back to see how comics had changed and why.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After a financially unrewarding stint as a journalist, he got a job as a comic book editor. One of his early tasks at Marvel was editing a seven-issue book titled</span> <span>Truth: Red, White &amp; Black,</span> <span>which set off a wash of criticism from those who thought he&#8217;d &#8220;ruined&#8221; the iconic Captain America character.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To Alonso, having a black man be the guinea pig for a U.S. drug experiment during WWII was a lot more likely than having a white guy like Steve Rogers be injected with an untested serum. Just look at the infamous Tuskegee Study, which allowed untreated syphilis to rampage through 600 black sharecroppers, he says.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By the end of the series, critics&#8212;including a prominent reviewer&#8212;had changed their minds. The experience, according to Alonso, only cemented his desire to make sure readers of all races, nationalities, and religions could see themselves in the pages of comic books.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I have mixed-race kids and I want them to see their reflections,&#8221; says Alonso, whose wife is of Korean descent.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To that end, his stable of 23 editors and 120-150 writers includes people of diverse backgrounds, religions, and genders. H</span>e also supervises hundreds of artists from around the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But, just as important as diversity, the 63 to 72 books Marvel Comics puts out each month under Alonso&#8217;s stewardship must be rooted in story and in the real world.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;One of our guiding mantras is that you should reflect the world outside your window,&#8221; Alonso says. &#8220;What are people talking about? What are they worried about? Our stories strive to address these things through allegory and metaphor. We want to speak to the human condition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>That philosophy is why Marvel asked Coates to reboot the Black Panther series, which focuses on T&#8217;Challa, the superhero ruler of the mythical and technologically advanced country of Wakanda in Africa.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Coates&#8217;s Black Panther arc tells the story of revolution, which forces T&#8217;Challa to reassess his form of government, a monarchy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a tract or an essay,&#8221; Alonso says. &#8220;This is an action-adventure narrative that says something about the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Which means, of course, that current times are ripe for a whole new set of storylines and characters, and, for Alonso, that is the biggest challenge of his job: to create exciting and meaningful characters and stories, while at the same time making sure the bottom line is strong.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;The things we do are not just creative risks,&#8221; he says, &#8220;they are also financial risks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-422275cc-84ff-7830-25f5-7f94cf786c3a"><span>So far, Alonso&#8217;s vision is paying off.</span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8518d4ca8072701752a34ca3bb269d68"><name>allies-inclusion</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Access advocate Haben Girma to speak on campus</title><summary>Girma's talk is part of Allies for Inclusion: The Ability Exhibit, a traveling interactive display created to build awareness about people with disabilities. </summary><start-date>1483988400000</start-date><display-name>Inclusion</display-name><path>/2017/01/allies-inclusion</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/allies-inclusion</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1483996712888</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1484155278561</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer Pittman</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/haben-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/haben-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haben-400.jpg</name><display-name>haben-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>129931</file-size><width>400</width><height>283</height></image><image-alt>Haben Girma</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/haben-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/haben-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haben-80.jpg</name><display-name>haben-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>15223</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Haben Girma</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Haben Girma will give a presentation to campus staff from noon to 1 p.m. on Jan. 18 and a talk for the campus community from 4 to 5 p.m. Both are free and open to the public.

<ol>
<li>Use captions on all videos and make sure that you purchase videos with closed or open captions and audio description.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/accessibility/sensusaccess/">Sensus Access</a>, a tool to convert documents found on the UCSC website.</li>
<li>Post course textbook lists early so the Disability Resource Center can cut and scan textbooks into accessible documents for screen readers and text to speech.</li>
<li>Use a microphone when possible so the audience in lecture hall can clearly hear. Avoid sound drop-offs and background noise.</li>
<li>Create presentation slide images and website images with alt tags so screen reader users (people who are blind) can know what others are seeing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional faculty support for accessible course design can be found at the Faculty Instructional Technology Center (FITC), an IT resource for faculty.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Allies for Inclusion: The Ability Exhibit invites visitors to consider new ways of experiencing the world</article-subhead><article-text><p>Internationally acclaimed inclusion advocate Haben Girma, the first deaf-blind person to graduate from Harvard Law School, will be at UC Santa Cruz Wednesday, Jan. 18, to encourage campus discussion about inclusion and access through design and technology.</p>
<p>Girma, who speaks persuasively about the role of technology in opening up the world to people with disabilities, has received awards from two U.S. presidents for her work championing equal access to information for people with disabilities. She has been named on Forbes&#8217; &#8220;30 Under 30&#8221; leadership list and as one of BBC&#8217;s Women of Africa Heroes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re amazingly fortunate to get her here,&#8221; said Ricki Carr, chair of the campus Staff Diversity Group, one of the organizers of the event.</p>
<p>Girma&#8217;s campus presentations will be accompanied by an exhibit, Allies For Inclusion: The Ability Exhibit, a traveling interactive display created by Saint Louis University designed to build awareness about people with disabilities. The three-day exhibit gives visitors an opportunity to experience new ways of being in the world and highlights efforts by the disability movement to change the way people design things.</p>
<p>The greater community is invited to attend Girma&#8217;s talks and visit the exhibit at Kresge Town Hall on campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope there will be a cognitive understanding of things they can do when interacting with people, that they will consider the type of language they use, and help remove the stigma attached to people with varying abilities,&#8221; said Catherine Green, assistant director for Affiliated Residential Community Housing. &#8220;We have an opportunity for continued education, conversations and action regarding social justice and abilities.&#160;It&#8217;s important for people to have empathy without pity.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been significant efforts to improve accessibility through design throughout the UC system. At UCSC, by November of the fall term, 1,578 students had contacted the Disability Resource Center about services and more students have been identified that may be eligible for assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key thing for me is understanding,&#8221; said Rosa Melero, a UCSC senior with dyslexia who is the head intern with the campus <a href="http://drc.ucsc.edu/student-opportunities/ALI/index.html">Accessible Leadership Intern program</a>. &#8220;When I say I can&#8217;t spell, people who understand don&#8217;t say, &#8216;Why can&#8217;t you?&#8217; They say, &#8216;How can I help you?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even more than students, professors and people who have control over the learning environment often have the most impact on student learning, Melero says. &#8220;People who make it less stressful make that class a lot better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question is how do we design differently so we are inclusive of all people?</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t always consider the environment that we design for people and the obstacles it can create,&#8221; says Rick Gubash, UCSC Disability Resource Center director and a co-organizer of the event.</p>
<p>For Girma, who listens to people via a digital braille display machine and explores the internet through content that is tagged with text, technology plays a key role in her ability to participate fully in her work and with society.</p>
<p>On campus, the focus is on all intersections of access. Efforts are underway at the systemwide level to improve the accessibility of UC web content. Some people need captions on videos; others benefit from universal design best practices that involve adding text to digital documents, adding additional testing time in courses or providing a less distracting learning environment. Campus bridges can be smoothed and elevators, modernized. For some people, having a short break in the day between classes makes it impossible to reach a course located across campus.</p>
<p>In student housing, three people to a room is manageable for about 90 percent of the community, but 10 percent might have social-related disabilities such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder or depression and may need a quieter environment. More than 40 percent of the people served by the Disability Resource Center has a psychological disability as a primary disability.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have moved from a medical model of disability&#8212;from the idea that we need to fix someone with a disability&#8212;to a social movement focused on designing environments to accommodate people who need universal access,&#8221; Gubash said. &#8220;We are fixing the access issues that exist, but we&#8217;re hoping to get ahead of that, so we&#8217;re designing accessibility into the way we do things. In the future, I hope we can learn to design differently. We&#8217;re listening to our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beginning this winter quarter, Gubash and Jaye Padgett, interim vice provost for Student Success, are reaching out to faculty departments to discuss how to design future courses with accessibility considerations at the outset. The goal is to eliminate the need for many later accommodations by improving accessibility by design. Contact him to schedule a meeting at <a href="mailto:rgubash@ucsc.edu">rgubash@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

 &#160;<br/>
 <em>Teach! Organize! Resist!</em> is a series of nine workshops and panels designed to build alliances for social justice in anticipation of the presidency of Donald Trump. The all-day teach-in will address topics including economic inequality, LGBTQ resistance, how to talk about climate-change science, how to combat Islamophobia, what to do at a protest, and how students, immigrants, and workers can engage in democracy. <br/>
 <br/>
 The day starts at 10:30 a.m. at Graduate Student Commons and Humanities 2, room 259; it culminates with an evening forum from 4&#8211;6 p.m. at the Music Recital Hall. The teach-in is free and open to the public. A detailed schedule is <a href="http://teachorganizeresist.net/ActionList#ucsc">online</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 For organizers, including Sociology Professor Veronica Terriquez, <em>Teach! Organize! Resist!</em> represents an opportunity to reimagine what is possible. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;A critical mass of people are ready to take action,&#8221; said Terriquez, who will lead a session about the role students can play in enacting social and political change. Panelists will include two UCSC alumni: Shaila Ramos (B.A., Latin American and Latino studies, &#8216;15), a youth organizer at Californians for Justice, and Erica Leyva (B.A., Legal Studies, &#8216;16), an organizer at the Services, Immigrant Rights, and Education Network (SIREN) in San Jose.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Everyday people have transformed the way we think about politics in California,&#8221; said Terriquez, who has 20 years of involvement with grassroots movements in the state. <br/>
 <br/>
 Teach-in organizer Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies, said the day of education and action will be empowering. &#8220;This moment has called for people to come together in community in an unprecedented way, and to remember that we are not powerless when we work together,&#8221; said Falc&#243;n.<br/>
 <br/>
 The UC Santa Cruz event is a response to a call for action issued by UCLA Professor Ananya Roy. Numerous faculty have contributed to <em>Teach! Organize! Resist!</em>, including Lisa Rofel and Chelsea Blackmore in Anthropology, Falc&#243;n in Latin American and Latino studies, Hillary Angelo in Sociology, instructor Chris Gray of Crown College, and UCSC graduate students Jess Whatcott of Politics and Kati Barahona&#8211;Lopez of Sociology.&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/>

Professor Archer joined the UCSC faculty in 1972, and was an expert in verbal and nonverbal communication; violence, war, and peace; social psychology; cross-national research; and crime and law. In addition to being a prolific researcher, an influential scholar, and a beloved teacher, Dane transformed his research and scholarship on nonverbal communication into a successful video series.</p>
<p>In 2008, two awards were created based on the work of Professor Archer. These awards allow undergraduates the opportunity to explore the areas of verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as the areas of violence, war, and peace.</p>

<p>Please reduce your water usage as much as possible until further notice. Ways to cut back include postponing laundry, reducing shower times, and reducing water-intensive activities in labs, offices, and administrative spaces.</p>
<p>City officials tell us they are able to produce only about two-thirds of the normal water supply during this short-term, serious water shortage. The Newell Creek pipeline, which carries water from Loch Lomond Reservoir to the Graham Hill water treatment plant, was shut down Monday after the weekend storm caused a significant leak. Storm-caused turbidity in the San Lorenzo River has impacted other water sources.</p>
<p>Please help spread the word about this water emergency. Authorities hope to have systems working at full capacity within a week. As always, report any leaks to the <a href="https://fixit.sa.ucsc.edu/">fix-it website</a>.</p>

 <br/>
 Hosted by UC Santa Cruz, the event serves as a qualifying regional for the National High School Ethics Bowl, where the winner goes on to compete against other regional winners from around the country.<br/>
 <br/>
 The Ethics Bowl is a collaborative yet competitive event--more nuanced than debate--in which teams are presented with a series of wide-ranging ethical dilemmas, asked to analyze them, and then judged on the basis of their analyses. <br/>
 <br/>
 "In other debate formats, the goal is to convince the judges you're right," notes philosophy lecturer Kyle Robertson, founder and director of the UCSC event. "In Ethics Bowl, the goal is to convince a panel of judges that you've thought well about the cases."<br/>
 <br/>
 The ethical dilemmas used in a high school ethics bowl range from those particularly relevant to young students (questions about cheating, plagiarism, peer pressure, use and abuse of social media, the right to privacy); to political and social issues (free speech, gun control, eco-tourism); and bioethical issues (cloning, parental consent).<br/>
 <br/>
 This year's regional event takes place on campus January 14 at the Humanities Lecture Hall. The 16 cases that will be discussed include ethical questions about birth control and the Affordable Care Act, video games involving virtual and augmented reality, working while sick, online privacy, banning religious garb, and "donor babies."<br/>
 <br/>
 All of the teams participating received their cases and questions in the fall so they could prepare responses with their coaches. The panel of judges includes not only members with philosophy backgrounds, but also businesspeople, politicians, and members of various professions in the community to highlight the fact that ethics is not just an academic subject.<br/>
 <br/>
 The High School Ethics Bowl is one of several events hosted by the <a href="https://publicphilosophy.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Center for Public Philosophy</strong></em></a> at UC Santa Cruz in an effort to foster a more thoughtful and engaged community of thinkers, particularly in the youngest generations. <br/>
 <br/>
 Directed by associate philosophy professor Jonathan Ellis, the aim of the center is to bring philosophy to broader segments of the public, based on the core value that as citizens in a democratic society, it is our civic responsibility to make choices in a well-reasoned and informed way.<br/>
 <br/>
 Other center projects include <em>Philosophy for Children</em>, where faculty and graduate students from UC Santa Cruz bring philosophy to children at local elementary and middle schools, engaging them in sustained discussions of philosophical questions; and <em>Philosophy in Jail</em>, where inmates at local correctional facilities strengthen their skills of reason, deliberation, and communication through supervised discussion of contemporary ethical issues.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I&#8217;m consistently inspired by how this event sparks real conversations,&#8221; said Kirstin Olsen, history department chair at Georgiana Bruce Kirby School in Santa Cruz. &#8220;Listening to the students' discourse actually changed the way I handle such topics as a teacher&#8230;They convinced me, through the force of their argumentation, that I should be thinking about different things in my teaching.&#160; And when your students can teach you something like that&#8230;I can&#8217;t put a price on that.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 High school ethics bowl coach and UC Santa Cruz alumna Breeann MacDonald (Philosophy BA, 2015) is also a strong advocate of the program. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I&#8217;ve seen this light, I see the students go 'wait, I get to decide why it's good, if it's good'&#8230;I think we send a lot of kids out of high school just ready to accept what already is, rather than try to change things,&#8221; said MacDonald.<br/>
 <br/>
 "I am fully convinced High School Ethics Bowl is going to start a revolution in education," MacDonald added. "The buzz word &#8216;critical thinking&#8217; is actually going to start carrying some meaning.&#8221;<br/>

Teresa Maria Linda Scholz joined UC Santa Cruz on January 5.</p>
<p>Scholz, who goes by Linda, comes to Santa Cruz from Eastern Illinois University, where she has been an associate professor in the Communication Studies Department. She earned a Ph.D. in communication from the University of Colorado, Boulder. She also holds master's and bachelor's degrees in speech communication, as well as master's certification in women's studies, from Colorado State University.</p>
<p>In parallel to her academic career, Linda has extensive experience in diversity, using the classroom and her role as a faculty member to push for institutional and social change. She has a certificate in diversity training from StirFry Seminars and Consulting in Berkeley, led by the master diversity trainer Lee Mun Wah. She describes herself as a "critical Latina/Latin American transnational feminist scholar in communication studies." Her depth of experience in diversity and inclusion-related initiatives made her an outstanding candidate for this position.</p>
<p>Linda will oversee diversity and inclusion programming for the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, working closely with her counterpart for faculty, Herbie Lee, who is currently serving as interim campus provost/executive vice chancellor. Linda and Herbie are responsible for providing strategic direction as we build a welcoming and inclusive campus climate that will support all members of the UC Santa Cruz community. We strive for a respectful and nurturing community that is free from bias and harassment.</p>
<p>Diversity and inclusion are core campus values, and I look forward to working with Linda as she engages students, staff, faculty, and campus leaders in this important work. Linda succeeds Sheree Marlowe, who took a post at Clark University.</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming Linda to UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Associate Chancellor Ashish Sahni</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="94e3a0598072701752a34ca3bdd15b7f"><name>career-tracks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Training on upcoming Career Tracks Launch</title><summary>We are writing to notify everyone that the Career Tracks Team and Karen Berardi from Office of the President will host a Town Hall series.</summary><start-date>1484208000000</start-date><display-name>Training on upcoming Career Tracks Launch</display-name><path>/2017/01/career-tracks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/career-tracks</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1484261661201</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1484261742509</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>We are writing to notify everyone that the Career Tracks Team and Karen Berardi from Office of the President will host a Town Hall series.

Students will study the history, purpose, and structure of invented languages. </article-subhead><article-text><p class="normal">In <em>Star Trek</em>, hulking warriors speak Klingon. In <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, ancient forest dwellers talk in Elvish. And in <em>Game of</em> <em>Thrones</em>, nomadic tribes chatter in Dothraki.</p>
<p class="normal">These made-up languages evoke fictional worlds. Now, fans can learn more about the magic behind all those invented words and phrases by immersing themselves in the history of constructed languages.</p>
<p class="normal">Starting this January, the UC Santa Cruz Linguistics Department is offering a course on made-up languages for the first time. <em>Constructed Languages from Elvish to Esperanto</em> will give students a chance to study the history, purpose, and structure of invented languages.</p>
<p class="normal">In the process, students will gain a deeper knowledge of how languages work and insights into how languages can be crafted for different purposes.</p>
<p class="normal">&#160;<strong>UC Santa Cruz connection</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Though this class has never been taught before, it is not UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first connection to invented languages.</p>
<p class="normal">Alumnus Mark Okrand (Stevenson &#8217;70, linguistics) created the Klingon language for several <em>Star Trek</em> movies as well as <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> and <em>Star Trek</em>: <em>Deep Space Nine</em> after studying linguistics as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz. He also holds a graduate degree in linguistics from UC Berkeley.</p>
<p class="normal">Experience making up a language is not required for the course, but it may help.</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;I&#8217;ve met a lot of people who made up a language when they were younger and make their way toward linguistics (because of this),&#8221; says course instructor Nick Kalivoda, a Ph.D. candidate in linguistics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p class="normal">Kalivoda&#8217;s own introduction to linguistics came in high school when he invented a language. He then began learning Esperanto, a constructed language that has more than 2 million speakers.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong>Why make up a language?</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The course will explore the reasons for making up new languages. For some people, it is an enjoyable way to test the limits of communication. For others, made-up languages enhance imaginary worlds.</p>
<p class="normal">As a linguistics student, Klingon inventor Okrand learned concepts that help him design a fictional language for a non-human species. By learning common features of spoken languages, Okrand devised a language with distinctly alien characteristics.</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;Once you have learned a little about natural languages, it gives you a menu of options to pick from when you design the structure of your language,&#8221; Kalivoda explained.</p>
<p class="normal">Language creators can also use this principle to give their language a history. When <em>Lord of the Rings</em> author J.R.R. Tolkien created Elvish, he developed it from an ancient fictional language he had created. In the process, Tolkien established that Elvish had splintered away from this older, made-up language. In doing so, Tolkien added a rich historical context to the world of Middle Earth.</p>
<p class="normal">Some made-up languages can add heft to fantastical creations, but others have more pragmatic uses. L.L. Zamenhof, inventor of Esperanto, wanted it to be an ideal second language for people all over the world; the structure was so simple, anyone could learn it.</p>
<p class="normal">These days, it is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world. Zamenhof came from an ethnically and linguistically diverse region of what is now Poland. Tensions between the residents ran high, in part because they spoke a babble of different languages.</p>
<p class="normal">Hoping to ease these tensions, Zamenhof designed Esperanto to put all the speakers on equal footing. In conversation, no one would have an edge on anyone else because anyone could learn it. Aside from this, Esperanto is politically neutral, a language without a country.</p>
<p class="normal">Though Esperanto is not a natural language, Kalivoda assures that once you start learning it, &#8220;you realize that it&#8217;s just as capable as any natural language of expressing whatever you want to say.&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal">Being an Esperanto speaker, or <em>Esperantist</em>, has come in handy for Kalivoda. When travelling in Iceland one summer he met two friendly travelers, one Italian, the other Slovak, neither of whom spoke much English. The three spoke Esperanto.</p>
<p class="normal">&#8220;I was able to show up in a foreign place and feel right at home.&#8221;</p>
<p class="normal"><em>Linguistics 80K will be offered Winter 2017 and Summer 2017, session two. There are no prerequisites for this course. It satisfies the textual analysis (TA) graduation requirement.</em></p>

On campus and in the county we are seeing high levels of flu.</p>
<p>Your best protection against the flu is to get a flu shot. Students can get a flu shot at the Student Health Center pharmacy or at a pharmacy downtown. Faculty and staff should get their flu shot from their private provider or at an off campus pharmacy.</p>
<p>It is not too late to get a flu shot. This year the flu shot is well matched to circulating flu. This means that the vaccination can prevent or moderate the flu.</p>
<p>Other ways to protect yourself include frequent handwashing and covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze.</p>
<p>Typical flu is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever, body aches, headache and mild cold symptoms like a dry cough or runny nose. The fever can be quite high. You can read more about the flu at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/index.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/index.htm</a></p>
<p>If you have fever over 99.9 F, you should isolate yourself. This means staying in your home until you have gone twenty-four hours without fever without using Tylenol or Ibuprofen. Students can use the Buddy Meal system to get food from the dining hall if you are living on campus.</p>
<p>Send your professors an email explaining that you have isolated yourself for the health of the community. By ruling of the Academic Senate your professors should not require a written excuse for missed classes. It is always best to inform your professor of any absence using email.</p>
<p>Treat your fever with acetaminophen (Tylenol), 325mg, two every 4 to 6 hours or Ibuprofen, 200mg, two every six to eight hours. Get plenty of fluids, lots of rest and don&#8217;t forget to eat.</p>
<p>Fever from flu typically lasts 3 to 7 days. If you have more than 3 days of fever, feel particularly ill, confused, or have difficulty breathing, you should be evaluated at the Student Health Center or another medical facility.</p>
<p>There is a day of recovery for every day of flu. Expect to tire more easily in the week following the fever and to have a dry cough. A cough which makes you short of breath is a concern. It is also a concern if your fever goes away and comes back. If you have these symptoms, seek medical consultation.</p>
<p>The Student Health Center is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 to 4:30. It is open to any registered student. You can call our Advice Nurse for information at 831-459-2591.

bringing research innovations to the marketplace</article-subhead><article-text><p>With $2.2 million in state funding to expand its innovation and entrepreneurship efforts, UC Santa Cruz will launch a multi-faceted support program to help bring research innovations to the marketplace and spur economic development in the Santa Cruz area.</p>
<p>The Support Program for Long-term Innovation, Commercialization &amp; Entrepreneurship (SPLICE) will include an incubator and an accelerator for start-up companies in Santa Cruz, a Silicon Valley incubator, an entrepreneurial training program for students, an internship program for arts students, and commercialization grants.</p>
<p>"We pulled together expertise from across the campus and the surrounding community to create a program that will provide experiential learning for students and support for entrepreneurs at different stages in the innovation cycle," said Mohamed Abousalem, assistant vice chancellor for research, industry alliances and technology commercialization. "The diversity of the activities in our program is unique. This is not a standard innovation and entrepreneurship program."</p>
<p>Several major components of SPLICE are focused on getting startup companies off the ground. The Startup Sandbox Incubator will provide wet-lab and office space, as well as training and mentoring, with a focus on the areas of biotechnology, health science, and agricultural technology. Ann Pace, senior director of research development for the UCSC <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a> and co-leader of the incubator, said it will fill an unmet need of campus researchers for space where they can start companies.</p>
<p>"We get requests for this type of thing regularly," she said. "There are incubators in the Bay Area that are oversubscribed, with wait lists. We know people want to live and work in Santa Cruz, so it seems like a great fit."</p>
<p>Pace said the campus is looking at available spaces on the West Side of Santa Cruz to house the incubator. Also to be located on the West Side is Santa Cruz Accelerates, an accelerator led by local nonprofit <a href="http://www.santacruzworks.org/">Santa Cruz Works</a>. Heather Putnam, executive director of Santa Cruz Works, explained that, while the incubator will serve companies in the early stages of product development, the accelerator will serve those that have a product and need help building their company and securing more funding.</p>
<p>"We have so much talent coming out of the university and already here in Santa Cruz, but if they don't get the support they need in terms of mentoring and funding, they leave, and that means we lose opportunities for job creation," Putnam said. "There are a lot of opportunities here, and the funding for this program came along at just the right time."</p>
<p><strong>AB-2664</strong></p>
<p>Each of UC's 10 campuses is receiving $2.2 million in one-time state funding to further innovation and entrepreneurship efforts as a result of Assembly Bill 2664, signed last fall by Gov. Brown. Each campus must provide matching funds from private sources. According to Abousalem, UC Santa Cruz has already secured interest and commitments from outside sources for more than $2.5 million to support SPLICE activities.</p>
<p>"For us as a smaller campus, this funding will enable us to have a significant impact, bringing more innovations from the research lab to the marketplace and supporting new ventures that will create jobs and promote economic growth in the community," Abousalem said.</p>
<p>With a focus on inclusion, SPLICE aims to increase the participation of students and entrepreneurs from underprivileged and underserved communities. In addition, parts of the program are specifically designed to encourage the involvement of students in the arts and humanities, such as an internship and training program led by arts dean Susan Solt (the Internship for Creative Entrepreneurship) and a broad-based IDEA Hub led by UCSC's <a href="http://cied.ucsc.edu/">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development</a> (CIED).</p>
<p>"Innovation and entrepreneurship programs have typically focused on engineering students, but the problems they address and the solutions they come up with tend to be narrowly focused," said CIED director Sue Carter. "We want to also engage students in the social sciences, arts, and humanities who have different experiences to work with engineers and communities to bring a new set of ideas for problems we should be solving."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Silicon Valley</strong></p>
<p>SPLICE also includes a Silicon Valley Startup Incubator (SVLink) based at the UCSC <a href="http://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu/">Silicon Valley Campus</a>. Led by Tedd Siegel, assistant vice chancellor for research, strategic initiatives, SVLink will partner with multi-campus organizations such as <a href="http://citris-uc.org/">CITRIS</a> and <a href="http://qb3.org/">QB3</a> to offer selected startups office space and related infrastructure, networking opportunities, mentoring, and other services.</p>
<p>The Launchpad component of SPLICE, led by the Office of Research, will offer competitive grants of $5,000 to $15,000 to UCSC entrepreneurs with innovative technology product ideas. This will be overseen by a new position in the Office of Research for a commercialization officer, who will serve as the primary contact for members of the campus community who want to take advantage of the new opportunities and services available through SPLICE.</p>
<p>Additional information about the SPLICE program will be made available on the Office of Research web site at <a href="http://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu">officeofresearch.ucsc.edu</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/ab-2664-funds-spur-innovation-entrepreneurship</url><title>UC Press Release</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aeeb2e5b8072701752a34ca344448fb9"><name>casfs-barn</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cowell Ranch Hay Barn wins architectural awards</title><summary>The Cowell Ranch Hay Barn has won two architectural awards: a 2016 Excellence in Design Honor Award from American Institute of Architects Montana, and the 2017 U.S. WoodWorks Regional Excellence Award from the Wood Products Council. &#13;

 <br/>
 The 150-year-old Hay Barn reopened in September 2015 following an extensive renovation funded by a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/03/hay-barn.html">gift</a> from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation. Construction techniques from the 1860s were used to tie together the superstructure, including mortise and tenon joinery. The project used a combination of new timbers and wood salvaged from the original barn, which was carefully dismantled prior to reconstruction. The new barn was engineered and built to meet modern safety and environmental concerns. The building now houses the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, hosts high-profile campus events and programs, and is available as a <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/about/hay-barn-rental.html">rental facility</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 Architect Richard Fernau of <a href="http://www.fernauhartman.com/">Fernau &amp; Hartman Architects, Inc.</a>, in Berkeley, led the project. A UC Santa Cruz graduate (B.A., philosophy, '69), Fernau was thrilled when he got the job, the biggest challenge of which was "the reinvention of something completely new that preserves the mystique of the old." <br/>
 <br/>
 The AIA Montana award noted the "exhaustive documentation, piece-by-piece deconstruction, painstaking reassembly of the historic structure by weaving together new and old elements, and the incorporation of contemporary program. As home to one of the university&#8217;s most progressive programs, the Hay Barn is both an emblem of the campus&#8217; origins and a reassertion of its commitment to innovation."<br/>
 <br/>
 The WoodWorks Wood Design Award adds to the attention the Hay Barn is receiving. The project will be showcased on the WoodWorks online <a href="http://www.woodworks.org/project-gallery/">gallery</a><br/>
 later this month, featured in a video for trade shows, and included in a forthcoming book, &#8220;Celebrating Excellence in Wood Architecture 2016-2017."<br/>

I know our colleagues in units impacted by this decision will appreciate your patience and cooperation as they adjust to these changes.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b3a9575e8072701752a34ca39647f817"><name>flora-unveiled</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book explores why the discovery of sex in plants took so long</title><summary>The scandalous idea of sexual reproduction in plants was hotly debated for 150 years before finally gaining acceptance in the 19th century.</summary><keywords>Lincoln Taiz, Lee Taiz, Flora Unveiled, sex lives of plants, plant sex</keywords><start-date>1484841600000</start-date><display-name>New book explores why the discovery of sex in plants took so long</display-name><path>/2017/01/flora-unveiled</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/flora-unveiled</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1484777935398</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1514742383307</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Publications</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/cover-flora-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/cover-flora-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-flora-400.jpg</name><display-name>cover-flora-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>185093</file-size><width>400</width><height>607</height></image><image-alt>book cover, Boticelli's Primavera</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/cover-flora-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/cover-flora-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-flora-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-flora-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21953</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>book cover detail</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/lee-linc-taiz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/lee-linc-taiz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lee-linc-taiz-350.jpg</name><display-name>lee-linc-taiz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>87490</file-size><width>350</width><height>343</height></image><image-alt>Lee Taiz and Lincoln Taiz</image-alt><image-caption><p>Lee and Lincoln Taiz at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>The scandalous idea of sexual reproduction in plants was hotly debated for 150 years before finally gaining acceptance in the 19th century</article-subhead><article-text><p>Sexual reproduction in animals has been recognized since ancient times and used in the breeding of domesticated animals for more than 10,000 years. Humans have depended on domesticated crops for just as long, but for most of that time there was no intentional breeding of crop plants because people didn't think plants had sex.</p>
<p>Why did it take so long to discover the existence of two sexes in plants? For more than 20 years, this question has preoccupied botanist Lincoln Taiz, a professor emeritus of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, and his wife Lee Taiz, who worked in his lab as a research biologist.</p>
<p>Their new book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/flora-unveiled-9780190490263?lang=en&amp;cc=af"><em>Flora Unveiled: The Discovery and Denial of Sex in Plants</em></a> (Oxford University Press, 2017), offers a deep history of perceptions about plant gender and sexuality, from the Paleolithic to the 19th century. The book presents compelling evidence of a longstanding gender bias in the perception of plants as female, preventing the discovery of two sexes in plants until the late 17th century and causing the new "sexual theory" to remain controversial for another 150 years.</p>
<p>The authors trace the origins of this gender bias to women's roles as gatherers, crop domesticators, and the first farmers. In ancient myths and religions, female deities were strongly identified with flowers, trees, and agricultural abundance. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, this tradition was assimilated into Christianity in the person of Mary, who was associated with lilies and other flowers.</p>
<p>"The association of lilies with the Virgin Mary was so strong, it was very hard for people to accept the existence of male structures in the lily flower," said Lincoln Taiz, who for many years taught a popular course at UCSC called "The Secret Sex Lives of Plants."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Plant pornography</strong></p>
<p>The English physician Nehemiah Grew first proposed a sexual theory of plant reproduction in 1684, and the ensuing debate eventually caught the attention of British satirists. "Once the wags got ahold of it, their almost pornographic descriptions of what goes on in flowers outraged pious people and polarized the debate even further," said Lincoln Taiz.</p>
<p>It took the careful observations and insights of German botanist Wilhelm Hofmeister, published in 1851, to resolve the controversy by showing that sexual reproduction is a universal feature of plant life cycles, from mosses and ferns to flowering plants.</p>
<p>The clues were there all along. The practice of artificially pollinating date palms began in the Bronze Age, yet the sexual role of pollen went unrecognized for millennia. The story told in <em>Flora Unveiled</em> is a remarkable example of how strongly cultural biases can influence our perceptions, impede scientific advances, and delay the acceptance of new discoveries.</p>
<p>"That something as basic as sex in plants could have remained hidden for so long, and then opposed when it finally was described, shows just how powerful cultural biases can be," said Lincoln Taiz.</p>
<p>Lee Taiz noted that cultural biases influence some of the most important issues facing our society today, from race relations to climate change. "It's important for people to recognize the dynamic between culture and perception that converges in our beliefs," she said. "Our world would be a happier place if more people were aware of how much our belief systems depend on cultural influences."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be6834928072701752a34ca3c5eaffd5"><name>greenwharf</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>City, university wharf partnership earns Silicon Valley award</title><summary>The GreenWharf is a suite of collaborative projects that together minimize the footprint of wharf operations on the surrounding environment while enhancing its appeal as a visitor destination.</summary><keywords>sustainable, greenwharf, city, partnership,</keywords><start-date>1484956800000</start-date><display-name>Sustainability</display-name><path>/2017/01/greenwharf</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/greenwharf</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1484958215882</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1484959157388</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Technology and Information Management</value><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/greenwharf.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/greenwharf.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>greenwharf.jpg</name><display-name>greenwharf.jpg</display-name><file-size>8370</file-size><width>250</width><height>188</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Along with solar photovoltaic panels, this wind turbine charges the batteries of the whart's electric maintenance vehicle.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The GreenWharf Initiative, a partnership between the City of Santa Cruz and UC Santa Cruz, earned recognition from the Silicon Valley Leadership Group.</p>

events</article-subhead><article-text><p class="Default">UC Santa Cruz has established an endowed chair to honor the person most responsible for the thriving Jewish Studies program that exists on the campus today.</p>
<p class="Default">Over 150 donors have committed a combined total of $977,130 to establish the new <strong>Murray Baumgarten Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies</strong> in the Center for Jewish Studies, located in the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Humanities Research. &#160;</p>
<p class="Default">The purpose of the chair is to promote research, teaching, and public outreach activities in the area of Jewish Studies.</p>
<p class="Default">"Murray Baumgarten is truly one of the finest, most decent people I've ever known," noted UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p class="Default">"Wherever he goes, Murray builds community. He nurtured the Jewish Studies program, helped launch our Jewish Studies major, and teamed up with Peter Kenez to teach a legendary class about the Holocaust, the online version of which has reached more than 20,000 people in 60 countries. Murray is a campus treasure."</p>
<p><strong>Nathaniel Deutsch</strong>, director of the Center for Jewish Studies, was honored as the inaugural chair holder at an investiture ceremony held yesterday on campus at College Nine and Ten.</p>
<p>A professor of history, Deutsch is also director of the Institute for Humanities Research at UC Santa Cruz and the chair of the University of California Consortium of Humanities Centers.</p>
<p>"Murray has been a mentor, teacher, and friend to me,&#8221; said Deutsch.&#160;&#8220;I am tremendously honored and humbled to be the first holder of the Baumgarten Chair in Jewish Studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that so many people&#8212;former students, community members, and others whose lives Murray has touched over the years&#8212;contributed to the Baumgarten Chair speaks to the tremendous impact that he has had, and through his legacy, will continue to have at the university," Deutsch added.</p>
<p><strong>Now a distinguished professor emeritus</strong> of English and comparative literature at UC Santa Cruz, Baumgarten was born on a boat traveling from Europe to Panama on the eve of World War II.</p>
<p>In an essay titled &#8220;My Panama,&#8221; he recalled the circumstances of his birth:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that it was any of my doing: running from the Nazis, we were penniless, frightened, wearing out. In the terror of flight, and confusion, I came early from my mother&#8217;s womb, popping out on the ship that was taking us to Panama. Was it a premonition that mine was not to be the ease of a citizen relaxed in the amniotic fluid of home?&#8221;</p>
<p>After spending time in the refugee Jewish community of Colon, Panama, Baumgarten immigrated to America, where he earned degrees from Columbia University and UC Berkeley before coming to the newly created UC Santa Cruz in 1967.</p>
<p>Hired as a scholar of 19th century British literature, he helped co-found the world renowned Dickens Project.&#160;</p>
<p>Although the new university did not have a program in Jewish Studies, Baumgarten and a few colleagues decided to create courses in Jewish history and culture to fill the void. Eventually, with the help of a grant from the Helen Diller Family Foundation, Baumgarten founded the Jewish Studies program and created an undergraduate major.</p>
<p>"Jewish culture has responded to--and been shaped by--interactions with the major cultural, political, and social movements since ancient times, and has had a role in shaping them," Baumgarten observed after UC Santa Cruz approved the major.</p>
<p>"Our program builds bridges between Jewish culture and the many other cultures that exist in today's world, and illuminates what it takes to navigate in a diverse world," he added.</p>

<p>This question is the subject of environmental studies professor Flora Lu&#8217;s new book <a href="http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137564627"><em>Oil, Revolution, and Indigenous Citizenship in Ecuadorian Amazonia</em></a> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017). Co-authors are UC Santa Cruz alumnus N&#233;stor L. Silva (Merrill &#8217;13, Latin American and Latino studies), now a doctoral candidate in anthropology at Stanford University, and Gabriela Valdivia, an associate professor in geography at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>For more than 20 years, Lu has travelled deep into the Ecuadorian Amazon to study the Waorani, an indigenous population living in a region renowned for its ecological diversity. Waorani territory is also the last frontier of the Ecuadorian oil industry.</p>
<p>The intersections of oil and the complex politics of contemporary indigenous people are important issues in Latin America and in today&#8217;s U.S.</p>
<p>Until the late 1950s, the Waorani subsisted from the Amazonian rain forest and experienced limited, often hostile, encounters with outsiders. As Lu shows, their lives changed dramatically when the oil industry expanded into their territory.</p>
<h3>Social and economic transformations</h3>
<p>The Waorani have been mythicized, criminalized, and as Lu argues, marginalized.</p>
<p>The history of their sustained interaction with the remainder of Ecuadorian society, including the state, is characterized by a complex give and take between institutions and the Waorani people.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late 1960s, oil companies began funding infrastructure projects in Waorani villages, including roads, residential complexes, schools, and health clinics. These efforts pushed some indigenous groups deeper into the rainforest and others into contact with the remainder of Ecuadorian society as ecological and economic changes made forest-based subsistence less viable. Today, current president Rafael Correa has sought to use oil wealth to implement a new type of nationalism that promotes his agenda of &#8220;21st Century Socialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>But with traditional subsistence practices altered, Waorani are left with little choice but to engage with the market economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the mid 1990s, my collaborators and I have been tracing the trajectory of &#8216;crude entanglements&#8217; between the Waorani, the state, and oil companies, both multinational and state owned,&#8221; says Lu of the complicated transformations she&#8217;s witnessed in the region. &#8220;By framing these changes as entanglements, we try to cultivate an understanding of the politics of oil and indigeneity that moves beyond the dualism of domination and resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urbanization and economic growth have catalyzed widespread change in Waorani society. They now cope not only with environmental problems such as polluted air and loud noise, but social problems as well. Waorani women often face sexual harassment from oil workers and Waorani communities as a whole deal with alcoholism, domestic violence, and suicide&#8212;issues that had never been present before in their culture.</p>
<h3>At odds with the state</h3>
<p>The Waorani are known for being fiercely protective of their homeland.</p>
<p>When they need attention from oil companies, some Waorani build roadblocks they guard with six-foot spears. President Correa has gone as far as to brand the Waorani as &#8220;terrorists&#8221; for their politics and actions. The Waorani who are particularly precarious are those who refuse to assimilate into the dominant society, called people in voluntary isolation (PVI). Violence has ensued between PVI, settled Waorani, and members of extractive industries.</p>
<p>Lu points out that such violence is entangled with the oil industry. &#8220;The bloodshed reflects a long chain of omissions, injustices, and ineptitudes that have resulted in a glaring lack of recognition and defense of people in voluntary isolation,&#8221; she writes.</p>
<p>The state has dismissed and sometimes ignored these fatal encounters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The killings of indigenous people in isolation have gone largely unaddressed and unmitigated by the Ecuadorian state, exposing the failures of protecting arguably its most vulnerable population&#8212;one for whom the concept of citizenship is highly complicated&#8212;when said protection could mean foregoing exploitation in areas rich in natural resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Lu argues that &#8220;the fact that oil development has and continues to impinge on [their] territories suggests that in reality so-called PVIs in Ecuador do not live in isolated life.&#8221;</p>
<p>PVI are reduced to smaller and smaller patches of forest, rendering their efforts to live as their ancestors did increasingly difficult. Meanwhile, the settled Waorani who live in residential compounds located close to oil infrastructure often have limited access to potable water or toilets, electricity, and health care.</p>
<p>More broadly, the book explores new state/society relations, new forms of citizenship, and the continuing contradictions in contemporary Ecuador between the discourse and realities of President Correa&#8217;s so-called &#8220;Citizen&#8217;s Revolution.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cd7007bd8072701752a34ca361c4b7b3"><name>campus-counsel1</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Appointment of chief campus counsel</title><summary>Our new campus counsel,Lorena Peñaloza, will be starting on campus March 1.</summary><start-date>1485158400000</start-date><display-name>Appointment of chief campus counsel</display-name><path>/2017/01/campus-counsel1</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/campus-counsel1</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1485210386706</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1485210386706</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am delighted to announce the appointment of Lorena Pe&#241;aloza as chief campus counsel.</p>
 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 

 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p>Lorena's impressive background includes experience in public higher education, as well as city and federal government.</p>
 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 

 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p>Lorena joins us from the California State University system's Office of General Counsel, where she has worked since 2008, most recently as University Counsel for Sonoma State University and Humboldt State University. She previously served on the office's litigation team, where she handled a variety of systemwide and campus-based matters in state and federal courts. She also served as a resource attorney on matters including residency, police, and student discipline.</p>
 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p>Prior to joining CSU, Lorena was an assistant city attorney for the City of Santa Ana. She began her legal career with the Social Security Administration&#8217;s Office of the General Counsel in Maryland. She worked in various federal departments, including the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, and served two years in the administration's Office of General Law, litigating employment law matters before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p>Lorena earned her B.A. in sociology and political economies of industrial societies from the University of California, Berkeley, and her J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.</p>

 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p>Lorena succeeds Michael Troncoso, who joined the UC Office of the President last April. I want to thank Associate Campus Counsel Liv Hassett for the excellent support she provided as interim chief campus counsel during the recruitment.</p>

 <span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span> 
<p>Lorena's first day on campus will be March 1.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cd73d1d78072701752a34ca3dc19155a"><name>power-optomization</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on power optimization</title><summary>Physical Planning and Construction is in the midst of a cogen optimization project that will provide uninterrupted power to buildings on Science Hill, even when PG&amp;E's service cuts out.</summary><start-date>1485158400000</start-date><display-name>Update on power optimization</display-name><path>/2017/01/power-optomization</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/power-optomization</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1485210635379</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1485210729078</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>As many of you recall, UC Santa Cruz experienced an extended power outage on January 4 that began at about 9:30 a.m. and lasted until about 5 p.m. The outage, caused by a downed PG&amp;E utility line off campus, was the longest one we've had in several years.<br/>
<br/>
A second outage, again on a PG&amp;E line, briefly left the campus without power in the early hours of January 5.<br/>
<br/>
In both situations, every effort was made to restore power as quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
During the outages, the campus's Cogeneration Plant failed to restart to provide emergency power to Science Hill. Working with the vendor, we believe we've identified the issues that caused the problem with the cogen, though further testing will be required. This will be carefully coordinated with the campus community and scheduled to cause the least amount of disruption.<br/>
<br/>
We also identified an aging power line on Science Hill that will soon be replaced.<br/>
<br/>
The recent outages and the inclement weather that can cause power disruptions underscore the purpose and motivation to complete the Cogeneration Plant Optimization project, set to be finished in September 2017.<br/>
<br/>
During normal operations, the cogen allows us to reduce our reliance on PG&amp;E's power and produces heat that can be used by the campus core buildings. During PG&amp;E outages, it is able to provide power to key campus facilities. However, in the midst of the new cogeneration plant's installation, PG&amp;E put in place operational requirements that did not allow us to use the facility in the original way designed, which was to have a seamless power transition for key campus areas.<br/>
<br/>
To address this gap, Physical Planning and Construction is in the midst of a cogen optimization project that will provide uninterrupted power to buildings on Science Hill, even when PG&amp;E's service cuts out. Last year, we had two planned power outages as part of the optimization project. These outages were undertaken to allow for testing various faults. As a result of these tests, we had seen success, and in recent outages, the new cogen seamlessly picked up power to Science Hill. However, the outage on Jan. 5 exposed other issues.<br/>
<br/>
Staff with Physical Plant found a fault in one of the main campus power lines near the Natural Sciences 2 building, and two of the plant subsystems (the black start generator controls and the heat recovery unit/turbine purge) failed in their start-up sequence. We continue to work toward completing the optimization project. We are also repairing and addressing any operational issues that arise during these utility fault scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
I realize how any outage&#8212;planned or unexpected&#8212;can severely disrupt the important work that happens on our campus. I appreciate your patience as we work toward better power reliability for our campus.<br/>

Construction crews are converting the Science &amp; Engineering Library&#8217;s S.H. Cowell Room into a 99-seat active learning classroom. The classroom, a first of its kind for our campus, is set to open next fall and is a significant first step in a multi-phased renovation for this library.</p>
<p>Much like the rejuvenation of the McHenry Library six years ago, the campus is looking to invest in our Science &amp; Engineering Library so that it can meet the challenges of a larger student body and a campus community living in a digital age.</p>
<p>A reimagined Science &amp; Engineering Library has been a priority in our <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, and fundraising success will be instrumental in moving this project forward. The campus is taking a phased approach so that we can sooner increase study rooms and collaborative workspaces, add a caf&#233;, information commons, and improve the infrastructure and more.</p>
<p>The classroom project highlights the library&#8217;s potential and importance in our academic mission. Nearly three years in the making, it builds on a collaboration between the University Library and the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, and is another example of our campus&#8217;s extraordinary commitment to student learning and academic success.</p>
<p>Research has shown that active learning increases student success in science, engineering, and mathematics, and is often a better approach than large lectures. One <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full.pdf">2014 study showed</a> that &#8220;average examination scores improved by about 6 percent in active learning sections and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>This project got its start two-and-half years ago, after UC Santa Cruz received a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/hhmi-grant.html">$1.5 million grant</a> from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to support an innovative effort to increase the number of students graduating with science degrees.</p>
<p>Already, we have a strong record when it comes to students earning the degree that drew them to UC Santa Cruz. The STEM persistence rate is 57 percent overall&#8212;above the national average of 40 percent&#8212;and 51 percent for underrepresented minority students, well above the national average of 20 percent. Still, we can and should do better.</p>
<p>Another major project where the library has taken the lead for our campus is in the creation of additional study space for our students. With the growth in California resident students on our campus, as well as throughout the system, we have an acute need for additional quiet and group study space for our students. The Science &amp; Engineering Library was able to create a significant amount of study space by consolidating the collection to one focused on the most highly used titles. All titles removed are available to our campus online or via interlibrary loan.</p>
<p>Students have welcomed this additional space. The floor was filled with students&#8212;nearly 700 at one point&#8212;cramming for their final exams.</p>
<p>I encourage faculty interested in learning more about active learning to take part in the lunchtime <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ali/seminars.html">STEM Active Learning Seminar</a>, and to visit our newest classroom when it opens next fall.</p>

<p>"Now I totally know I want to do chemistry," said Escalona, one of 142 high school students (a record number) who did research projects at UC Santa Cruz last summer through the <a href="http://ucsc-sip.org/">Science Internship Program</a> (SIP). Chemistry graduate student Ren&#233; Mercado was Escalona's mentor, and they still keep in touch.</p>
<p>"I had never been to a research lab before," Escalona said. "The Chen lab was pretty amazing. It was a great environment. I gained skills and learned to have confidence in myself."</p>
<p>Escalona plans to major in chemistry at Princeton University, where she will start as a freshman in the fall. When she spoke about her experience in the program at an SIP reunion in December, it was a proud moment for her parents, both Mexican immigrants who had to quit school and start working before they got beyond elementary school.</p>
<p>"Every one of these stories means a lot to me, because it shows the impact the program can have on students' lives and the importance of need-based scholarships for students who could not otherwise afford the program," said Puragra (Raja) GuhaThakurta, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz who started SIP in 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Fundraising effort</strong></p>
<p>GuhaThakurta organized the reunion for SIP alumni and their families to celebrate the program's success and to launch a fundraising effort to provide continued support. Google has been a generous supporter of the program and hosted the reunion at the Google campus in Mountain View. A dozen families of SIP alumni have already committed $120,000 in matching funds to help establish an SIP Annual Fund.</p>
<p>Among other things, the fund will help SIP develop additional enrichment activities, provide more training for mentors, recruit qualified students from low-income communities, provide need-based scholarships, and recruit a full-time program director.</p>
<p>GuhaThakurta said SIP started informally, when he helped a few high school students find computation-based research projects to work on over the summer. He soon discovered that a great many students are interested in such opportunities. The interns work closely with graduate student mentors in faculty research labs, and the program has grown rapidly as GuhaThakurta has gotten more faculty involved.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to encourage other universities to do this, because there's a huge demand. We've found that not only are the students having good experiences, there are also significant benefits for the graduate students who mentor them," GuhaThakurta said.</p>
<p>SIP now involves 15 different departments at UC Santa Cruz, offering students opportunities for summer research projects in areas such as astrophysics, biomolecular engineering, chemistry, linguistics, and environmental science. To date, more than 400 students from 90 different high schools have participated in the 10-week program, which involves a deep dive into a real science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) research project, and also includes workshops, social activities, and field trips.</p>
<p>One hallmark of the program from the start has been the remarkable success rate of interns who submit their research projects to national and international science competitions, such as the Siemens Competition in Math, Science &amp; Technology. Last year, SIP interns made up a quarter of the California semifinalists in the Siemens competition. In addition, GuhaThakurta said many of the students who do astrophysics research projects present their findings in poster sessions at American Astronomical Society meetings.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Increasing diversity</strong></p>
<p>Increasing the diversity of SIP students and providing scholarships for those with financial needs have been priorities for GuhaThakurta as the program has grown. He noted the program has always had good gender diversity, with about 60 percent girls all along.</p>
<p>"This alone is a big achievement. We've found that many of them go on to pursue computer science degrees in college, and women are strongly underrepresented in that field," GuhaThakurta said.</p>
<p>He has been reaching out to regional public schools and partnering with outreach programs such as UCSC's <a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu/">Educational Partnership Center</a> and <a href="http://www.mindsmattersf.org/">Minds Matter of San Francisco</a> to recruit more students from underserved groups. "We've had four students from Minds Matter, a great program in San Francisco that focuses on high-achieving low-income students in the public schools. They're one of seven diversity partners we're working with to expand our outreach," GuhaThakurta said.</p>
<p>He is also working to establish a "bridge program" for students who may need additional support to navigate some of the challenges of the internship program or may feel intimidated by them. "The idea is to give them an opportunity to build their skills and work on projects in a controlled environment where we can give them as much guidance as they need," GuhaThakurta said. "We will focus on students who are disadvantaged due to socioeconomic status, would be the first in their family to go to college, or are from groups underrepresented in the STEM fields."</p>
<p>Escalona said she didn't apply for SIP in her sophomore year because she didn't think she was ready, but with hindsight she says she probably would have done fine. "Any high school student should think about it," she said. "No matter what skill level you think you are, you can do it. What matters is your motivation and the effort you put into it."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e26e7d518072701752a34ca39040853b"><name>dt-amajoyi-alumni-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nwadiuto “DT” Amajoyi: Leadership learned</title><summary>Born in Nigeria, Nwadiuto “DT” Amajoyi (College Nine ’13, psychology) has written speeches for a senator and prepared case files for Ugandan inmates.

<p>&#8220;I had a very vivid imagination,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I could spend hours playing make-believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even with that inventive mind, Amajoyi (College Nine &#8217;13, psychology) couldn&#8217;t have imagined the changes coming in her life, beginning with her family&#8217;s move to Southern California when &#8220;DT&#8221; (a nickname since childhood) was just 7 years old.</p>
<p>Twenty-six years later, she has written speeches for a senator, participated in the International Moot Court, and prepared case files for Ugandan inmates. These days she&#8217;s in London, pursuing an international law degree.</p>
<p>Amajoyi first learned about UC Santa Cruz through filling out a UC-wide college application; a visit to the campus left her awed by its beauty. She was deeply influenced by an on-campus outreach program, Destination Higher Education, led by African American students already attending the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an amazing weekend full of cultural pride and community,&#8221; she recalls. &#8220;The campus had a long way to go with its diversity numbers, but I thought, &#8216;This is a place where I can grow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>And grow she did.</p>
<p>Amajoyi&#8217;s extensive college involvement included serving as UC Santa Cruz student body president, Commissioner of Diversity, co-chair of the UC Student Association Council of Presidents, co-chair of the Engaging Education CARE Council, and a Destination Higher Education board member.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised myself that I&#8217;d actively push outside my comfort zone,&#8221; she comments. &#8220;I adopted the mantra &#8216;Never be comfortable,&#8217; because it&#8217;s when we&#8217;re most uncomfortable that we face the greatest challenges and grow the most.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Seeking discomfort included exploring the history of her black American and African communities, and delving deeply into issues of racism and discrimination. This, says Amajoyi, was her awakening.</p>
<p>&#8220;It produced pain, which turned into passion and then a desperate need to serve. It wasn&#8217;t enough to be angry&#8212;what was productive was organizing, so that&#8217;s what I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>For instance, while struggling to attain U.S. citizenship during college&#8212;and discovering that many of her friends were undocumented&#8212;she organized a day of action supporting the ultimately successful passage of the California Dream Act.</p>
<p>Amajoyi discovered teachers and mentors who encouraged her personal and academic growth. She found inspiration, solidarity, and support among fellow activists fighting for student rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still remember my first protest in Quarry Plaza, the sound of our voices in unison as we sang words we deeply believed, for rights we so deeply thought we deserved,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This was the student movement, and I was hooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amajoyi praises the value of her UC Santa Cruz degree and the leadership skills she developed during college. But she also remembers her sense of isolation and offers candid suggestions for improvements, from requiring classes in cultural competency and ethnic studies to hiring additional professors of color.&#160;</p>
<p>After graduating, Amajoyi acted as a California State Senate fellow before entering Pepperdine University School of Law. She also served legal internships with the Western Center on Law and Poverty, and with the Republic of Uganda&#8217;s Anti-Corruption Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see myself getting tired of service to other people,&#8221; she says. &#8220;My education has given me knowledge, and my travel and experiences have given me wisdom and empathy for people and their struggles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amajoyi returns regularly to Nigeria, which she still considers home. Her dual perspective of Third and First World countries has made her more critical of Nigeria and the United States but has also, in her words, made her love both countries more fervently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing up in Nigeria, I knew what suffering was; I could see it all around me. But somehow people found a way to be happy, to love, and to hope,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It's this resilience and hopefulness that has pushed me to pursue and achieve things I never would have thought possible for a little girl from my village.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/01/images/nwadiuto-dt-amajoyi.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/01/images/nwadiuto-dt-amajoyi.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nwadiuto-dt-amajoyi.jpg</name><display-name>nwadiuto-dt-amajoyi.jpg</display-name><file-size>9555</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt> Nwadiuto “DT” Amajoyi</thumb-alt><title> Nwadiuto “DT” Amajoyi</title><description>Alumna Nwadiuto “DT” Amajoyi—now pursuing an international law degree in London—pushed outside her comfort zone at UC Santa Cruz in search of growth.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f17a18a58072701752a34ca35566b6e2"><name>chung-faculty-research-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Sandra Chung to deliver 51st annual Faculty Research Lecture</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz professor of linguistics Sandra Chung will deliver the 51st annual Faculty Research Lecture on Tuesday, February 7, at 7 p.m. at the Music Recital Hall in the Performing Arts Complex.&#13;

 Trained in linguistics at Harvard University, Chung&#8217;s research focuses on syntax and semantics, and her contributions are empirical as well as theoretical. Her work helps explain similarities and differences of word order and agreement across languages, and their implications for communication and meaning. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;My two fields are syntactic theory and Austronesian languages--a family of some 1,200 languages dispersed over a vast area that includes the Pacific,&#8221; said Chung. &#8220;I've spent most of my academic life studying the structure of a very few of these languages: Maori, Samoan, Tongan, Indonesian, and especially Chamorro.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Although some Austronesian languages have millions of speakers, most are 'small' languages spoken by relatively small populations and many are endangered,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Chamorro, for instance, is an indigenous language of the Mariana Islands, in the Western Pacific. The language has roughly 40,000 speakers in the Marianas and is in the early stages of language endangerment. Working on small languages like Chamorro has helped me to appreciate how much they have to contribute to syntactic theory.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Chung noted that her lecture will focus on Chamorro and touch on some of the larger theoretical and socio-political issues that frame her research.<br/>
 <br/>
 An internationally renowned scholar, Chung is a past president of the Linguistics Society of America and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).&#160; She has received several National Science Foundation grants, and her affiliations beyond the University of California include the Max-Planck-Institut f&#252;r Psycholinguistik. <br/>
 <br/>
 She was honored with the Governor's Humanities Award for Preserving Traditional Cultural Practices (U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), and is a former Lansdowne Scholar and Fulbright Scholar. <br/>
 <br/>
 Chung has served as an editorial board member for several top-tier journals, including Linguistic Inquiry, Language; Language and Linguistics; Te Reo; and the Journal of East Asian Linguistics. She has also delivered more than 70 papers at conferences, professional meetings, and universities in the United States, New Zealand, Indonesia, Jakarta, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, and the Northern Mariana Islands, and has authored or co-authored over 40 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters. <br/>
 <br/>
 Chung is additionally a recipient of the UC Santa Cruz Excellence in Teaching Award and the Innovations in Teaching Award. And her American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) fellowship noted her &#8220;distinguished contributions to teaching and research in linguistics, advancing syntax through insights from under-studied languages, notably Chamorro, and engaging minority communities in linguistic research.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Since joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1986, Chung has served as chair of the Linguistics Department, chair of the Philosophy Department, and chair of the Committee on Academic Personnel. In addition to teaching syntax courses for the Linguistics major, she also teaches undergraduate classes in logic, poetics, and historical linguistics.<br/>

<p>The annual convocation celebrating King&#8217;s life and legacy begins at 7 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Jealous is the latest in a roster of high-profile speakers over the years. Last year&#8217;s headliner was Black Lives Matter cofounder <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/mlk-convocation-featuring-alicia-garza.html">Alicia Garza</a>. Previous speakers include radical activist and UC Santa Cruz professor emerita Angela Davis, Harvard professor Cornel West, and celebrated author Alice Walker.</p>
<p>Jealous led the NAACP from 2008 to 2012, when he decided to step down to spend more time with his family, pursue teaching opportunities, and devote his time to supporting African American candidates for political office. He was the youngest president the organization has ever had in its 108-year history; at the time of his election to NAACP president, he was only 35.</p>
<p>But his career with the venerable civil rights organization goes back even longer than that; he started out at the NAACP as a mail opener at the group&#8217;s Legal Defense Fund when he was only a teenager.</p>
<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> said the NAACP greatly increased its profile during Jealous&#8217;s tenure by focusing on &#8220;technological savvy,&#8221; bolstering its numbers of mobile subscribers and its email list while growing its revenue. In the process it became the nation&#8217;s largest nonpartisan and community-based voter registration operation.</p>
<p>The progressive activist and television commentator <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/02/2733.html">Van Jones</a>&#8212;the UC Santa Cruz Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation speaker in 2009&#8212;praised Jealous&#8217;s work with the NAACP in an interview with the <em>Post</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the time, the NAACP was seen by many as a fading brand,&#8221; Jones told the newspaper in 2013. &#8220;It was seen as your grandmama&#8217;s organization if not your great-grandmama&#8217;s &#8230; He comes in and completely turns the place around in what seems like overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Rhodes Scholar, Jealous was named by both <em>Fortune</em> and <em>Time</em> magazines to their &#8220;Top 40 under 40&#8221; lists, and was named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>Jealous has led movements to ban racial profiling and the death penalty and defend voting rights. He is currently a partner at Kapor Capital,&#160; based in Silicon Valley, where he is working to increase opportunities for minorities in the tech economy.</p>
<p>Lately, Jealous has been sounding off about the aftermath of President Donald Trump&#8217;s election defeat of Hillary Clinton. &#8220;The resistance begins today,&#8221; he wrote in an op-ed that appeared just after the election on NBCNews.com. &#8220;We must build robust movements &#8230; to defend our rights and those of our neighbors, protect our planet, end poverty and shift the world away from war and toward peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jealous, in the same piece, emphasized the importance of banding together and listening to those with opposing views, rather than allowing the national political climate to create hatred and polarization. &#8220;If you are tempted to dismiss most of Trump's supporters as being as hateful as his rhetoric, please don't,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;If you unfriended your Trump-loving friends on Facebook, re-friend them. If you don't know anyone who voted for Trump, make a new friend. Then listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the convocation, audience members will also get to meet this year&#8217;s recipient of the <a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/mlk/tony-hill-award-nomination.html">Tony Hill Award</a>, recognizing individuals whose lives and actions exemplify the late Tony Hill&#8217;s work and legacy.</p>
<p>Hill, a longtime advocate for social and economic justice in Santa Cruz County, was known for his skills as a community bridge-builder and mediator. He died in 2007 at age 62.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f57ad9298072701752a34ca355e75ef8"><name>crime-reports-website</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Police launch website mapping crime reports on campus</title><summary>The website gives users the option to narrow a search by date and type of crime report.</summary><keywords>crime, reporting, safety, information</keywords><start-date>1485874800000</start-date><display-name>Crime reports</display-name><path>/2017/01/crime-reports-website</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/crime-reports-website</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1485882184597</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1485882345543</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department has <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/crime-prevention/crime-log-and-map.html">launched a new website</a> that offers the campus community the opportunity to view information on crime reports, missing people, stolen vehicles, and more on a map of campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police department wants to make sure the community is informed about safety issues on the campus, and one way of doing that is by ensuring they have access to crime and incident information,&#8221; Chief Nader Oweis said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ucsc.crimegraphics.com/">website</a> gives users the option to narrow a search by date (up to 30 days in the past) and type of crime report. Users can also see crime reports as pushpins or a heat map.</p>
<p>The site should also help the department detect trends and patterns to crime, Oweis said.</p>
<p>The department has long posted a <a href="http://pdlogs.ucsc.edu/">summary of crime reports</a> on its website. However, the new site pulls that information and overlays it on a map. Additionally, the site will list the department&#8217;s Clery Act crime and fire log going back 60 days.</p>
<p>Each October, the department releases the <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/crime-prevention/clery.html">Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report</a>, which provides crime statistics as well as information on safety and security prevention and protection programs and much more. In addition, the University of California publishes a <a href="http://police-statistics.universityofcalifornia.edu/">report on crime throughout the UC system</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f60120b58072701752a34ca3ed42984c"><name>bfb-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proposed Revised Presidential Policy Business and Finance Bulletin (BFB) – G-28, Travel Regulations</title><start-date>1485882000000</start-date><display-name>Policy</display-name><path>/2017/01/bfb-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/bfb-policy</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1485890984807</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1485890984807</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University invites comments on Proposed Revised Presidential Policy Business and Finance Bulletin (BFB) &#8211; G-28, Travel Regulations.</p>

As soon as these allegations were reported, the campus acted swiftly to address the victim's claims, which appeared to be clear violations of the UC Santa Cruz policy on sexual violence and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The safety of our students is our top priority, and these alarming allegations demanded immediate attention. The campus cooperated with a law enforcement investigation and simultaneously launched a swift and thorough Title IX investigation of the allegations against the faculty member. When our preliminary investigation warranted action, we immediately removed the faculty member from campus, prohibited all contact with students, and placed the individual on leave pending the outcome of the Title IX investigation.</p>
<p>After the Title IX investigation was completed, and after the campus had begun formal disciplinary proceedings against the faculty member, he tendered his resignation, effective June 1, 2016.</p>
<p>The allegations were investigated in confidence, because our campus process respects the rights and privacy of all parties, but we investigated the victim's claims as soon as she came forward.</p>
<p>As a campus, we launch immediate inquiries and take formal disciplinary action when warranted. Until today's statement by attorneys representing the victim, we have avoided public comment to protect the student's privacy.</p>
<p>This case reminds us that we&#8212;faculty, staff, and students&#8212;each have responsibilities toward building a safe, supportive campus community. We will continue to strive to protect our students and ensure that victims receive all the support services we have in place. Resources and information are <a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu">available online</a>.</p>
<p>We are eager to see the day when sexual assault and harassment are not issues on college campuses, but as long as they are, we will continue to uphold the highest standards to protect our students, faculty, and staff.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="65b50c2b8072701752a34ca3c857625a"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2017/01/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/01/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1483470081037</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1483470081037</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
