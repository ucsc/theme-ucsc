platform for the effort to characterize every cell type in the human body</article-subhead><article-text><p>An international community of researchers is coalescing around the Human Cell Atlas Initiative, an ambitious plan to map and characterize every cell type in the human body.</p>
<p>In a significant step toward this goal, the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute will collaborate with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) to build a data coordination platform for the Human Cell Atlas. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), which is funding the project, announced the collaboration June 1 at a Human Cell Atlas meeting in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>Creating a comprehensive reference map of all human cells could transform our understanding of human health and disease, with potential impacts on almost every aspect of biomedical research.</p>
<p>"I'm very excited about the initiative and the people who are involved," said Jim Kent, research scientist at the UCSC Genomics Institute. "The science is really fundamental, and having a Human Cell Atlas will make work in almost every biomedical research lab go faster, much like the human genome sequence did. Once we had the genome, it became an incredibly useful framework for layering more information, because so much biology can be mapped to the genome. I think something like that will happen with the Human Cell Atlas too. It's sort of the missing link between the genome and the body."</p>
<p>It is a massive undertaking, however, that will require the combined efforts of a large community of researchers with diverse expertise. At the UCSC Genomics Institute, work on the data coordination platform is being led by Kent and research scientist Benedict Paten.</p>
<p>"The Human Cell Atlas is not only a fascinating and important biology project, it's also a very large computational and engineering project that is leading the way in terms of how to organize big data," Paten said. "This collaboration is bringing together a stellar engineering team to create a data commons that is maximally accessible and usable for a broad base of scientists."</p>
<p>The groups working on the data coordination platform are all distinguished organizations with demonstrated success in genomics, informatics, and data sharing. They have been instrumental in the success of several large international genomics data projects, including the Human Genome Project, and they have built widely used software libraries and data resources, including the UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser, Broad&#8217;s FireCloud platform, and EMBL-EBI's infrastructure for the analysis, sharing, and long-term preservation of molecular data.</p>
<p>The Human Cell Atlas Initiative is the brainchild of Sarah Teichmann at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Aviv Regev of the Broad Institute, who organized an international meeting to discuss the initiative in October 2016 in London. The Stockholm conference is the third Human Cell Atlas meeting.</p>
<p>The human body is made of trillions of cells, the most fundamental units of life. Different types of cells (neurons, blood cells, skin cells, etc.) express different sets of genes and make up the various tissues and organs of the body. A Human Cell Atlas would catalogue all cell types and sub-types in the human body, map their locations, identify the genes they express, and potentially much more.</p>
<p>Only recently have tools such as single-cell genomics made it realistic to envision such an atlas, which could reveal a new view of human biology and new opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating disease. By making the Human Cell Atlas available freely to scientists all over the world, the initiative aims to provide a transformative resource for the global biomedical research community.</p>
<p>The data coordination platform for the Human Cell Atlas will enable many researchers to easily submit large quantities of genomic and imaging data, perform robust and scalable analyses and quality-control checks on those data, and make both the data and the results of the analyses available widely and openly, maximizing the opportunity for downstream innovation.</p>
<p>In addition to providing financial support, CZI will also collaborate on aspects of the software engineering and data infrastructure operations. According to Paten, the tools developed for the data coordination platform will have value well beyond the scope of the Human Cell Atlas. The project will help demonstrate a new model for large-scale collaboration, bringing together biologists and software engineers across multiple research institutions to build a common platform and demonstrating the value of using open-source, cloud-based technologies to build the data infrastructure for global scientific collaborations.</p>
<p>At the UCSC Genomics Institute, technical director Brian O'Connor will join Paten and Kent in leading the institute's work on the data coordination platform. Anthony Philippakis will lead the effort at the Broad Institute, and John Marioni will lead EMBL-EBI's work on the project.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/01/human-cell-atlas-biology/</url><title>This map will help biologists learn more about the human body than ever before</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="647230df807270177c20a647b5e9e767"><name>new-cpevc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Welcoming new CP/EVC Marlene Tromp</title><summary>I’d like to offer a warm welcome to Marlene Tromp, who today officially joins us as campus provost/executive vice chancellor.</summary><start-date>1496300400000</start-date><display-name>Welcoming new CP/EVC Marlene Tromp</display-name><path>/2017/06/new-cpevc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/new-cpevc</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1496333822447</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496351326217</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/marlene-tromp.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/marlene-tromp.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marlene-tromp.jpg</name><display-name>marlene-tromp.jpg</display-name><file-size>135701</file-size><width>268</width><height>377</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/marlene-tromp-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/marlene-tromp-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marlene-tromp-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>marlene-tromp-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>3879</file-size><width>83</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I&#8217;d like to offer a warm welcome to Marlene Tromp, who today officially joins us as campus provost/executive vice chancellor.</p>
<p>I very much look forward to working with Marlene to move this campus forward, pursuing programs and projects that will foster our core mission of teaching, research, and public service. In all of our conversations, Marlene&#8217;s commitment to excellence has really stood out. She understands and appreciates the culture of UC Santa Cruz, but also brings experiences and ideas from other educational circles that will serve us well.</p>
<p>She comes to us from Arizona State University&#8217;s West Campus, where she was vice provost and a professor of English and women and gender studies. She has a track record of working closely with faculty, staff and students, advocating on their behalf within the larger ASU system.</p>
<p>As a first-generation college graduate, she appreciates the challenges facing students who are the first in their family to pursue a four-year degree. That&#8217;s vital experience for us, as low-income and first-generation students are applying to our campus in record numbers. You can read more about Marlene&#8217;s background in our initial <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/cpevc-tromp.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> when she was appointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diversity is hugely important to this campus and to the UC system as a whole,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;It&#8217;s vital that we reflect the growing diversity of California&#8212;and that we have the programs and people in place to support them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal presented seven Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Awards for Diversity, as well as the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Award, during a May 31 ceremony at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.</p>
<p>Anthropology Professor <strong>Olga Najera-Ramirez</strong> was presented with the lifetime achievement award, which recognizes her extraordinary contributions to diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Najera-Ramirez&#8217;s research centers on documenting and critically examining expressive culture among Mexicans in both Mexico and the United States. The scholarship addresses questions about identity formation, relationships of power, and expressive cultural forms.</p>
<p>In addition to research, she advises the student run Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los Mejicas. This group, which was honored with a diversity award in 2013, is currently <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2017/04/los-mejicas.html">celebrating its 45th year</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Stacy Philpott</strong>, a professor in the Environmental Studies Department, received an award for her work in community building, creative mentoring, program development, as well as inclusive academic and research efforts focused on students and staff from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds.</p>
<p>Philpott directs the Program in Community and Agroecology, which focuses on hands-on sustainable-living skills, food systems and food justice issues.</p>
<p>She is also a supporter of the youth-at-risk program Food What, and is a vocal backer of community gardens, one of her research areas.</p>
<p><strong>Yulianna Araceli Ortega Ramirez</strong>, director of the STEM Diversity Programs, was honored for being a dedicated and transformative educator.</p>
<p>She has been instrumental in designing and implementing a number of technology initiatives focused at advancing community college students from diverse backgrounds into STEM careers and in particular to increase the representation of Latino/a students in the sciences.</p>
<p>Over her 12 years of service, she has mentored more than 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students. As a first-generation college student and Latina in STEM, she understands the daily struggles, family pressures, and mental stress that minority students face every day.</p>
<p><strong>Donnae Smith</strong>, coordinator of diversity and inclusion programs in Colleges, Housing and Educational Services, developed an internship program that provides undocumented students with an opportunity to work in campus residential communities, promoting greater understanding and awareness of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Additionally, she develops curriculum for, and delivers training to, the more than 200 residential advisors, neighborhood advisors, and community advisors across campus, making sure they are comfortable with diversity and inclusion issues. She also teaches courses for the Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program, and has spearheaded the creation of the We Are Slugs! Diversity Orientation to be launched during the 2019&#8211;2020 academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Maya Alicia Iverson</strong>, a fifth-year graduate student in the Sociology Department, studies race, television, and archives. She has been a member of the Black Experience Team since 2014, and currently serves as co-chair.</p>
<p>She has managed outreach efforts through social media platforms and communications to UCSC&#8217;s African, black, and Caribbean student organizations, among others.</p>
<p>She also has been instrumental in maintaining growing relationships with alumni. She worked with founding member of the Black Alumni Association, Shonelle Blake, to organize the Alumni Weekend program &#8220;In Celebration of Black Life at UCSC,&#8221; which featured alumni testimonies and memorabilia that were used to create a &#8220;memory space&#8221; that spoke to the various ways UCSC&#8217;s black community has and continues to affirm its place and presence on campus.</p>
<p><strong>Abir Zehra Rashid</strong>, a College Nine student majoring in business, was recognized for the passion and dedication she brings to the Muslim Student Association.</p>
<p>As a board member of the MSA, Rashid has developed close relationships with many campus organizations. She was also the lead facilitator and organizer for one of the MSA&#8217;s biggest events, the MSA West Conference.</p>
<p>She took 30 UC Santa Cruz students to a conference at UC Riverside, where nationally renowned scholars, activists, and athletes spoke about what it means to be Muslim today. Rashid brought that knowledge back to campus, where she worked with students groups on being allies, and on educating the campus about Islamophobia and the impacts of executive orders banning Muslims.</p>
<p><strong>The Nekses Social Justice Retreat</strong> was honored for its work in creating social change makers. The program was developed in the summer of 2015 to help students understand more about their intersecting identities, the identities of others, and how perceptions of identities are influenced.</p>
<p>The curriculum is presented by a small group of campus partners who hold a variety of positions across campus. These facilitators, identified each year, volunteer their time and help develop the content from one year to the next.</p>
<p>The goal of the retreat is to raise the consciousness of UCSC students, while providing them with the necessary tools to apply what they learn to their academic, work, and personal lives.</p>
<p>The award was accepted by Julie Oberts, associate college administrative officer at Stevenson and Cowell colleges; Donnae Smith, coordinator of diversity and inclusion programs in CHES; Kathy Cooney, associate college administrative officer at Porter and Kresge colleges; and Janet Nava, coordinator for residential education at Kresge.</p>
<p>Blumenthal presented the Women in Science and Engineering Award&#8212;the &#8220;WiSE&#8221; award&#8212;to<strong>&#160;&#211;l&#246;f Einarsd&#243;ttir</strong>, a professor with the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.</p>
<p>Einarsd&#243;ttir has promoted women in STEM in a wide range of ways throughout her career. She has mentored female graduate students in her laboratory, encouraging and supporting them to the next stages of their careers in both academia and industry.</p>

<p>Indian Americans are the wealthiest and most highly educated immigrants in the country. But there's nothing special about Indians per se, according to Economics Professor Nirvikar Singh, coauthor of <em>The Other One Percent: Indians in America</em>.</p>
<p>Since 1965, the selection process in India has favored the most privileged members of society&#8212;those from the educated, upper classes&#8212;and U.S. immigration policies further advantaged high-achieving students and skilled workers.</p>
<p>"There is no 'secret sauce.' There are no peculiarly Indian cultural traits," said Singh. "They came very carefully selected. They were not coming from poverty. The simplest policy prescription may be this: Make sure everyone has access to education."</p>
<p>Coauthored with Sanjoy Chakravorty, a geographer, and Devesh Kapur, a political scientist, <em>The Other One Percent: Indians in America</em> (Oxford University Press, 2016), breaks down the fascinating story of how a population from a poor developing country with low education became the most educated, highest-income group in the world's most advanced nation&#8212;in a single generation.</p>
<p>Now numbering more than 3 million, people of Indian origin make up 1 percent of the U.S. population&#8212;hence the book's title&#8212;and would surge to 2 percent by 2030, if current trends were to continue. More than 75 percent have arrived since the 1990s.</p>
<p>The flow of Indians to the United States began in 1965, when the U.S. relaxed its immigration policies. Coming disproportionately from the upper castes, those early migrants sought educational and employment opportunities that set in motion a pattern of success that would be replicated across generations:</p>
<p>&#8226; 68 percent of India-born immigrants living in the U.S. have college degrees;</p>
<p>&#8226; Indian immigrants are concentrated in industries like information technology;</p>
<p>&#8226; Their average incomes are generally higher than the average incomes associated with their level of educational attainment;</p>
<p>&#8226; Rates of self-employment and entrepreneurship are higher at both the high and low ends of the income scale, reflecting engagement in both hospitality and retail, as well as medicine and the high-tech industry;</p>
<p>&#8226; Though Indians make up 1 percent of the population, they comprise 8 percent of the founders of high-tech companies&#8212;and one-third of technology startups in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>"Indian American entrepreneurship has been quite prominent," said Singh, whose contributions to the book included the role of entrepreneurship in the success of Indian immigrants. "It's a very important engine of economic growth."</p>
<p>Indian immigrants who were shut out of corporate jobs and professions because of discrimination followed one classic immigrant path, starting out in retail, hotels, restaurants, and convenience stores. Nevertheless, many of them emerged as entrepreneurial "success stories," said Singh: "Someone who started out working in a gas station might end up owning twelve of them."</p>
<p>However, Indian migrants who come to the United States as refugees and those who enter the country illegally&#8212;lacking education and legal status&#8212;have a much harder time adjusting.</p>
<p>"Your path to success as an immigrant depends a lot on what you bring in and what your constraints are in your new home," he said. "Without educational resources and a stable financial background, migrants typically get stuck. Socioeconomic factors are much more determining than any cultural traits."</p>
<p>The future of immigration policy is more fraught today than at any time in recent memory, noted Singh. How Indians in America&#8212;as well as those who aspire to come to the U.S.&#8212;will be impacted remains to be seen.</p>
<p>"Economists talk about 'social capital'&#8212;basically, who you know&#8212; and 'human capital'&#8212;the value of education," he added. "In the United States, a major barrier to social mobility is inequality of access to education. That's a persistent challenge. That lack of social and income mobility is the core of the '1 percent' problem of income inequality in this country."</p>
<p>Looking broadly at the U.S. economy, Singh describes the end of the post-World War II boom fueled by global trade and open capital markets&#8212;and anticipates dramatic changes that will dictate workforce needs.</p>
<p>"In some ways, we have reached the peak of the era of big corporations," he said. "Because technology and the economic structure are changing, the era of big corporations employing large numbers is ending."</p>
<p>The next wave of major structural changes in the economy will be driven by information technology and by climate change, both of which will drive changes in how energy is generated and consumed, Singh predicted.</p>
<p>"We want a system that prepares young people for a drastically different economy than their parents experienced," he said. "Immigration policy has allowed the United States to skim the educational cream of Indian society in STEM fields that will be important for this structural transformation. In some sense, Indian Americans have been filling a gap in the American system. I don't think President Trump appreciates the importance of science and technology education."</p>
<p>Politically, Indian Americans identify as Democrats by a margin of 10:1, and population growth suggests they could play key roles as swing voters in Texas and Georgia in the next decade and beyond. Today, 80 percent of second-generation Indian Americans are under the age of 25, which means many are only beginning to exert their influence on U.S. society.</p>
<p>Singh says there is another dimension to the story: "It's really about what kind of America do we want, as Americans," he said. "We've been heading toward an America that is more pluralistic. The Indian American story is one window on that bigger issue."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="696ddb62807270177c20a64705d3a380"><name>broken-chromosomes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Hail Mary' mechanism can rescue cells with severely damaged chromosomes</title><summary>Understanding the mechanisms involved in chromosome repair, and how they can fail, may lead to new strategies to combat cancer.</summary><keywords>William Sullivan, broken chromosomes, DNA repair, DNA tether, chromosome fragments</keywords><start-date>1496671200000</start-date><display-name>'Hail Mary' mechanism can rescue cells with severely damaged chromosomes</display-name><path>/2017/06/broken-chromosomes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/broken-chromosomes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1496417424864</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496672040190</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJVu2Kp0wVo" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/chromosome-fragment-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/chromosome-fragment-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chromosome-fragment-350.jpg</name><display-name>chromosome-fragment-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>49614</file-size><width>350</width><height>464</height></image><image-alt>dividing cell with broken chromosome</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/chromosome-fragment-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/chromosome-fragment-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chromosome-fragment-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>chromosome-fragment-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16461</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>dividing cell with broken chromosome</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>In this dividing cell, chromosome fragments (red) remain in the middle of the green spindle structure, while the rest of the chromosomes have segregated to the two poles.

Those safeguards can fail, however, and a cell may find itself trying to divide into two daughter cells with a loose chromosomal fragment drifting away from a broken chromosome.</p>
<p>William Sullivan calls this a "worst case scenario" for the cell. The potential consequences include cell death or a cancerous cell growing out of control. But Sullivan, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, has found that the cell still has one more trick up its sleeve to rescue the broken chromosome.&#160;</p>
<p>The latest findings from Sullivan's lab, published in the June 5 issue of <em><a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/early/2017/05/11/jcb.201604079">Journal of Cell Biology</a></em>, reveal new aspects of a remarkable mechanism that carries broken chromosomes through the process of cell division so that they can be repaired and function normally in the daughter cells. Sullivan has been studying this process in the fruit fly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. His lab has created a strain of flies in which broken chromosomes are common due to the expression of a DNA-cutting enzyme.</p>
<p>"We have flies in which 80 percent of the cells have double-strand breaks in the DNA, and the flies are fine," he said. "The cell has this amazing mechanism, like a Hail Mary pass with time running out."</p>
<p><strong>DNA tether</strong></p>
<p>The mechanism involves the creation of a DNA tether which acts as a lifeline to keep the broken fragment connected to the chromosome. Powerful new microscopy techniques enable researchers to observe the whole process in living cells, with bright fluorescent tags highlighting the chromosomes and other cellular components.</p>
<p>When a cell divides, it duplicates its chromosomes to make one set for each of the daughter cells. The membrane around the nucleus, which keeps the chromosomes separate from the rest of the cell, breaks down. The two sets of chromosomes then line up and segregate to opposite sides of the cell, pulled apart by a structure of microtubules called the spindle. A new nuclear envelope forms around each set of chromosomes, and new cell membranes separate the two daughter cells.</p>
<p>Sullivan's research has shown that chromosome fragments don't segregate with the rest of the chromosomes, but get pulled in later just before the newly forming nuclear membrane closes. "The DNA tether seems to keep the nuclear envelope from closing, and then the chromosome fragment just glides right in at the last moment," Sullivan said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Genetic rearrangements</strong></p>
<p>If this mechanism fails, however, and the chromosome fragment gets left outside the nucleus, the consequences are dire. The fragment forms a "micronucleus" with its own membrane and becomes prone to extensive rearrangements of its genetic material, which can then be reincorporated into chromosomes during the next cell division. Micronuclei and genetic rearrangements are commonly seen in cancer cells.</p>
<p>"We want to understand the mechanism that keeps that from happening," Sullivan said. "We are currently identifying the genes responsible for generating the DNA tether, which could be promising novel targets for the next generation of cancer therapies."</p>
<p>Sullivan has just received a new four-year, $1.5 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to continue this research.</p>
<p>Graduate student Travis Karg is first author of the new paper, which shows that spindle microtubules play an important role in driving the delayed segregation of chromosome fragments. The other coauthors, in addition to Sullivan, are Mary Williard Elting and Sophie Dumont at UC San Francisco and Hannah Vicars at UC Santa Cruz. This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="69c696eb807270177c20a647edc5758d"><name>materials-science</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Materials Science and Engineering Initiative focuses on sustainability</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz researchers are developing new materials for a wide range of devices and products, from solar cells to surfboards.</summary><keywords>David Lederman, Jairo Velasco, Yuan Ping, Jin Zhang, materials science</keywords><start-date>1496757600000</start-date><display-name>Materials Science and Engineering Initiative focuses on sustainability</display-name><path>/2017/06/materials-science</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/materials-science</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1496423240028</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1497490923188</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/david-lederman-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/david-lederman-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david-lederman-375.jpg</name><display-name>david-lederman-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>109341</file-size><width>375</width><height>512</height></image><image-alt>David Lederman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/graphene-device-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/graphene-device-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>graphene-device-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>graphene-device-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22344</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>microscope image of graphene device</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Physics professor David Lederman leads the Materials Science and Engineering Initiative.

<p>UC Santa Cruz physicist David Lederman studies the materials needed to create and control skrymions, which are very stable, very small magnetic structures. He leads a team of scientists and engineers at three UC campuses and a national laboratory who are working to understand the fundamental physics of these structures while assessing the feasibility of using them in data storage and processing devices.</p>
<p>Like the field of materials science in general, the project straddles the divide between basic and applied research. "There's a lot of fundamental science involved, but at the end of the day, you want to come up with something useful," Lederman said.</p>
<p>Materials science is also inherently interdisciplinary, he said, involving chemistry, physics, engineering, and even biology. Lederman directs the <a href="https://mse.ucsc.edu/">Materials Science and Engineering Initiative</a> at UC Santa Cruz, which includes faculty in several departments in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Biomaterials</strong></p>
<p>Marco Rolandi, for example, is an associate professor of electrical engineering who looks to biological systems for inspiration in developing innovative materials, including biocompatible materials for implantable medical devices. One spin-off from his lab is a biodegradable alternative to polyurethane and polystyrene foams for surfboards. Cruz Foam, a company cofounded this year by Rolandi and graduate students John Felts and Xiaolin Zhang, uses shrimp shells, discarded by the millions of tons per year, to make a sustainable structural foam.</p>
<p>Shrimp shells, like the exoskeletons of all crustaceans and insects, contain a natural polymer called chitin. "It's like the cellulose of the sea, but instead of making paper out of trees, we're taking a waste product from the seafood industry and transforming it into something of value using a water-based, environmentally friendly process," Rolandi said. "Right now we're targeting surfboards, but lots of things are made of foam, so there are other possibilities."</p>
<p>Sustainability is a central focus of the materials science efforts at UC Santa Cruz. Researchers in physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering are investigating new materials for photovoltaic cells and other solar energy conversion technologies, as well as materials for fuel cells, energy storage devices, and more efficient electronics.</p>
<p>"In electronics, we're always looking to use less power," Lederman said. "And sustainability means not just energy efficiency but also water efficiency, so we need to develop industrial processes that use less water and less energy. There is a lot of interest on campus in solving these problems, and we want to be part of the solution."</p>
<p><strong>Nanotechnology</strong></p>
<p>In recent decades, nanotechnology has come to play an increasingly important role in materials science. The properties of materials change dramatically when their dimensions approach the scale of nanometers (one nanometer is a billionth of a meter, so there are more than 25 million nanometers in an inch). Nanostructured materials have a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>Chemistry professor Jin Zhang began studying nanoparticles shortly after he arrived at UC Santa Cruz in 1992. "We got lucky going into nanotechnology in the early stages, not realizing that it would be such a hot field later on," Zhang said. "We want to understand the fundamental properties of these materials, because that matters for how they function in applications such as solar energy conversion, energy storage, and even cancer treatment."</p>
<p>The number of faculty engaged in materials science research at UC Santa Cruz has grown significantly, creating more opportunities for collaboration, Zhang said. "You want to have a critical mass of people for good interactions and collaborations," he said. "A lot of the things I'm most proud of in my work came about through chance meetings and just talking to people. It can change your whole scientific career sometimes."</p>
<p>Zhang and other senior faculty, such as chemist Shaowei Chen, physicists Lederman and Sue Carter, and electrical engineer Nobuhiko Kobayashi, have well-established reputations in the field of materials science, which has helped the campus attract a number of talented young faculty members.</p>
<p>Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, is among the new materials science faculty hired in the past few years. Ping's specialty is computational materials science, developing and using advanced computational methods to predict the properties of materials. As a theorist, she works closely with experimental researchers to help them develop novel materials with the properties needed for applications such as photovoltaic cells, batteries, or hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>"We develop new theoretical and computational methods and use high-performance computing to do realistic simulations of complex materials and nanostructures," Ping said. "We always work in a loop with experimentalists. Their results feed into my models, and I can tell them, for example, if you tune a certain parameter you can get a different result, and then they do experiments to validate that."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;New laboratories</strong></p>
<p>The campus has built new materials science laboratories at 2300 Delaware Avenue, a former Texas Instruments facility bought by UCSC in 2004. "The labs are beautiful, with state-of-the-art equipment, and there's room for expansion in the future," Lederman said.</p>
<p>Jairo Velasco, an assistant professor of physics, is one of four faculty members in the new laboratories. He studies the novel electronic properties that emerge in nanoscale devices based on layered, two-dimensional materials. Graphene, for example, is a thin layer of carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal honeycomb pattern, and it has received a lot of attention for its unusual properties.</p>
<p>"These materials are exciting both for the potential technological applications in electronic devices, and also because they offer opportunities to explore important fundamental questions in physics," Velasco said.</p>
<p>Velasco and Ping both arrived at UCSC last summer and are excited about developing new collaborations with their colleagues on campus. They are working on a proposal together to investigate defects in two-dimensional materials that could potentially be used as a platform for quantum computing.</p>
<p>"Materials science requires a high level of collaboration between experimentalists and theorists, and also between scientists in different disciplines," Velasco said. "It's also a research direction that easily incorporates undergraduate participation, and students find it interesting because we're developing new ideas for technology that they could be using on an everyday basis in the future."</p>
<p>An Undergraduate Research Summer Program on Sustainable Materials at UC Santa Cruz was just funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Lederman leads the program, which aims to increase the retention and graduation rates of underrepresented minorities and women in science and engineering. It will focus on recruiting motivated students from community colleges and other minority-serving undergraduate institutions in Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties.</p>
<p>Students in the program will work on interdisciplinary research projects in materials science and engineering, gaining valuable experience and perhaps being inspired to pursue graduate studies in the field. This grant from NSF's highly competitive Research Experience for Undergraduates program is just one indication of UCSC's emerging strength in materials science and engineering.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://mse.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Materials Science &amp; Engineering Initiative</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="69d7772f807270177c20a6478721bf1d"><name>crime-bulletin-knife</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletin: 417 PC—Brandishing with a knife (Case 17-604)</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the community's assistance with identifying a man who brandished a knife at a student.</summary><start-date>1496386800000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletin: 417 PC—Brandishing with a knife (Case 17-604)</display-name><path>/2017/06/crime-bulletin-knife</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/crime-bulletin-knife</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1496424345967</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1496424345967</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the community's assistance with identifying a man who brandished a knife at a student.</p>
<p>At approximately 10:20 p.m. on Thursday, June 1, a student was sitting on a bench at the Porter College Quad when he was approached by two Latino men. One of the men became verbally aggressive toward the student. As the student attempted to leave the area, one of the men brandished a knife at the student. The other Latino man pulled the suspect away, and both of them left the area toward the Porter College Apartments.</p>
<p>The two suspects are described as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 19- or 20-year-old Latino man, about 5-feet, 8-inches tall, weighing about 140 pounds. He had black "shaggy" hair that covered his forehead, and was wearing a black, button-up jacket.</li>
<li>A 19- or 20-year-old Latino male, about 5-feet, 8-inches tall with "slick back hair."</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who may be a witness or has information regarding this crime is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at <a href="tel:(831)%20459-2231">831-459-2231, ext. 1</a>.</p>

This year we have made several enhancements to the graduate and undergraduate curriculum, as well as to our online offerings.</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce the following changes to the UC Santa Cruz curriculum this academic year:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Social Documentation M.F.A. degree program was established in the Film and Digital Media Department (FDM). The program will develop in students the skills necessary to become leaders in the production of documentary media that advances social justice.</li>
<li>The Science Education B.S. has been approved. This program will provide students with broad training in the physical and biology sciences in order to prepare them for careers teaching science in California high schools. The program is designed to consolidate several existing science education programs on campus.</li>
<li>With the approval of the Science Education B.S., both the Bio-Education Concentration and Physics Education B.S. were discontinued.</li>
<li>The Department of Languages and Applied Linguistics established a B.A. in Applied Linguistics and Multilingualism. The program will train students to understand the workings of the human mind and human behavior through the study of sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, functional grammar, language acquisition, and foreign language pedagogy.</li>
<li>The campus has established an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computational Media. These innovative degree programs will prepare graduates to take leading roles in the burgeoning field of computational media&#8212;a field for which California is a major hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>Faculty have also been active in developing and launching fully online courses.</p>
<p>This summer, faculty will offer 20 different courses online, allowing students to enroll from anywhere in the world where there is internet access. In the past year, the campus increased its offering of free online courses on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/ucsc">Coursera</a> from two to six, adding new courses on statistics, programming in C++, and on the natural acquisition of literacy</p>
<p>This summer will see the launch of two new online courses: Professor Erika Zavaleta&#8217;s popular course on the ecosystems of California, and a timely course from Professor Emeritus Peter Kenez on Russian history.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6acaba27807270177c20a6473004a8f3"><name>p4p-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pay for Performance Update</title><summary>This is an update on our ongoing Pay for Performance program.

<p>At our campus we have managed these programs with a team comprised of SHR and cross-functional managers. This team has been working vigorously to provide the campus with an interim online appraisal system to facilitate and simplify the communication and feedback process.</p>
<p><strong>Divisional Administrators</strong> (DAs)<br/>
 Divisional and departmental administrators are the point of contact with SHR for the performance appraisal cycle and online appraisal tool. This group has been identified and confirmed by their divisions. Divisional Administrators will have high level access to the new appraisal system. System access for DAs is anticipated to begin by June 6.</p>
<p><strong>Retiring Supervisors and Supervisors with Furloughed Employees*</strong><br/>
 For retiring supervisors and supervisors with furlough employees, the system will be available on Monday, June 12. Use of the online tool will be optional for these groups. The new online appraisal tool simplifies and standardizes the process and this group is strongly encouraged to take advantage of this time saving tool. Because the deadline is short, supervisors should bypass the online employee self appraisal process and solicit that input from the employees directly. Please contact your DA for system access.</p>
<p>*CX (Teamsters) represented employees will not be participating in the online appraisal process at this time.</p>
<p><strong>All Other Employees</strong><br/>
 The online appraisal tool will be used for the July appraisal call. Self help guides and FAQs will be provided. Employees are encouraged to take advantage of the town hall demonstrations of the online appraisal tool. The town hall schedule can be found <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/compensation/comp_programs/p4p-merit-program/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Town halls will be held on campus and at Scotts Valley with Zoom access.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Management</strong><br/>
 The purpose of performance management and pay programs is to effectively engage our staff in the mission of the university: education, research and public service. We are all responsible for doing our part in this endeavor. Goal setting, performance feedback and two way-communications require everyone to play an important role.<br/>
 We continue to emphasize the importance of managers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set SMART (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>pecific, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">m</span>easurable, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span>chievable, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">r</span>elevant, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">t</span>ime-bound) or SIMple (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span>pecific, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">i</span>mportant, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">m</span>easurable) goals with their teams and team members.</li>
<li>Provide at least monthly feedback and coaching to their direct reports about performance and progress on goals.</li>
<li>Provide growth and developmental opportunities to their team members.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the upcoming year-end review cycle SHR and a few dedicated unit colleagues have provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training on how to set goals and conduct performance feedback.</li>
<li>The e-tool is in the final stages of development and will replace the various paper forms used previously. Training on how to use this new tool is available now and is combined with the Goal and Feedback training in the <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/training/course_listings/prof-development.html#leadership-management-development" target="_blank">Focus on Performance training series</a>.</li>
<li>Revised definitions for the five levels of performance: 
<ul>
<li>Exceptional</li>
<li>Consistently Exceeded Expectations</li>
<li>Met Expectations</li>
<li>Improvement Needed</li>
<li>Unacceptable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pay for Performance Merit Program</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will again have a 3% pool to be used for annual merit pay.</li>
<li>Managers should take the following factors into account when making annual pay decisions: 
<ul>
<li>Performance on individual and team goals for the total period under review</li>
<li>Consideration of where the employee falls on the pay range for the current job</li>
<li>History of pay changes and positioning in relation to comparable jobs</li>
<li>Equity issues that may be relevant at the same time merit pay program decisions are being made</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline for appraisals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>July 28, 2017 -- appraisals due for all policy covered (non-represented) staff</li>
<li>September 1, 2017 -- appraisals due for represented staff</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anticipated Merit Dates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Merit call -- 1st week in August</li>
<li>Anticipated merit payouts -- October pay -- monthly and bi-weekly (retroactive to July 1)</li>

Now, Main will be the next person to step into the role she helped shape.</p>
<p>Main, assistant vice chancellor of Communications and Marketing at UC Santa Cruz, has been selected as the next <a href="http://staffadvisors.universityofcalifornia.edu/contact/index.html">Staff Advisor-Designate to the Regents</a>. Her two-year appointment begins July 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having seen this program from its infancy and seen different staff advisors step into the role and have an impact, I wanted to apply,&#8221; Main said. &#8220;The time commitment is huge, but the opportunity to impact staff around the system is bigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Main will join current Staff Advisor Jason Valdry, a director of technology at UC Irvine, in bringing the voice and perspective of staff to Board of Regents discussions. Departing Staff Advisor LaWana Richmond, a senior business analyst at UC San Diego, will complete her two-year term on June 30.</p>
<p>President Napolitano selected Main as part of a systemwide process. Applications were solicited across the UC system. A selection committee, which included systemwide and campus leaders and current and past staff advisors, reviewed the applications and selected finalists for the president&#8217;s consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sherry brings a wealth of experience, insight and passion that will serve her well as a staff advisor and serve us well as a university,&#8221; President Napolitano said. &#8220;I look forward to the valuable staff perspective she will bring to the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Main joined UC Santa Cruz as an assistant vice chancellor in 2015, but her connection to UC dates back to her days as a college student. Main earned her bachelor&#8217;s degree at UC Davis and her MBA at UC Irvine. She spent 14 years in communications roles at UC Irvine. During her tenure there, she served on committees and organizations, including Staff Assembly and the Chancellor&#8217;s Committee on the Status of Staff. And it was while serving as vice chair of the UC Irvine Staff Assembly that Main participated in the systemwide effort to create the Staff Advisors to the Regents program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Staff had no direct, consistent way to interact with the regents,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We wanted to give staff a presence, an ability to voice their concerns, in a timely and continuous way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through her experiences at multiple campuses, Main discovered that programs and services can vary from location to location. As a staff advisor, she wants to explore what different campuses offer, identify best practices, and find a way to share those across the system so staff at every campus can benefit from the best that UC has to offer.</p>
<p>Among her top priorities, Main said she plans to advocate for increased professional development to help staff succeed in their careers at UC and to support workforce retention. She points to a special program at UC Irvine that provides scholarships to staff who want to take classes, attend a conference, complete a certificate program or earn a master&#8217;s degree. The annual program is funded through the Staff Assembly&#8217;s fundraising campaign, with financial support from the chancellor and executive vice chancellor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity for staff [at Irvine] to advance their careers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to find out about other programs at other campuses too, so we can learn from each other and pull together some best practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Main also plans to advocate for enhanced wellness programs, as well as increased elder care and child care support. Many staff members are juggling their work while caring for children and aging parents, and that can take a toll, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more ways we can invest in staff, we can create a better work environment and help staff grow in their UC careers,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She knows there are other issues that staff are concerned about, and she wants to hear from them. She plans to spend her first year as staff advisor listening to staff, gathering ideas for solutions, and brainstorming with colleagues on possible improvements, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want people to share their thoughts and concerns with me. I hope to hear from a diverse range of voices and perspectives,&#8221; Main said. &#8220;I like communications because it builds bridges. And I see the staff advisor role as building bridges between staff and the regents.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7982458b807270177c20a64718e143e8"><name>annual-transportation-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual transportation survey</title><summary>UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is launching its annual survey to collect data on the travel patterns of our students, faculty, and staff.

<p>The funds were part of a package of initiatives proposed by De Leo&#769;n and approved by state legislators to address issues of access and student success for low-income students and students from underrepresented minority groups.</p>
<p>The group presented preliminary findings from the project which brought community-based theater productions to the campus to provide African/Black and Latinx community perspectives and serve as the basis for facilitated dialogues about race.</p>
<p>The May 31 meetings were scheduled at the invitation of Watsonville Mayor Oscar Rios, who said that one of his goals is to encourage young people to consider careers in government or serving in elected office.</p>
<p><span>After meeting with the senators, the delegation was honored by being introduced from the floor of the senate by Monning, who invited the senators to welcome the group and recognize it for its work on issues of diversity.</span></p>

Three campus-connected ventures&#8212;Fuzz Stati0n, Santa Cruz Wave Works, and Scoot Science&#8212;along with a fourth startup, PhotoBloomAR, will begin a pilot cohort with <a href="http://www.santacruzworks.org/programs/accelerator">Santa Cruz Accelerates</a> this month.&#160;</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Office of Research will provide $500,000 for the accelerator program to serve early-stage technology businesses that have a product but haven&#8217;t started selling it. The accelerator will be run by <a href="http://www.santacruzworks.org/">Santa Cruz Works</a>, a local nonprofit that supports science and technology companies.</p>
<p>Mohamed Abousalem, assistant vice chancellor for the Office of Research, Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization, said the University of California is committed to ensuring that the knowledge and research developed on its campuses are used to the fullest possible extent so the benefits reach the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is supporting Santa Cruz Accelerates in an effort to further UC&#8217;s educational and scientific research purposes through an accelerated commercialization mechanism that provides entrepreneurial education, training, support, mentorship, and funding opportunities,&#8221; said Abousalem, who joined campus a year ago. &#8220;This will help generate economic development in the community through our intellectual capital and innovation.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>The accelerator is one of seven programs supported by UC Santa Cruz that will help local entrepreneurs take their businesses to the next level. The effort is supported by a <a href="../01/innovation-and-entrepreneurship.xml">$2.2 million innovation-and-entrepreneurship investment</a> from the state and matching funding from outside private sources.</p>
<p>Operating under the umbrella of the Support Program for Long-term Innovation, Commercialization &amp; Entrepreneurship (SPLICE), the other initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>two business incubators, Startup Sandbox in Santa Cruz and SVLink at the Silicon Valley campus;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://ideahub.sites.ucsc.edu/">IDEA Hub</a>, launched by the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development (CIED);</li>
<li>a new arts program, Internship for Creative Entrepreneurship (ICE);</li>
<li>another arts program called Games Grant Opportunity (GameGO); and</li>
<li>a &#8220;proof-of-concept&#8221; grant program for researchers called Launchpad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accelerators were started in the U.S. a dozen years ago to provide advice, guidance, and resources to startups. The local model will operate as an intensive boot camp with a compressed timeline of six months, shared office space on the West Side, assigned executive mentors, networking events, workshops, and panel discussions. Santa Cruz Accelerates will give each company $10,000 in seed money in exchange for a 2 percent equity stake granted to Santa Cruz Works.</p>
<p>&#8220;The accelerator is unique because it is highly dependent on volunteer experts who will mentor these young startups,&#8221; said Heather Putnam, executive director of Santa Cruz Works. &#8220;We&#8217;re really excited to support entrepreneurs who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise get the help and support they need to start and grow their businesses in Santa Cruz.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p>Putnam is building the mentor network from volunteers locally and over the hill. She&#8217;s also developed its curriculum, which uses the <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything">Lean Business Model Canvas</a>, to have participants generate value propositions and test them with potential customers, adjusting their business plans based on what they learn.</p>
<p>Participants in Santa Cruz Accelerates are chosen in a competitive application process that prioritizes diversity and is open to startups in biotech, ag tech, creative technologies, internet of things/hardware, action sports/transportation tech, social good tech, and green technology.</p>
<p>"I am very stoked and honored to have been selected to join the Santa Cruz Accelerates inaugural cohort,&#8221; said David Moore, who got his bachelor&#8217;s degree in Computational Mathematics from UC Santa Cruz in 1991 and founded Fuzz Stati0n ten months ago. &#8220;The mentorship, development program, and networking opportunities will drive our growth and make us a more robust startup. As a solo founder, I am also looking forward to meeting and spending time with the other founders in the accelerator."</p>
<p>Jonathan LaRiviere, one of the founders of Scoot Science, said, &#8220;As a new venture, our resources are extremely limited, but with help from Santa Cruz Accelerates and their network in the Santa Cruz business community, we&#8217;ll be better able to efficiently tackle the kinds of problems that often have new founders stumped.&#160;And, of course, we&#8217;re also very excited to be a part of a cohort of new founders having shared experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following ventures were chosen for the pilot program:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><a href="https://fuzzstati0n.com/"><strong>Fuzz Stati0n</strong></a> helps unearth programming errors with a cloud-based, automated security procedure for code; founded by David Moore, a UCSC alumnus, with the help of Joe Carlos, a UCSC software engineer intern<strong>.</strong></li>

<br/>
 Highlighting materials from multiple collections housed in the Library&#8217;s Special Collections &amp; Archives, the exhibit features posters, photography, and memorabilia from the Grateful Dead Archive and photographs from Ruth-Marion Baruch&#8217;s 1967 <em>Haight-Ashbury</em> series.<br/>
<br/>
 It also spotlights a selection of items from the Library&#8217;s exceptionally rich holdings in alternative publications from this colorful time period, including a variety of newspapers and magazines, comic books, literary journals, broadsides, and political tracts.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;This exhibit documenting the Summer of Love comprises only materials held by the University Library,&#8221; noted Elisabeth Remak-Honnef, head of Special Collections &amp; Archives at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;We want to provide context for the Grateful Dead in 1967 and to highlight two high-profile collections (the Grateful Dead Archive and the Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Photography collection) as well as lesser known materials from both Special Collections and the McHenry stacks.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Remak-Honnef added that there is a reading corner upstairs in Special Collections on the third floor of McHenry Library for those visitors who are interested in actually browsing some of the publications on display.<br/>
<br/>
 It includes conventional and alternative publications such as the <em>Oracle</em>, <em>Berkeley Barb</em>, and <em>Zap Comix</em>, as well as controversial works such as Michael McClure's <em>Beard</em> and Lenore Kandel's <em>Love Book</em>.<br/>
<br/>
 There is also an audiovisual component of the exhibition featuring films about the Summer of Love, bits of performances, and music.</p>
<p>Poetry, theater, and news reports from mainstream and alternative sources additionally provide multiple perspectives on the phenomenon of the Summer of Love and the role of the Grateful Dead.<br/>
<br/>
 Remak-Honnef noted that all of the special collections at McHenry Library are open for research and accessible to the public.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;In contrast to museums, where visitors view materials selected for exhibition, patrons may come to Special Collections and choose what they would like to look at or study,&#8221; she observed. &#8220;We encourage students, faculty, and outside researchers to make use of the collections highlighted in this exhibit.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The exhibit will be on display through June of 2018. Admission is free and open to the public during regular library hours.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8f399a6f807270177c20a6478396aab4"><name>highway-construction</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Long delays expected on Highway 17 for emergency paving</title><summary>Caltrans will perform emergency grinding and paving operations  from Monday through Friday. &#13;

<p>On Friday alone, there are 18 departmental or organizational celebrations scheduled throughout the day, resulting in hundreds of visitors needing on-campus parking. Parking in the East Remote lot will be free on Friday to accommodate many of them. However, traffic on campus will be much heavier than usual, and parking for some celebrations will be in centrally-located parking lots. Please consider coordinating with your supervisor to work off-site or from home on Friday, or consider using alternative transportation to get to campus. Metro buses serving the UCSC campus will be fare-free on Saturday and Sunday. Campus shuttles will be operating on the summer intersession Loop bus schedule (starting at 7:30 a.m.) on Friday, with added evening Loop buses operating until 10 p.m. During the weekend campus Loop shuttle service will operate from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>If you routinely park on campus with a valid UCSC parking permit, you should be able to park in the lot you normally use on Friday. Display your permit as usual, and please don't park in spaces reserved for VIPs, "Special Pass" holders, or disabled visitors.</p>
<p>Additionally, Caltrans will be <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/06/highway-construction.html" target="_blank">repairing parts of Highway 17 this week</a>. In particular, the southbound No. 2 (right) lane of Highway 17 from Sims Road to Pasatiempo Drive will be closed from 9:30 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Friday.</p>
<p>If you will be on campus during the weekend, please be aware that traffic restrictions will be in place on Hagar Drive, which will be closed in the downhill direction from Steinhart Drive to the East Remote parking lot. If you will be leaving campus from the west side or campus core, please use Coolidge Drive, as Heller Drive may be heavily impacted with commencement ceremony traffic.</p>

 <br/>
 During a panel discussion, four participants will revisit research on fascism that Goldfrank published in the 1970s.<br/>
 <br/>
 Kaylin Bourdon of the University of San Diego will discuss "Immigration, Reimagining the White Republic, and Waves of Fascism."<br/>
 <br/>
 Chris Chase-Dunn of UC Riverside will address "The Global Right in the World Revolutions of 1917 and 20xx: Reflections on the Analysis of W. L. Goldfrank on Fascism and the Global Political Economy." <br/>
 <br/>
 And Tom Reifer of UC Riverside will discuss "Polanyi&#8217;s Double-Movement, the Origins of Fascism, and Possible Contemporary Resurgences: Rethinking Walter Goldfrank&#8217;s Insights in the 21st Century."<br/>
 <br/>
 Jonathan Simon of UC Berkeley will chair the session.<br/>
 <br/>
 Goldfrank joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1968. His interests include global political economy with special attention to the rise and decline of nations; social movements and revolutions; export agriculture and its impact on environmental and social conditions; and social change. He retired in 2009.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

<p>Established in 2002, the annual award is named in honor of emeritus professor John Dizikes, one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding faculty members. It is designed to celebrate the Humanities faculty&#8217;s commitment to excellence in teaching and its transformative impact on undergraduate students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bettina Aptheker is truly an icon on this campus,&#8221; noted humanities dean Tyler Stovall in his introduction. &#8220;She has always exemplified everything UC Santa Cruz is, and should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently named as the inaugural chair of the new <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/05/bettina-feminist-chair.html"><strong><em>Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies</em></strong><strong><em>,</em></strong></a> Aptheker has taught one of the country&#8217;s largest and most influential introductory feminist studies courses to more than 10,000 students during her 37 years as a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I invite everyone--regardless of who they are or where they come from--to look critically and fully at their lives,&#8221; said Aptheker about her teaching philosophy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so much what they think; I just want them to think.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>In addition to being honored</strong> with a check for $3,000, the faculty winner is also entitled to select an undergraduate student to receive a $3,000 scholarship. Aptheker chose to split the prize between three senior graduating students in feminist studies&#8212;Mayra Contreras, Abyan Mama-Farah, and Lara Losel.</p>
<p>"Being in this institution&#160;as a woman of color, there were times where I just wanted to run away and head&#160;back to Los Angeles,&#8221; said Contreras.&#160; &#8220;I felt like I wasn&#8217;t good enough to be&#160;here and that I was&#160;better off at home. I want to thank Bettina for believing in me and inspiring&#160;me to continue my education.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My parents and&#160;my sisters have all sacrificed something for me to be here,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I also want to&#160;thank Bettina for valuing my parents&#8217; lives and their struggles, and for&#160;making&#160;me feel like my parents&#8217; history matters."</p>
<p>A double major in feminist studies and biology, Abyan Mama-Farah told the audience she is planning to pursue a career in medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a student of both biology and feminist studies, feminist studies has served as a refuge intellectually and provided a wonderful community of talented, critical thinkers who inspire me each and every day to keep working,&#8221; said Mama-Farah<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It has also helped me grapple with the deep, ethical questions that are inherently embedded in the doing and making of science,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><strong>The 2017 Humanities Spring Awards</strong> event began with opening remarks by new UC Santa Cruz campus provost and executive vice chancellor, Marlene Tromp, who comes to the campus with an extensive background in the humanities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really proud to be a humanist at a place that cares about humanists&#8217; work, Tromp noted. &#8220;I think humanists do some of the most important work that is happening culturally now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humanists are reshaping the way we understand social justice out in the world,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The decisions we make now have long term effects, and humanists will be, and should be, a big part of those decisions.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a2109ac2807270177c20a6478e0b55f0"><name>jerry-nelson-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Jerry Nelson, pioneering designer of large telescopes, dies at age 73</title><summary>Jerry Nelson, a pioneering astronomer known for his innovative designs for advanced telescopes, died June 10 at his home in Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>Jerry Nelson, segmented-mirror telescopes, Keck Telescopes, Keck Observatory, TMT</keywords><start-date>1497337200000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Jerry Nelson, pioneering designer of large telescopes, dies at age 73</display-name><path>/2017/06/jerry-nelson-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/jerry-nelson-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1497367614812</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1498165092960</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/jerry-nelson_1999-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/jerry-nelson_1999-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jerry-nelson_1999-400.jpg</name><display-name>jerry-nelson_1999-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>110745</file-size><width>400</width><height>462</height></image><image-alt>Jerry Nelson</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/jerry-nelson_1999-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/jerry-nelson_1999-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jerry-nelson_1999-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jerry-nelson_1999-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16802</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jerry Nelson</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jerry Nelson</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/nelson-franklin-medal-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/nelson-franklin-medal-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nelson-franklin-medal-400.jpg</name><display-name>nelson-franklin-medal-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>125536</file-size><width>400</width><height>560</height></image><image-alt>Jerry Nelson with Franklin Medal</image-alt><image-caption>Nelson received the Franklin Medal at a ceremony on campus in 2012.

Arvizu)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jerry Nelson, a pioneering astronomer known for his innovative designs for advanced telescopes, died June 10 at his home in Santa Cruz. He was 73.</p>
<p>A professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, Nelson was project scientist for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and had served as project scientist for the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii from 1985 through 2012.</p>
<p>Nelson conceived the revolutionary segmented mirror design of the Keck Observatory's twin 10-meter telescopes, and he developed new techniques to fabricate and control the mirror segments. Each telescope has an array of 36 hexagonal segments, precisely aligned to act as a single reflective surface. This design has since been used for other large ground-based telescopes, and the next-generation James Webb Space Telescope also has a segmented primary mirror design.</p>
<p>Nelson also played an important role in the development of adaptive optics technology, which sharpens the images from ground-based telescopes by correcting for the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere. As founding director of the Center for Adaptive Optics, a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center based at UC Santa Cruz, Nelson helped pioneer the use of adaptive optics in astronomy.</p>
<p>Claire Max, director of UC Observatories and the Bachman Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UCSC, said Nelson was a renowned figure in the international astronomy community. "Jerry's impacts on the field of astronomy and astrophysics are legendary, and we will all benefit from his legacy for many years to come. He was a wonderful colleague and mentor to many of us," she said.</p>
<p>Nelson earned his B.S. in physics at the California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in physics at UC Berkeley. From 1970 to 1981, he worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and he was a professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley from 1981 until 1994, when he moved to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Much of Nelson's early research was in the area of high-energy physics and astrophysics. He analyzed the results of particle accelerator experiments and studied high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as pulsars using innovative astronomical instruments of his own design.</p>
<p>Nelson presented the concepts that led to segmented-mirror telescopes in a series of papers and technical reports starting in 1977, often working with UC colleagues Terry Mast and Gary Chanan. The largest telescopes at that time had been fashioned by polishing a single glass "blank" to the requisite precision of a small fraction of the wavelength of visible light. In order to maintain that surface, the polished mirrors had to be very thick and were therefore heavy, which was a problem for larger mirrors. Nelson's idea was to create a single, high-precision optical surface by supporting individual hexagonal mirrors in a close-packed honeycomb configuration. Making this concept a reality required a series of innovative ideas for fabrication, measurement, and control of the mirror segments.</p>
<p>Nearly twice the diameter and four times the light-gathering capacity of the previous largest ground-based telescopes, the twin Keck Telescopes had an enormous impact on astronomy and astrophysics research.</p>
<p>"The segmented-mirror design will be seen as one of the major turning points in telescope technology and one that opened the path to much larger telescopes on the ground and in space in the coming decades," said Michael Bolte, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Bolte, who serves on the TMT Board of Directors, said the TMT's 30-meter primary mirror design is essentially a scaled up version of the Keck primary mirrors.</p>
<p>After suffering a stroke in 2011, Nelson coped with significant physical limitations but remained deeply engaged in TMT design work. "He was a wonderful colleague. His endless curiosity always pushed the scientists around him to think more deeply, and his persistence and continued excellence after his stroke were inspirational to everyone," Bolte said.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/nelsonfest/index.html">symposium to honor Nelson</a> was already planned for July 13 and 14 in Santa Cruz, featuring talks by many of the eminent astronomers who worked with him over the years. The gathering will now serve as a memorial celebration of his life, Bolte said.</p>
<p>A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Nelson received many awards and honors for his achievements, including the 2010 Kavli Prize in Astrophysics, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering, the Andr&#233; Lallemande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences, and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics of the American Astronomical Society.</p>
<p>Nelson is survived by his wife, Jocelyn Nelson; his sister Jeanne Moat; two children from his first marriage, Leif and Alexandra; and three grandchildren. His first wife Victoria died in 1992.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/jerry-nelson.png</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/jerry-nelson.png</link><site>news</site><name>jerry-nelson.png</name><display-name>jerry-nelson.png</display-name><file-size>82718</file-size><width>295</width><height>140</height></thumb><thumb-alt>JERRY NELSON</thumb-alt><title>JERRY NELSON</title><description>We pay tribute to a pioneering astronomy professor, known for innovative designs for advanced telescopes, who died at his Santa Cruz home June 10. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a25bb696807270177c20a647fa7437d2"><name>in-memoriam-zackory-myers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Zackory Myers</title><summary>Zackory was majoring in Math, loved to ride his bike, and is remembered as always being exceedingly sweet and polite to others.

<p>The students are joining about 6,800 new graduates and professionals who have committed to work two years in rural and urban schools as part of Teach For America. The organization is affiliated with AmeriCorps, the national service network. Participants receive ongoing mentorship and support and earn a full first-year teacher salary from the district they work for. They are also eligible to receive help with student loans and a federal grant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just really excited to get a chance to take what I&#8217;ve learned and become part of this program of going in to difficult schools and trying to provide students with resources that they might not have otherwise,&#8221; said Alison Schmidt (Cowell &#8217;17) who is putting her new political science and economics bachelor&#8217;s degrees to work in a Richmond high school history class. &#8220;I&#8217;m really passionate about civics education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janet Vasquez, (Merrill &#8217;17) an Oakland native who is the first in her family to attend college, is graduating this spring with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Politics/Latin American and Latino Studies and a minor in Education. She&#8217;s returning to her hometown to teach sixth grade math. She hopes to be there long-term. Oakland needs high quality teachers who go beyond just the work in the classroom, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it as a long-term commitment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have a strong connection already built there. I can relate to a lot of what the students are going through. I have the same cultural background.&#8221;</p>
<p>A chief characteristic of TFA recruits is a passion for social justice. &#8220;Every child deserves an excellent education&#8212;one that empowers and supports her to fulfill her potential and realize her greatest dreams,&#8221; according to TFA literature.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the teacher I want to be, the teacher that assumes that everybody has equal potential,&#8221; Schmidt says. &#8220;I want to bring out that potential in whatever way is best for the student and not assume things about the student.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teach For America&#8217;s network of 6,900 teachers grew out of a 1989 Princeton University senior thesis project by Wendy Kopp that proposed a national teacher corps. The organization fielded nearly 49,000 applications from more than 1,900 colleges and universities; about 14 percent of the applicants will be accepted to teach in the program. In the last 25 years, a total of 109 UCSC grads have taught in Teach For America classrooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;When our kids have leaders that look like them and come from the same communities that they come from, it&#8217;s really beneficial for them,&#8221; said Taylor&#160;Weeks, recruitment manager for UCSC and other western colleges. These teachers &#8220;are all very involved on campus in different ways. They&#8217;re all standout leaders and are really committed to expanding opportunities for our kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teachers are certified and credentialed. After the two-year TFA commitment, some teachers stay in education; others go on to work in other fields. The TFA netword includes about 53,000 alumni.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really a leadership development opportunity for UCSC grads to get involved on the front lines of change,&#8221; Weeks says. &#8220;We are recruiting a very diverse group of committed leaders who are interested in expanding opportunities for students who are most in need. The training itself, as a professional opportunity, is next to none. The leadership experience you gain, no matter what you do down the road, prepares you to be a leader.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Schmidt, who has conducted much of her TFA application process via Skype, the last few weeks of her senior year will include final job interviews in between her exams.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obviously terrified that I&#8217;m going to be getting in front of a classroom of 17-year-old teenagers who are the same age as my sister; she never listens to anything I tell her to do,&#8221; Schmidt says. &#8220;But there is so much support. I haven&#8217;t met any of them [the TFA team] yet, but already I feel like I&#8217;m part of this family of really interesting, amazing people.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a2c2df95807270177c20a647c8b97d8c"><name>batalha-natalie-time-100</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Looking for life</title><summary>Alumna Natalie Batalha, who made Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people on Earth, has discovered approximately 4,000 new planets—some of which may turn out to be capable of supporting life.</summary><keywords>Natalie Batalha, NASA, planet hunter</keywords><start-date>1497379200000</start-date><display-name>Looking for life</display-name><path>/2017/06/batalha-natalie-time-100</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/batalha-natalie-time-100</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1497379297616</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1497381982886</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/batalha-natalie.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/batalha-natalie.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>batalha-natalie.jpg</name><display-name>batalha-natalie.jpg</display-name><file-size>12898</file-size><width>202</width><height>311</height></image><image-alt>Natalie Batalha (Ph.D. astrophysics) is one of the world’s foremost planet hunters.

<p>Thirty-five years later, that declaration would land Batalha on <em>Time</em> magazine&#8217;s list of the 100 most influential people on Earth. But the ranking would not be for her philosophical musings.</p>
<p>Instead, Batalha, 50, is one of the world&#8217;s foremost planet hunters, a Marco Polo of the universe whose team has discovered approximately 4,000 new planets, some of which may turn out to be capable of supporting life.</p>
<p>But the need to answer the great philosophical questions about who we are, why we are here, and where we are going, was&#8212;and still is&#8212;at the heart of what Batalha does.</p>
<p>Spend time with Batalha, who earned her Ph.D. in astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, and amid talk of transit photometry and spectroscopic methods, she&#8217;ll speak about how human survivability depends on empathy and how empathy is deepened by knowledge. She&#8217;ll describe how the cells in our bodies were manufactured in the core of stars which, therefore, connects every human on the planet, and talk about the poignancy of the moment she walked out of the redwoods at UC Santa Cruz after a day of studying lifeless planets and was overwhelmed with the idea of the fragility of our existence.</p>
<p>Discovery, she believes, is fundamental to human survival. And, right now, Batalha is at the forefront of a rapidly growing field of knowledge that a UC Santa Cruz astronomer described as &#8220;one wild ride.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Adding up the universe</h3>
<p>The building that houses Batalha&#8217;s office at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center is flanked by a cracked asphalt road called Pioneer Avenue. But that&#8217;s about the only nod to the game-changing work that is going on inside. The concrete structure is a warren of small offices and long fluorescent-lit hallways, with Batalha&#8217;s workspace no different than any other, despite the fact she is lead scientist for one of NASA&#8217;s most significant projects: to find Earth-sized planets that may lead us to an answer of whether we are alone in the universe.</p>
<p>Batalha came to science in a roundabout way. Her teenage pronouncement that she would become a philosopher arrived after she became disillusioned with the Catholic religion she&#8217;d studied and read the 1970 novella, <em>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</em>. The book seeded the idea in her that the way to enlightenment was through the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>Then, she took a physics class.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw the universe could be represented through numbers and equations, it blew me away,&#8221; Batalha says. &#8220;I thought, though mysterious, the universe is not just chaos. It&#8217;s not a collection of meaningless, random events. If we can uncover the secrets of the universe through numbers, then what limits are there to what we can learn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, she hadn&#8217;t planned to be become a scientist. That event happened at a summer internship at the Wyoming Infrared Observatory. On one of Batalha&#8217;s first days there, her faculty advisor handed her a bunch of data concerning a star called HL-Tau and a surrounding disc from which, it was thought, exoplanets could form. The problem was, the information wasn&#8217;t making sense.</p>
<p>By the end of the summer, Batalha had figured out why.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was given a puzzle to solve,&#8221; Batalha says. &#8220;Putting the pieces together was challenging but fun. And just like a puzzle, there was immense gratification when it was solved and you could see the big picture. But here, as often is the case with science, I got to see something that no other human had ever seen before.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Kids enter the equation</h3>
<p>Her life would take another turn, however. By the time Batalha took her last final exam at UC Berkeley and decided to go to graduate school, she was pregnant with her and her husband&#8217;s first child.</p>
<p>What would follow was years of child-rearing&#8212;she has four children&#8212;mixed with the demands of research and her husband&#8217;s own astrophysics career.&#160;</p>
<p>Raising a family while studying the stars was not easy. Even though her professors at UC Santa Cruz were accommodating, there were missed conferences, unconventional hours, and summers spent with her children instead of doing research, she says.</p>
<p>Still, her then-advisor, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Astronomy Steve Vogt, who built a planet-hunting spectrometer that was mounted on the 10-meter Keck-I telescope in Hawaii, remembers her talent and drive. Given only a small window of time to use the powerful instrument to Doppler-image stars, Batalha figured out which stars were amenable to being imaged in a short amount of time and how it could be done.</p>
&#8220;By golly, she lowered her head and muscled through it and made a fine project out of it (the imaging),&#8221; he says.&#160;<br/>
<h3>Beautiful discovery</h3>
<p>Then, chance stepped in.</p>
<p>As Batalha tells it, she was sitting in the office of Gibor Basri, a professor of astrophysics at UC Berkeley and a member of her doctoral thesis committee, when she noticed a report on his desk from a NASA Ames scientist about a new way to detect Earth-sized planets circling other stars.</p>
<p>Called transit photometry, it measured the brightness of a star and then looked for dimmings that would indicate the presence of an Earth-sized planet as it orbited the star. Batalha, who had been studying magnetic activity and sunspots on young stars, wondered how the method could distinguish between sunspots and planets and promptly wrote the scientist a letter.</p>
<p>By February 2000, she was working with the NASA Ames team on that question, and by the next year, a plan to launch a space telescope called Kepler, which used transit photometry, was given the go-ahead thanks to her help. She also won a teaching position at San Jose State University about the same time.</p>
<p>Batalha gets up and begins to sketch a wave of disordered dots on her office whiteboard, describing the moment she and other Kepler scientists realized they&#8217;d accomplished what they set out to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brightness measurements looked like beads on a string,&#8221; she says, drawing a line of more distinct dots through the chaotic scattering to mark the spot where a star&#8217;s light dimmed. &#8220;At that scale, you couldn&#8217;t see the measurement noise. It was just beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even more &#8220;beautiful&#8221; was the team&#8217;s discovery in 2015 of an Earth-sized planet orbiting a star in what is known as the &#8220;Goldilocks Zone,&#8221; the sweet spot where a planet is just the right distance from its star so that liquid water might pool on the surface. Two to three dozen similar planets have now been discovered.</p>
<p>So, is there intelligent life out there?</p>
<p>Batalha says she hopes there is but it may be up to her eldest daughter, an astrophysicist who is also studying exoplanets, to answer.</p>
<p>Batalha lays out upcoming NASA undertakings: a project to help characterize the atmosphere of the most promising planets and, later, another space-based telescope that can look at the surface structure of these planets to determine if they might be habitable. The latter wouldn&#8217;t launch until 2030.</p>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be at retirement age by then,&#8221; Batalha says and smiles. &#8220;Luckily, my daughter will be able to pick up where I leave off.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a34f8b84807270177c20a647a5a564a2"><name>farm-cart</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Farm &amp; Garden’s Market Cart produce stand opens June 20</title><summary>Celebrate the start of summer on Tuesday, June 20, when the Farm &amp; Garden’s Market Cart opens for 2017.</summary><keywords>farm, cart, CASFS, market, produce, organic, sale</keywords><start-date>1497337200000</start-date><display-name>Farm-Cart</display-name><path>/2017/06/farm-cart</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/farm-cart</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1497388516838</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1497388940822</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mt</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/farm-cart_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/farm-cart_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-cart_400.jpg</name><file-size>59054</file-size><width>400</width><height>260</height></image><image-alt>Photo of produce for sale at the Market Cart</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/farm-cart_thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/farm-cart_thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-cart_thumb.jpg</name><file-size>4545</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of produce for sale at the Market Cart</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Beginning June 20, the Market Cart at the base of campus will be open from noon to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Celebrate the start of summer on Tuesday, June 20, when the Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s Market Cart opens for 2017, marking another abundant season of fresh, delicious organic produce and beautiful flowers.

<p>Jerry was known worldwide for his innovative telescope designs. He was the first to propose the revolutionary segmented mirror design of Keck Observatory's twin 10-meter telescopes, and his legacy will live on in the planned Thirty Meter Telescope.</p>
<p>Jerry had been with us on campus since 1994&#8212;he also was founding director of our Center for Adaptive Optics&#8212;and was among those who contributed to the international acclaim of our Astronomy and Astrophysics Department. His work empowered astronomers throughout UC system. I truly believe he owns a piece of all discoveries made on the Keck telescopes over the past 20 years. His design was genius.<br/>
<br/>
The honors he received are considered the most prestigious in his field: membership in the National Academy of Sciences, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering, and the Kavli Prize in Astrophysics, which is astronomy&#8217;s Nobel Prize.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry was also a good friend&#8212;personable, collegial, and modest for someone of such renown. I will miss our conversations, his easy-going smile, and those loud Hawaiian shirts he always wore.<br/>
<br/>
He will be dearly missed by his wife Jocelyn, his family, friends, colleagues, and students.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/nelsonfest/index.html">symposium</a> to honor Nelson was already in the works for July 13-14 in Santa Cruz, and will feature talks by many of the eminent astronomers who worked with him over the years. The gathering will now serve as a memorial celebration of his life.</p>
<p>Ad Astra, Jerry.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a995da80807270177c20a6475cf53ebc"><name>active-shooter-training</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual training exercise for active shooter, June 19 to 2</title><summary>A training exercise sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Police Department will be held from June 19 to 23 at the Division of the Arts complex (Baskin Visual Arts and Theater Arts complexes).

<p>First, though, I have some sad news to share. A student passed away at the start of finals week. Zackory Myers was a mathematics major who loved to ride his bike. He is remembered by friends and family as someone exceedingly sweet and polite who touched the lives of many through his humor and an ability to share his understanding of math. We mourn his loss. We encourage students who wish to speak with someone to contact Counseling and Psychological Services at <a href="tel:831-459-2628">831-459-2628</a>. Faculty and staff may call the Employee Assistance Program at <a href="tel:866-808-6205">866-808-6205</a>.</p>
<h2>Campus accomplishments</h2>
<p>At the end of this month, we are ending the largest fundraising campaign we have ever undertaken, and it can only be described as an overwhelming success! Drawing support from more than 57,000 donors, the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz has surpassed its fundraising target, reaching $320 million. It's done so well we're wrapping it up six months early. Important work all across campus is benefiting from the generosity of our friends and alumni.</p>
<p>Our campus's diverse strengths were on display over the past year for the world to see.</p>
<p>We were ranked fourth worldwide for research influence, landing us in the company of UC Berkeley, Stanford University, MIT and St. George's University of London. Showing our range, we also were chosen as one of the country's best colleges for undergraduate film majors, and the campus's graduate and undergraduate programs in computer game design were rated among the nation's best.</p>
<p>Our faculty, meanwhile, continue to be recognized for paradigm-changing work. This year saw faculty bestowed with some of the highest honors in their fields. Among them:</p>
<p>Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology, won the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. His discoveries surrounding ribosomes have shed light on fundamental questions about the origins of life.</p>
<p>Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics, was awarded the Gruber Cosmology Prize in recognition of a body of work that has helped establish foundational principles underlying our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>Julie Guthman, a leading scholar on the history and geography of California agriculture, had a fantastic year, earning both Guggenheim and Radcliffe Institute fellowships.</p>
<p>John Thompson, Jean H. Langenheim Professor of Plant Ecology and Evolution, took home the Darwin-Wallace Medal, one of the top international prizes in evolutionary biology, for research that has shaped our grasp of evolutionary processes.</p>
<p>Climate scientist Jim Zachos was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, one of the highest honors a U.S. scientist can receive.</p>
<p>Politics professor Sikina Jinnah's 2017 Carnegie Fellowship was fantastic news, and especially great in that it followed professor Mark Massoud's in 2016, also in politics. The department has become a powerhouse.</p>
<p>We as a campus can take great pride in these tremendous honors.</p>
<p>Great faculty is only part of a vital equation, though. Our educators strive to instill in students a passion for learning and for creating a better world&#8212;and our alumni are the ultimate barometers of our success. That's why it's extremely gratifying to see what alumni like Natalie Batalha and Carmen Perez are accomplishing.</p>
<p>Natalie, lead scientist for NASA's Kepler Mission, was named one of Time Magazine's "100 Most Influential People in the World 2017." She is leading the search for Earth-size planets beyond our solar system.</p>
<p>Carmen was co-organizer of January's Women's March, the largest social-justice demonstration on U.S. soil in decades. The themes of the march included equity, inclusion and empowering marginalized communities&#8212;all tenets of our campus!</p>
<p>Student accomplishment</p>
<p>Our students are also leading through innovation.</p>
<p>John Felts, a grad student in electrical engineering, took second place in this year's UC-wide Grad Slam competition with his presentation on Cruz Foam. His Earth-friendly alternative to the environmentally toxic foam used to make surfboards is made from shrimp shells!</p>
<p>Edmundo Perez, a bioengineering major from Salinas, won this year's Steck Award, which recognizes the most outstanding senior research project.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hundreds of our undergraduates, under the guidance of faculty members, are working in coordination with local community organizations&#8212;on the affordable housing crisis in Santa Cruz County, on Pajaro Valley's water problems, on boosting educational access in low-income communities.</p>
<p>Our staff continues to be some of the best, most dedicated in higher education, constantly looking for innovative ways to aid students and faculty, and to promote the university. Irena Poli&#263;, our Institute for Humanities Research managing director, was the very deserving winner of this year's Outstanding Staff Award for her work advancing the humanities.</p>
<p>And we've kicked off our Staff Mentorship Program, a volunteer effort that pairs experienced UC Santa Cruz staff from all campus units with newer staff seeking to develop themselves professionally.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, alumni, and students are making significant contributions locally, nationally and on the global stage, and I couldn't be more proud.</p>
<p>We've made progress on so many fronts. A new campus provost and executive vice chancellor, Marlene Tromp, has joined us. We're close to completing an overhaul of our historic Quarry Amphitheater. This past fall we opened our Silicon Valley Campus, and we established a new center in Scotts Valley for 300 staffers. We've made great progress on our Student Housing West project, which will net us 3,000 new beds over the next few years. And we're looking well into the future &#8212; 2040 &#8212; with the start of our new Long-Range Development Plan. I can't remember a time with so much unfolding simultaneously.</p>
<p>Student interest in campus, meanwhile, continues to skyrocket. Undergraduate applications for fall 2017 again reached an all-time high, and we saw a good jump in diversity numbers, too, with increases in African-American; Asian-American and Pacific Islander; and Latino applicants. More than a third of our applicants come from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. These are gratifying numbers, proof that UC Santa Cruz continues to be about access and opportunity for a diverse group of Californians.</p>
<h2>Great news for intercollegiate athletics</h2>
<p>Finally, I am elated that students overwhelmingly supported the recent campus measure to put our intercollegiate athletics program on a sustainable path forward. Intercollegiate athletics at UC Santa Cruz now have a bright future. I commend the campus community, the student athletes, EOP leadership, the Senate special committee, our alumni, and our foundation board members for all their hard work in supporting athletics. What a wonderful capstone to the year.</p>
<p>In closing, I offer congratulations to our graduates and urge you to keep in touch. You're leaving campus but joining a powerful network of more than 100,000 alumni, many of whom are eager to help new graduates.

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Candy Martinez, a doctoral candidate in Latin American and Latino Studies, has received a Fulbright grant to study how indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico, define and cope with trauma.<br/>
 <br/>
 Support from the <a href="http://www.cies.org/">Fulbright Scholar Program</a> will allow Martinez to spend nine months in Oaxaca, where she will conduct ethnographic interviews with members of the Zapotec and Mixtec communities. She is investigating connections between trauma and modern social inequalities, including involuntary migration, exploitation of natural resources, sexual abuse, and gender inequalities.<br/>
 <br/>
 At the center of her research are <em>la tiricia</em> and <em>susto</em>, illnesses associated in Oaxaca with perpetual sadness and lethargy. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have two big questions: Is <em>tiricia</em> ever associated with migration, and if so, what do people say about how <em>tiricia</em> and migration impact each other?" explained Martinez. "And how do indigenous communities in Oaxaca practice healing in relation to sadness and pain caused by migrating or being left behind?"<br/>
 <br/>
 Martinez hopes to conduct in depth interviews with 20-30 Mixtecs and Zapotecs who possess knowledge <em>la tiricia</em> or <em>susto</em>. She also plans to observe indigenous medicine and healing practices, including sweat baths and other rituals, as part of her project. "It's heavy stuff," said Martinez. "That's why I want to balance learning about trauma with learning about healing."<br/>
 <br/>
 Martinez will incorporate her findings into her dissertation on Oaxacan cultural memory, trauma, and healing. "I'm so grateful for this support from the Fulbright program," said Martinez. "And yet, I'm deeply concerned about proposed cuts to the program."<br/>
 <br/>
 Martinez has spent the last two summers in Oaxaca. During one summer, she volunteered with an organization, Campamento Audiovisual Itinerante, that screened community-centered films, and sponsored workshops and outings. Martinez plans to host screenings of films that portray trauma stemming from social phenomena like poverty and forced migration as a way to draw community members into her project. She is looking forward to an extended stay that will allow her to develop relationships that will enrich her research. "There is scholarship about <em>tiricia</em>, but not about the Mixtec community's knowledge about this illness or how they respond to it," she added.<br/>
 <br/>
 Much of the existing academic literature examines the way neoliberal North American policies in the last 30 years have impacted the migration of Mixtec and Zapotec groups, causing many to migrate unwillingly, said Martinez. Recent literature has clearly demonstrated that migration deteriorates the mental health of Oaxacan communities. <br/>
 <br/>
 Martinez, who earned a B.A. in psychology and Spanish from Amherst College, calls the doctoral program in Latin American and Latino Studies "one of a kind." She plans to pursue a career in academia. Martinez will teach an LALS class on race, class, and gender this summer before leaving for Oaxaca in September.<br/>

personalized graduation caps, including this one, were out in force.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Commencement weekend at UC Santa Cruz was a time to celebrate, reflect, take in inspirational speeches and pay tribute to friends and mentors. </article-subhead><article-text><p>Hand-decorated and lovingly accessorized graduation caps were out in force during UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s commencement activities held June 16-18 on campus.</p>
<p>Festooned with family photos, slogans, and decals shaped like flowers and balloons, these hats stood out on a bright and sweltering weekend, when three thousand people donned heavy black robes in spite of the 80-degree weather. &#8220;In the end she persisted,&#8221; read the message on the cap of an Oakes College undergraduate. Other hats said &#8220;Education, not deportation&#8221; and &#8220;Thanks for loving me.&#8221;</p>
<p>These DIY adornments added a personal touch to the ceremonies. &#160;More than 4,800 UC Santa Cruz students were set to receive undergraduate and graduate degrees for work completed during the 2016&#8211;2017 academic year. A total of 4,170 students were candidates for bachelor degrees for work completed in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences.</p>
<p><strong>The personal is political</strong></p>
<p>The caps, like many of the weekend&#8217;s keynote addresses, perfectly blended the personal with the political. Graduate student Marguerite Kalhor (digital arts and new media), lining up on Friday to receive her MFA, rocked a cap that had a piece of Iranian currency, a photograph of her parents, and an image of the artist and provocateur Marcel Duchamp fixed to her hat.</p>
<p>Kalhor, a fourth-generation American whose ancestors hail from Japan and Iran, emphasized that she used no glue to fix the decorations to her cap. &#8220;It&#8217;s a rental,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to keep it pristine. That&#8217;s why I used binder clips instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexandra Goncharova, in the moments before she lined up to receive her masters of education on Friday, explained the Latin phrase on her cap: &#8220;Factis Non Verbo,&#8221; which means &#8216;facts, not words.&#8217;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, if you are a teacher, words mean a lot, but the deeds that come with those words are even more important,&#8221; Goncharova said. &#8220;The social community-building aspect of the classroom&#8212;teaching students to be kind, hard-working people&#8212;is essential.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Respect, quirk, and intellectual heft</strong></p>
<p>One of the weekend&#8217;s emotional highlights was the Merrill College commencement address by Kris Perry (Merrill &#8217;86, psychology and sociology), the plaintiff in a lawsuit that challenged, and eventually overturned, Proposition 8, a 2008 California constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages.</p>
<p>Perry&#8217;s speech touched again and again on the lessons she learned at UC Santa Cruz, and how inspirational professors helped prepare her for the political fight of a lifetime. &#8220;When it came time to register for classes, I rushed to enroll in Candace West&#8217;s <em>Language and Gende</em>r class, Bettina Aptheker&#8217;s <em>Feminism 101,</em> Elliot Aronson&#8217;s <em>Cognitive Dissonance</em> and later Bill Domhoff&#8217;s <em>Political Power</em>. I was intellectually challenged in ways that still cause me to feel great awe, but back then gave me more than one moment of anxiety."</p>
<p>Perry closed with a bit of wisdom that doubled down on the personal-is-political theme: &#8220;I hope your personal beliefs and passions will be hopelessly intertwined with your careers and vice versa. &#8230; Life is work and work is life. And never forget to make love a part of both. Love was the driving force behind the decision my wife and I made to sue the state of California to overturn Proposition 8 in the spring of 2009.&#8221;</p>
<p>On another personal note, Perry mentioned she was delivering her remarks just a few hours before watching her son, Elliott Perry, receive his bachelor&#8217;s degree from Rachel Carson College.</p>
<p>Crown College students heard from John Laird (Stevenson,, &#8217;72, politics) secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency and former state assemblyman, who was honored to address the crowd during Crown&#8217;s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary year.</p>
<p>Laird gave students advice that applied to their lives and careers. &#8220;Start saving for retirement now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Interview your parents and grandparents about family stories. They won&#8217;t always be here, and you will thank yourself when it matters more to you later in life.&#160; They have amazing stories&#8212;some about their parents and grandparent&#8217;s lives&#8212;that won&#8217;t survive unless you interview them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also urged them to take big risks, recalling his time as the mayor of Santa Cruz. &#8220;You won&#8217;t get to success by always playing it safe,&#8221; Laird said. &#8220;In 1983, I became one of the first openly gay mayors in the United States. I knew I was right by being clear about who I was, and I was hoping to change things by making that statement.&#160; But I didn&#8217;t know if I was on the right side of history. In 2013, I got an award at the White House for being a champion of change. I was on the right side of history.&#160; But it was a big risk in the early 1980&#8217;s, and I am now glad I took it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nicole Lee (Oakes, &#8217;98), executive director of Urban Peace Movement, a youth development program dedicated to transforming the culture and conditions that lead to urban violence, fired up the Oakes crowd during her commencement remarks. &#160;She described her time at Oakes as a kind of awakening. &#8220;This is the place where I started to become a critical thinker and where I started to understand the world outside of Oakland, where I grew up,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was here that I began to find my voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee was heartened to see the diversity of the crowd. &#8220;I&#8217;m so moved,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I started here at Oakes in 1994, my class was not as diverse as yours is. Every day here in California and in this country, we become more and more diverse. This country is wrestling with what to do about that. Should we go boldly toward the future or try to turn the clock back to a different time? But here in California we can see that the train has already left the station. It left a long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee ended on a note of perseverance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black, White, Latino, Trans, LGBTQ, all living together, struggling to figure it out, sharing and exchanging, and learning from each other, scares some people,&#8221; Lee continued. &#8220;But, my fellow Californians, we are the writing on the wall. We are the future that is already here, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. They will try but it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Time for reflection</strong></p>
<p>During the build-up to commencement, UC Santa Cruz undergraduates reflected on the ways they had changed and grown since arriving on campus as first years.</p>
<p>For some students, the 2016-2017 academic year felt like stepping into a time warp; how had the four years passed so quickly?</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize that I was suddenly an upperclassman&#8212;one of <em>those</em> people,&#8221; said Krystin Pahia (Crown, bioengineering, &#8217;17) during the Alumni Welcome Barbecue, a special send-off for seniors that took place a week before commencement. &#8220;Uh oh, it&#8217;s time to grow up. I&#8217;m an adult now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The first in her family to receive a college degree, Pahia found her major overwhelming at first. But soon she came to an important decision: &#8220;If I didn&#8217;t challenge myself now, I would not challenge myself later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pahia decided to push herself because she was fascinated in her topic of study: developing antibodies to fend off the viruses that afflict flowers.</p>
<p>Pahia described the flavor of her emotions as a fourth year about to receive her diploma: &#8220;Sweet and sour,&#8221; she said. Knowing she is about to graduate was &#8220;a slap in the face&#8221; because it seemed so sudden. Then again, &#8220;It also feels like a slap in the back because I&#8217;m proud. It&#8217;s a sweet feeling, but it&#8217;s also sour, like the Sour Patch Kids Commercial: First they&#8217;re sour, then they&#8217;re sweet!&#8221;</p>
<p>As graduation neared, seniors found themselves drifting back to their first moments at UC Santa Cruz, taking it all in, feeling a little overwhelmed. Karla Martinez (College 9, molecular, cell and developmental biology) grew up in San Francisco, and admits to a bit of &#8220;culture shock&#8221; when she moved from a good-sized city into &#8220;the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It definitely took a minute&#8221; to get used to her new surroundings, Martinez said. &#8220;I would walk out of the dorm and see deer, raccoon, foxes, no mountain lions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ethan Greene (Stevenson, politics and legal studies, &#8217;17) remembers finding his academic niche after switching majors. He felt a bit out of place as a computer science major.&#160; Many of his classmates already had extensive programming experience dating back to their high school years. At first he resisted the idea of switching majors. &#8220;It felt like quitting on something,&#8217;&#8217; he said. But when he took an aptitude test at the UC Santa Cruz career center, &#8220;counter-terrorism and government/legal jobs kept coming up.</p>
<p>His schedule was grueling at times, but Greene thrived, earning A&#8217;s, honors and awards. He found that he enjoyed a vigorous debate in which people challenge each other &#8220;but without getting mad at each other and disliking each other for the opinions they hold.&#8221; The discipline and focus of debate has not changed Greene&#8217;s political opinions, &#8220;but I have a much better understanding of why I hold them.&#8221;</p>

Ruby Rich will be celebrated this week at the <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk">Barbican Centre</a> in London. <br/>
 <br/>
 Titled <em>Being Ruby Rich</em>, the four-day event will pay tribute to Rich&#8217;s work through multiple film screenings and panel discussions. Rich will also deliver the keynote address.<br/>
 <br/>
 The event is the brainchild of Selina Robertson and Sophie Mayer of Club des Femmes, now celebrating 10 years of organizing feminist/queer film events in London. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;They are amazing women,&#8221; said Rich. &#8220;I did not know them, never met them before, but was amazed by Mayer's book, <em>Political Animals</em>, a fierce shout-out to feminist filmmaking today. It's been a huge pleasure and honor.&#8221;<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 During her visit to London, Rich will also attend a one-day symposium in her honor titled <em>Being Ruby Rich: Film Curation as Advocacy and Activism</em>, presented by Birkbeck, University of London. <br/>
 <br/>
 As a film critic, Rich has been a programmer and juror at major film festivals around the world and has been published in <em>The Guardian (UK)</em>, <em>The Village Voice</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em>. She has also provided film commentary for NPR&#8217;s <em>All Things Considered</em> and the Criterion Collection.<br/>
 <br/>
 In 2012, she received the Frameline Award at the 36th San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival, an honor awarded annually to a person who has made a major contribution to LGBT representation in film, television, or the media arts.<br/>
 <br/>
 In a recent interview with Sophie Mayer, Rich explained what first drew her to film and feminism.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Film for me was a zone of sociality, a place as much as an idea, a way to constitute community,&#8221; said Rich. &#8220;When the women&#8217;s movement began to flourish and I was swept up into the planning of a women&#8217;s film festival, cinema in a way became my gateway drug into feminism. And there was no turning back: from then on, those worlds definitely began to blur and merge and influence each other so much they became inseparable.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Rich also spoke with Mayer about the current need for a &#8220;cinema of urgency.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;New times demand new visions,&#8221; Rich noted. &#8220;We need new film languages and rhetorics. I think film is really lagging behind, actually--it needs to be addressing the issues in people&#8217;s lives, the changing oppressions as well as the changing dreams and ambitions. And there needs to be a shift of style and way of engaging audiences. People are in need and audiences are ready for change. Can&#8217;t all happen at the polling places!&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 Rich is the author of several books on film, including <em>New Queer Cinema: The Director's Cut</em>, and&#160;<em>Chick Flicks: Theories and Memories of the Feminist Film Movement</em>.<br/>
 <br/>
 She is also the editor of <em>Film Quarterly</em>, the academic film journal of the University of California Press. Established in 1958, the peer-reviewed journal examines all aspects of film history, film theory, and the impact of film, video and television on culture and society.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/05/rich-lincoln-center.html</url><title>UCSC film professor celebrates release of new book at Lincoln Center</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/queer-cinema-lectures.html</url><title>B.

 <br/>
 New research into the behavior of these big cats indicates that they don't like encountering humans any more than we like bumping into them on hiking trails. The findings are particularly valuable as human development encroaches on lion habitat and drives up the number of human-puma encounters.<br/>
 <br/>
 "We exposed pumas in the Santa Cruz mountains to the sound of human voices to see if they would react with fear and flee, and the results were striking: They were definitely afraid of humans," said Justine Smith, lead author of the paper "<a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1857/20170433">Fear of the human 'super predator' reduces feeding time in large carnivores</a>," published in the June 21 online edition of the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. <br/>
 <br/>
 Smith, who led the study as a graduate student in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, and her colleagues devised a novel experiment to gauge puma behavior: Her team placed audio equipment at puma kill sites in the Santa Cruz Mountains; when a puma came to feed, its movements triggered motion-activated technology that broadcast recordings of people talking, and a hidden camera captured the puma's responses. They broadcast recordings of Pacific tree frog vocalizations as a control.<br/>
 <br/>
 "We found that pumas almost always ran from the sound of humans&#8212;and almost never ran from the sound of frogs," said Smith, now a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley. In 29 experiments involving 17 pumas, the pumas fled in 83 percent of cases as soon as it heard human voices, and only once upon hearing frogs.<br/>
 <br/>
 In addition to establishing the fear response, the study reveals changes in puma feeding behavior that could have implications for their well-being in human-dominated landscapes&#8212;and their impact on prey populations, particularly deer. The results build on <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/02/puma-kill-rates.html">previous work</a> showing higher kill rates and lower feeding times in more human-populated areas. <br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 "We found that pumas took longer to return to their kills after hearing people, and subsequently reduced their feeding on kills by about half," said Smith. "Those behavioral changes are significant, as our previous work has shown that they cause pumas to increase their kill rates by 36 percent in areas with high human activity."<br/>
 <br/>
 This is the first study to experimentally link the fear of humans to feeding behavior in large carnivores, said Chris Wilmers, associate professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz and a senior author on the study. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Fear is the mechanism behind an ecological cascade that goes from humans to pumas to increased puma predation on deer," said Wilmers, a wildlife ecologist who studies the cascading effects large carnivores can have on their prey. "We're seeing that human disturbance&#8212;beyond hunting&#8212;may alter the ecological role of large carnivores. As we encroach on lion habitat, our presence will likely affect the link between top predators and their prey." <br/>
 <br/>
 The experiment was part of a <a href="http://santacruzpumas.org/">long-term study of puma ecology</a> in the Santa Cruz Mountains that began in 2008. All 17 pumas in this study have housing developments in their home range, and exposure to humans is commonplace. Kill sites were identified with data transmitted from GPS-monitoring collars worn by pumas that have been captured, collared, and released as part of the project. Human voice recordings were broadcast to mimic the natural volume of human conversation.<br/>

For example, studies of a small community in northern Sweden where detailed historical records were kept found correlations between food availability for one generation and the mortality rate for that generation's grandchildren.</p>
<p>But the exact nature of these effects and how they are transmitted across generations remain unclear. In Susan Strome's lab at UC Santa Cruz, research on a tiny roundworm called <em>C. elegans</em> is helping to solve this puzzle. Her latest grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for around $2 million over four years, funds a research proposal that received a perfect score from the reviewers.</p>
<p>"NIH is supporting this basic research in a model organism because it is the only way to crack open the mechanisms behind the correlations seen in human studies. You can't do these kinds of experiments in humans," said Strome, a distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. &#160;</p>
<p>Scientists have long understood how inherited traits are transmitted from generation to generation via the DNA sequences of genes. They have also figured out how genes get turned on or off in different cells, so that different sets of genes are active in liver cells and skin cells, for example. This involves "epigenetic" changes that do not alter the DNA sequence, but add chemical modifications to either the DNA itself or the histone proteins with which DNA is packaged in the chromosomes. Epigenetic changes to gene expression can also result from environmental factors, such as diet or exposure to toxins.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Revolutionary concept</strong></p>
<p>A key question has been whether such changes can be passed across generations. The idea that epigenetic modifications can cause changes in gene expression that are transmitted from one generation to the next is known as "transgenerational epigenetic inheritance." It is a revolutionary concept that remains somewhat controversial despite mounting evidence to back it up.</p>
<p>Strome's lab made a crucial contribution to the field in 2014 with a study demonstrating how epigenetic marks that repress genes can be transmitted across generations through the germ line cells--eggs and sperm--that unite to form a new organism.</p>
<p>"We have developed a very powerful system for studying how epigenetic information gets passed between generations, and it gives us the ability to unravel the mechanisms involved," Strome said.</p>
<p>With the new grant, her lab will address three main questions: What is the nature of the epigenetic information that gets passed across generations, how is inherited epigenetic information propagated and maintained through multiple cell divisions, and what are the consequences?</p>
<p>"We want to create a detailed map of the epigenetic markings in the sperm, in the egg, and in the early embryo. This will enable us to address a number of important questions, such as how does the embryo deal with potentially conflicting marks inherited from the two parents?" Strome said.</p>
<p>She also plans to test whether changes in gene expression caused by a stressful environment can be passed from parents to offspring through epigenetic marks. Using exposure to alcohol as the stressor, the researchers will profile gene expression patterns and epigenetic markers in stressed and non-stressed worms, and then look at the consequences in their offspring.</p>
<p>This is a particularly exciting area of research that is being pursued at many different levels, including studies of human populations and experiments in mice and rats. Some of these studies suggest that the effects of extreme stress can be passed on, causing offspring or "grand-offspring" to be more prone to anxiety or mental illness. But these studies can be difficult to interpret, and working with a simpler organism enables Strome's lab to explore the role of epigenetics at the molecular level.</p>
<p>"The lessons we learn from our worm studies can help us make sense of the results of experiments with vertebrate models and studies of human populations," Strome said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cc4ecac0807270177c20a647d46bde5a"><name>wilmers-leopard</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>African leopards revealed: Study documents minute-to-minute behavior of elusive cats</title><summary>The elusive behavior of the African leopard has been revealed in great detail for the first time as part of a sophisticated study that links the majestic cat's caloric demands and its drive to kill. </summary><keywords>wilmers, leopard, ecology, prey, kill, energetics, environmental study, africa</keywords><start-date>1498028400000</start-date><display-name>Wilmers-Leopard</display-name><path>/2017/06/wilmers-leopard</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/wilmers-leopard</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1498076333387</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1498675796386</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/wilmers-leopard_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/wilmers-leopard_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wilmers-leopard_400.jpg</name><file-size>49173</file-size><width>400</width><height>249</height></image><image-alt>Photo of an African leopard wearing an accelerometer collar</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/wilmers-leopard-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/wilmers-leopard-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wilmers-leopard-thumb.jpg</name><file-size>7935</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of an African leopard</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>High-tech wildlife tracking collars have helped reveal the behavior of the elusive African leopard for the first time.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The elusive behavior of the African leopard has been revealed in great detail for the first time as part of a sophisticated study that links the majestic cat's caloric demands and its drive to kill.</p>
<p>A team led by Chris Wilmers, associate professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, produced an unprecedented picture of this carnivore's predatory and reproductive behaviors by outfitting the cats with high-tech wildlife tracking collars equipped with GPS technology and an accelerometer to measure energy output.</p>
<p>"This is the first time we've had really detailed energetic data from a wild terrestrial mammal over an extended period," said Wilmers, lead author of a new paper, "<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1850/full">Energetics-informed Behavioral States Reveal the Drive to Kill in African Leopards</a>," which appears today (June 21, 2017) in the online edition of the journal Ecosphere.</p>
<p>The team gathered data from five animals over two months: one adult male; one adult female with one cub; one adult female without cubs; one yearling male cub; and a young "dispersal-aged" male ready to establish his own territory. "The sample size is small, but we got lucky with the diversity of age and sex," noted Wilmers.</p>
<p>Information gleaned from the collars allowed Wilmers' team to match the leopards' behavior with time and place, enabling them to assess the energetic "costs" of reproductive behavior&#8212;dispersal and territorial patrol for males; parenting for females.&#160;</p>
<p>The study revealed that for male African leopards, territorial patrol activities account for 26 percent of their daily caloric intake; for females, parenting a one-year old offspring consumes 8 percent of their calories.&#160;</p>
<p>"Energetics is the ultimate currency for an animal's survival," said Wilmers. "To survive, an animal needs to balance the calories it's expending with the calories it's taking in. If it wants to reproduce, it has to run an energetic surplus."&#160;</p>
<p>Wilmers, a wildlife ecologist who studies animal behavior and its cascading effects on ecosystems, continued: "Based on what the leopards are doing, they run up different energetic budgets, which in turn influence their drive to kill. They might kill more prey, bigger prey, or go after more desirable prey in more dangerous places&#8212;closer to humans, for example."</p>
<p>One of the most striking behaviors described in the study was a kill by the adult male leopard. The data document him approaching a small village in a meandering fashion. He attacks and kills a goat inside a pen, then spends five minutes dragging the goat across the river to a spot where vegetation gives him the cover he needs to begin feeding.&#160;</p>
<p>"It gives us incredible insight into their behavior to see where they are moving and what they're doing on such a fine time scale," said Wilmers. "This allows us to see these cryptic animals moving through their environment."</p>
<p>Another example details the behavior of the adult female with a yearling cub. She kills an aardwolf (a small insect-eating mammal), feeds a bit, then meanders and rests for a few hours until she kills an impala (a medium-sized antelope that is common prey for African leopards). She feeds briefly, then walks directly back to her cub, guiding it first to the aardwolf and then the impala.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wilmers was able to calculate and then compare the energetics of the mother and her son as they traveled together, concluding that the cub expended 12 percent more energy to travel the same distance.</p>
<p>African leopards are among the most elusive mammals on the planet&#8212;more so than African lions or cheetahs. "Their whole strategy is to be elusive," said Wilmers. "People get glimpses of them, but that's all. Looking at this data is like going on a safari for the first time and seeing an animal you've only seen in captivity before."</p>
<p>These fine-grained energetics data open the door to understanding the ecological consequences of the leopard's predatory drive. Knowing the African leopard's energetic needs allows researchers to evaluate where they hunt, what they hunt, and to estimate the level of risk they might be willing to take in pursuit of attractive prey. In combination, these factors have implications for humans and the livestock that often share habitat with African leopards.</p>
<p>The placement of a fence, for example, could have energetic "costs" for leopards if they have to travel farther&#8212;expending more energy&#8212;to patrol territory, hunt, and provide for their offspring. Those costs would increase their drive to kill. "They might take bigger risks, they might catch larger prey like impala, and that could effect the impala population and what they feed on," said Wilmers, outlining the "cascade" of ecosystem effects that could follow human changes to the landscape.</p>
<p>"To be able to link behavior to energetics to ecological effects is an important conceptual advance," said Wilmers. "Once you understand how that circle works, we can assess how our actions will impact the animals, and how those effects will play out on the ecosystem."</p>

<p>While not the best reason to engage in a tug-of-war with a criminal, the 43-year-old Ettinger (Merrill &#8217;95, American literature) had cause to be worried. She was in the midst of doing interviews and collecting information for a book exploring America&#8217;s obsession with ice cream, and the loss of her notes and computer would have been a tough blow.</p>
<p>Luckily for her &#8212; and her readers &#8212; Ettinger was not hurt in the incident and her computer and papers were not in the vehicle, which eventually sped off into the afternoon sun. But the incident shows the kind of ethos Ettinger brought to her just-released book, <em>Sweet Spot: An Ice Cream Binge Across America</em>: a journalistic urge to go for the jugular but also touch the heart of anyone who has ever sighed in pleasure at the first lick of an ice-cold cone on a hot summer day.</p>
<p>Ettinger, who spent a number of years as a newspaper reporter and whose essays have appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Washington Post,</em> began her writing career in fourth grade penning what she laughingly called &#8220;bad sci-fi novels.&#8221; But it was in high school that she got a taste of the direction her life would take.&#160;</p>
<p>Long before Facebook and blogs made public confession a regular practice, Ettinger penned a high school newspaper column recording every bitter detail of a bad breakup. It landed her on the pages of a local newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I got that little bit of attention, I thought, &#8216;This is really fun,&#8217;&#8221; Ettinger said.</p>
<p>Later, while at UC Santa Cruz, she was hired by the <em>San Jose Mercury News</em> to write a monthly, first-person column about life as a 19-year-old college student.</p>
<p>But it was at UC Santa Cruz that, Ettinger said, her writing skills were focused and honed. A class on American novelists Toni Morrison and William Faulkner taught by literature professor Paul Skenazy inspired her &#8220;to want to settle down and learn the craft&#8221; of writing, she said. Another of his courses shifted her focus to exploring memoir &#8212; which eventually led to the idea of her debut book on ice cream, which Shelf Awareness called &#8220;adventurous&#8221; and &#8220;richly entertaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>So many of her childhood memories were tied up with ice cream, Ettinger said as she sat at the kitchen table in the home she now shares with her writer husband Dan White (<em>Under the Stars: How America Fell in Love with Camping</em>) and her 8-year-old daughter Julianna.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the baby of the family with two older brothers,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and it always felt chaotic and loud in my house. TVs were blasting and my brothers would be playing different songs on different musical instruments in the house, and we would be fighting and there was the whole latch-key-kid childhood thing. But when there was a chance to have ice cream we all calmed down and sat at the table and made our own little sundaes and everybody was happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was that idea of telling the history of America&#8217;s favorite frozen treat (the average American eats almost 22 pounds of ice cream per year) while also exploring memories of her own life that led Ettinger to the book and long hours of detailed and experiential research.</p>
<p>She took a wild ride in the back of an ice cream truck in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn; enrolled in the world&#8217;s most famous ice-cream making course at Penn State University; visited a water buffalo dairy that turns out a soft-serve gelato so good it left her weak in the knees; and even forced herself to down cups of frozen yogurt, which she abhors but her daughter loves.</p>
<p>She made gallons of ice cream, designed her own flavors, tasted enough of the frozen dessert to make her feel like she was in training to become a competitive eater.</p>
<p>She also uncovered what she considered an ice-cream heresy: due to strict laws about pasteurization, the majority of ice cream makers &#8212; even artisanal shops &#8212; use a pre-made base to create their mouth-watering concoctions.</p>
<p>Through it all, she never lost her love of ice cream, or its ability to bring back sweet memories.</p>
<p>As Ettinger talked, her daughter burst through the front door, her long red ringlets bouncing as she ran to say hi to her mom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Julianna was with me on a lot of my trips,&#8221; Ettinger said after giving her daughter a squeeze. &#8220;And here I am writing about my own childhood and I realized that my child is with me, and these are going to be the memories she&#8217;ll be transported to when she eats her own ice cream.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is really very tender for me.&#8221;</p>

Knight Foundation.</p>
<p>Concerns about the spread of misinformation and declining trust in the media often focus on how personalized news feeds and search results can create a "filter bubble" or "echo chamber" in which individuals see only information that supports their preconceived ideas about the world. Science communicators see these effects in the continued public controversies over issues such as climate change and childhood vaccines, which are not controversial among scientists.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of concern about whether the rise of social media and fracturing of the media landscape are killing well-informed public discourse," said Erika Check Hayden, director of the Science Communication Program. "We will test whether we can use digital and social media more effectively to promote constructive public dialogue around science."</p>
<p>Hayden will work with <a href="https://www.escapeyourbubble.com/">EscapeYourBubble</a>, a digital platform designed to help people break out of their filter bubbles, to distribute science journalism produced by the graduate students in her program. The students will strive to create engaging science journalism that responds to the concerns of a broader slice of the American public than traditional science journalism has recognized.</p>
<p>The project will also involve training students in concepts of decision science, which examines how people respond to information presented in different contexts. For example, decision science shows that people with fixed beliefs are unlikely to change them unless facts are delivered by a trusted messenger in a culturally relevant context. Studies also show that graphical information is more likely to affect beliefs than text alone.</p>
<p>Hayden's team and EscapeYourBubble will evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches to presenting information about issues such as climate change. They will then use the results of these evaluations to develop guidelines for more effective science journalism. Click-through rates, for example, can reveal how well people respond to different headlines. Follow-up surveys of EscapeYourBubble users will provide more detailed feedback on readers' reactions to the articles.</p>
<p>"Climate change is such a divisive issue that we have hesitated to get into it, but I feel now is a good time to apply some of what we've learned from other domains to this important issue," said EscapeYourBubble founder Krishna Kaliannan.</p>
<p>Kaliannan, who started EscapeYourBubble in November after the presidential election, said it has steadily grown from an initial base of about 5,000 to nearly 20,000 current users. When people sign up, they receive curated content either through their Facebook news feed or by email.</p>
<p>The project will be incorporated into the curriculum for graduate students in the Science Communication Program in the 2017-18 academic year. Hayden said she is looking forward to getting fresh ideas from the students in the program.</p>
<p>"Our students have grown up with digital communications and social media, so it's going to be fun to unleash their creativity and see what ideas they have for communicating about science more effectively," Hayden said.</p>
<p>The project received a $50,000 grant through the <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/20-projects-will-address-the-spread-of-misinformation-through-knight-prototype-fund">Knight Foundation's Prototype Fund</a>, which focuses on technology and media innovation. The fund issued a call in March for ideas to "address concerns about the spread of misinformation and build trust in quality journalism." The UCSC Science Communication Program is among 20 organizations awarded funds through this open call.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://knightfoundation.org/articles/20-projects-will-address-the-spread-of-misinformation-through-knight-prototype-fund</url><title>Knight Foundation Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d140db51807270177c20a647590b4a50"><name>thumbs-up-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2017 Thumbs Up Awards</title><summary>Do you know a staff member who goes above and beyond to help the university?

In that <em>Introduction to Biology</em> course, he learned about viruses and became intrigued with their structure. He found out about how they multiply and mutate, and how they spread from organism to organism.</p>
<p>Now Perez (College 10 &#8216;17, bioengineering) is being recognized for his work on how the human immune system blocks virus infection and disease. He is this year&#8217;s winner of the Steck Family Award, &#160;which honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates.</p>
<p>Loren Steck (Porter '73) was part of the distinguished selection committee that chose to recognize Perez&#8217;s project. The Steck family created the endowment that funds the award.</p>
<p><strong>A drive to work hard</strong></p>
<p>Perez worked for two years in the Baskin School of Engineering lab of Rebecca DuBois, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering. His research culminated in his thesis, &#8220;Structural Studies to Understand Evasion of an Astrovirus serotype-2 subtype to a Potent Neutralizing Antibody.&#8221; Dubois, along with biomolecular engineering graduate student Walter Bogdanoff, guided him along the way.</p>
<p>DuBois&#8217;s research group is dedicated to understanding the molecular mechanisms of virus infections and to use that information to develop vaccines and antiviral therapeutics. Perez&#8217;s focus was on the human astrovirus capsid surface protein. His goal was to understand the virus&#8217;s atomic structure and its interactions with protective antibodies.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this research is to create a vaccine for the virus, which causes gastroenteritis, including diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. It most often affects children, but can also affect elderly adults. Perez wanted to find out how a particular antibody could help stop the virus. To do this, he needed to understand the structure of the virus itself, and then try to pinpoint the place where the protective antibody binds with the virus. His research encompassed molecular biology, protein engineering, and X-ray crystallography techniques.</p>
<p>DuBois attributes Perez&#8217;s research success to several factors, including his drive and a willingness to work hard. &#8220;It can be challenging to be an undergraduate in a research lab,&#8221; DuBois said. &#160;&#8220;Experiments fail, and it can be tempting to want to give up. Ed was never like that. If one of his experiments failed, he wanted to find out what went wrong and how to solve the problem. He had the drive and tenacity to push through hurdles and setbacks, to accept failure as part of the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both DuBois and Bogdanoff expected a lot from Perez, and Perez stepped up to the challenge. &#8220;Edmundo did an amazing job,&#8221; DuBois said.</p>
<p>Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, attended the award luncheon. "Edmundo is absolutely deserving of this award and I am extremely impressed with his academic achievements," Wolf said. "We can all learn from his determination, hard work, and ability to overcome life's challenges."</p>
<p><strong>Finding his passion</strong></p>
<p>Perez found his passion for science during a junior year high school French class. He surprised himself, and his teacher, by excelling in the class. He enjoyed learning the language, and he liked the feeling of success. He began to study more and work harder, which led to better grades. His French teacher noticed the change in Perez and encouraged him to keep working. &#8220;Of all my teachers, she was the one who really encouraged me to go to college,&#8221; Perez said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At some point I realized that if I could do well in French by studying, then maybe I could use this same logic with my other classes,&#8221; Perez continued. &#8220;That&#8217;s when I began to really apply myself, and I started to like math and biology too, and do well in them. I changed my outlook. That&#8217;s really all that changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perez entered Hartnell College in 2011 and then transferred to UC Santa Cruz in 2015. Through the UC Santa Cruz ACCESS program, Perez was able to work in a couple of research labs. When he joined the DuBois lab, Perez said, &#8220;it just felt right. I was still interested in viruses, and that&#8217;s the focus of the research in her lab.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advice for undergraduates? Perez encourages others to &#8220;Reach out to professors. Try to do internships in the summer. If something interests you, try it. Don&#8217;t be shy. If you join a lab, or if you take difficult classes, work hard, go to office hours, put the time in. Go for it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d5fb0de3807270177c20a6474024562b"><name>navarro-hector-podcast</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>First-generation stories: Headed to UCLA to continue cancer research </title><summary>Our podcast catches up with new grad Hector Navarro, a first-generation college student who's off to big things.</summary><keywords>Hector Navarro, UCLA, cancer research, first-generation college student</keywords><start-date>1498201200000</start-date><display-name>First-generation stories: Headed to UCLA to continue cancer research </display-name><path>/2017/06/navarro-hector-podcast</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/navarro-hector-podcast</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1498238617690</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1633027932611</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>StoryCruz</value><value>Diversity</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwendolyn Jourdonnais</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/329675162&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe></embed><width>450</width><caption>Podcast by J.D.

We wrote about him and his inspiring story in 2015. We caught up again with Hector as he graduated from Cowell College this month.</p>
<p>When he was younger, Hector Navarro didn&#8217;t expect much when thinking about his future.</p>
<p>His dad worked on the grounds of Bethany University in Scotts Valley, then headed off to a second job doing small construction projects and home repairs.</p>
<p>Navarro thought he&#8217;d never met a man who worked harder than his father. He&#8217;d think how proud he was of the way his dad had become a citizen and left the strawberry fields for a job that allowed his wife to raise their family of six &#8212; a simple but good life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up thinking, &#8216;I come from humble roots so my life could quite possibly end up the same way,&#8217;&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Then, Navarro found science.</p>
<p>He enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, majoring in molecular, cell and developmental biology, and he worked in a genetics lab on campus with the goal of becoming a cancer researcher some day.</p>
<p>He's now one step closer to that goal&#8212;he's graduated from UC Santa Cruz is off to UCLA for his doctoral degree.</p>
<p>Listen to our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ucsantacruz/first-generation-stories-graduated-and-off-to-ucla-to-continue-cancer-research">podcast</a> about his experiences, the inspiration he drew from his parents, and his words of advice for other first-generation college students.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/navarro-hector.html</url><title>'Doing something significant with my life'</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/hector-navarro.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/hector-navarro.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hector-navarro.jpg</name><display-name>hector-navarro.jpg</display-name><file-size>16701</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>HECTOR NAVARRO</title><description>Hector Navarro is a first-generation college student who's off UCLA to continue his cancer research.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d64f1807807270177c20a647858209e9"><name>lick-summer-series</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lick Observatory kicks off popular Summer Series</title><summary>Natalie Batalha, who earned her doctorate in astrophysics from UC Santa Cruz, was the keynote scientist on the second evening of the 37th annual Summer Series at the Lick Observatory on Mt.

Hamilton last weekend, scientists from NASA and University of California Observatories invited the public to peer into distant worlds. They announced new discoveries of potentially habitable earth-sized planets at the edge of what can be known.&#160;</p>
<p>If our galaxy, the Milky Way, was the size of the United States, one of these planets would be just a few minutes walk from here, said Natalie Batalha, a research astrophysicist for NASA Ames and project scientist for the exoplanet-finding Kepler Mission. It&#8217;s not, of course&#8212;the real size of the galaxy is estimated at between 100,000 and 200,000 light-years in diameter and the distance of one of these Earth-like planets is closer to 10 light-years or 60 trillion miles from the mountaintop.&#160;</p>
<p>Batalha, who earned her doctorate in astrophysics from UC Santa Cruz, was the keynote scientist on the second evening of the <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/summer/">37<sup>th</sup> annual Summer Series</a> at the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, a popular evening program that includes Evening with the Stars on Fridays and Music of the Spheres on Saturdays. Both nights include astronomy lectures and views through the telescopes. Friday programs add lectures on the history of the observatory and its contributions while Saturday programs include live music and, for VIP ticket holders, a walking tour. Tickets for the event, which went on sale in April, sold out within hours.</p>
<p>For visitors, the evening started with a bit of history about the iconic facility, the first observatory built at high elevation that, for many years, harbored the biggest telescope of its kind. For decades it was the world center for observational astronomy.&#160;</p>
<p>On Saturday, VIPs joined a tour with resident astronomer Paul Lynam and Batalha, who was recently named by <em>Time</em> magazine&#160;as one of the world&#8217;s 100 most influential people. The group wound along the ridgetop home of several white, rounded observatory buildings and scientists&#8217; dormitories. They toured the dome of the 3-meter Shane Telescope, the mountain&#8217;s largest telescope, and shared dinner before settling in for some live music. The White Album Ensemble, a popular Beatles cover band, sang &#8220;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&#8221; while the sun set over Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>After Batalha&#8217;s humbling, mind-bending astronomy talk, visitors were invited to peer at Jupiter through the 40-inch Nickel Reflector telescope and at Messier 5, a globular cluster visible through the historic 36-inch Great Lick Refractor telescope.</p>
<h2>Observatory offers hands-on learning</h2>
<p>Lick Observatory, atop 4,265-foot Mt. Hamilton, overlooks the east side of Silicon Valley. It is primarily a research and technology development facility and remains the premier UC training</p>
<p>observatory. It is operated by UCO with headquarters in the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building at UC Santa Cruz. UCO is also a managing partner of Keck Observatory in Hawaii, operates technical labs at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA, and is the center of UC participation in the multinational Thirty Meter Telescope project.</p>
<p>Student astronomers can use the equipment from a remote observation station at UC Santa Cruz, as well as from other stations throughout the UC system, and even from further afield such as Seoul, South Korea. Grad students are eligible to apply for telescope time as principal investigators. From afar, they gain valuable hands-on experience that is difficult to come by anywhere else. This year, UC Santa Cruz researchers have been scheduled to observe, using multiple telescopes and cameras, an average of 20 times per month.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been able to get a lot of observing experience which is really difficult to get on some of the larger sized telescopes,&#8221; said Tiffany Hsyu, a third year UCSC doctoral student. Hsyu is using Lick telescopes remotely to confirm candidate dwarf galaxies that may offer insights into early conditions of the universe. &#8220;Every time I get to use a telescope I think, I&#8217;m one of just few people who get to do this. It&#8217;s pretty awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>New UC Santa Cruz astronomy and astrophysics grad students make an inaugural pilgrimage to the mountain and enjoy an annual student campout atop the mountain as well.</p>
<p>A rich history of discovery connects UC Santa Cruz, a leading center for observational and theoretical research in astronomy and astrophysics, and the Lick Observatory. To name just a few groundbreaking discoveries with significant UC Santa Cruz leadership, there is the Automated Planet Finder instrument project headed by UCSC astronomer Steve Vogt; the major upgrade to the Kast Spectrograph at Lick Observatory, made possible in part through the fundraising work of Michael Bolte, a UCSC professor and former director of UCO; the development of new standards relating to the evolution of galaxies by Sandra Faber, a UCSC astronomy professor and former UCO director; and Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics technologies, created by Claire Max, UCO director and UCSC astronomer.</p>
<p>Up to 200 astronomers are trained annually at Lick Observatory and about 40 scientific papers are published each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re training the next generation of world-class scientists and instrument builders,&#8221; Lynam, said. &#8220;The other facilities are not training observatories. Lick Observatory gives students hands-on time to explore and also to tinker.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event kicked off NASA&#8217;s week-long Kepler conference during which Batalha and the Kepler team announced a catalog of planet candidates, 10 of which are near-Earth size and share several key characteristics that could potentially host microbial life.</p>
<p>Much stargazing also happens outside the observatories, thanks to amateur astronomers who are invited to set up their telescopes in the parking lot so visitors can glimpse into space. From one such telescope, viewers watched three moons circle Jupiter, making hundreds of millions of miles feel not quite so far away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Mr. (James) Lick would be very proud,&#8221; Lynam said, of the benefactor who set up a trust in the 1870s to build the world&#8217;s largest refracting telescope in 1888. It became operational in January 1888, 12 years after Lick&#8217;s death. A completed Lick observatory was donated to UC in June 1888.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

href="https://www.arts.gov"><em><strong>National Endowment for the Arts</strong></em></a> to support their latest documentary film projects.</p>
<p>Associate professor of art <strong>Dee Hibbert-Jones</strong> and assistant professor of film and digital media <strong>Jennifer Maytorena Taylor</strong> are two of 107 recipients nationwide that received 2017 NEA grants in the &#8220;Media Arts&#8221; category.</p>
<p>They join fellow awardees from a wide range of organizations including Public Radio International, Jazz at Lincoln Center, LA Theatre Works, the New York Philharmonic, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Hibbert-Jones and San Francisco artist Nomi Talisman will use the funds to support production and post-production costs for an animated documentary called "De'Juan's Story."</p>
<p>The second film in their "Living Condition" trilogy, it tells the story of a young man whose uncle was on death row and how it has affected his life. The film shows De'Juan at various life stages--from visiting his uncle weekly as a child, to the death of his mother and uncle, to his life as a college student living independently.</p>
<p>The first film in their trilogy, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/jones-oscar-nomination.html"><em><strong>Last Day of Freedom</strong>,</em></a> was nominated for a 2016 Academy Award in the category of best documentary short. The new project will extend the reach of that film, further exploring the crisis in the American criminal justice system through the stories of families with a loved one accused of a capital crime.</p>
<p>Taylor will use her grant to support production and post-production costs for her documentary, &#8220;The Gut.&#8221; Set in Rutland, Vermont, a small blue-collar city recovering from an opioid epidemic, the film follows Mayor Louras and a small ensemble of intersecting characters for two years as he fights to resettle Syrian refugees in the town.&#160;</p>
<p>The documentary explores the different perspectives on the many complex issues facing residents, such as community transitions, economic growth, and change when small-town America meets the Syrian civil war.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Taylor produced one of several short pieces that comprised <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/taylor-pbs-race.html"><strong><em>The Talk: Race in America</em></strong></a>, a new film that premiered on <em>PBS</em>.</p>
<p>She is also the producer and director of the 2015 film <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/carmel-festival-documentary.html"><strong><em>Daisy &amp; Max</em></strong></a>, an hour-long documentary, filmed on location in South Los Angeles, about a couple working to protect LA communities from gang violence that is caught in the crossfire of the U.S. war on gangs.</p>
<p>Established by Congress in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts is an independent federal agency and the only funder in the country to support arts activities in all 50 states.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American people are recognized for their innovative spirit and these grants represent the vision, energy, and talent of America&#8217;s artists and arts organizations,&#8221; said NEA Chairman Jane Chu. &#8220;I am proud of the role the National Endowment for the Arts plays in helping advance the creative capacity of the United States.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/jones-oscar-nomination.html</url><title>Film

of outstanding scientific achievement</article-subhead><article-text><p>Two UC Santa Cruz graduate students, Caroline Morley and Morgan MacLeod, are winners of the IAU Ph.D. Prize awarded by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).</p>
<p>This is the first year the IAU has awarded the prize, established to recognize outstanding scientific achievement in astronomy by Ph.D. students around the world. Each of the IAU's nine divisions selects a winner in its particular area of astronomy.</p>
<p>Morley won in the Planetary Systems and Bioastronomy division for her dissertation "Exoplanetary atmospheres: Clouds and hazes in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres." Working with professor of astronomy and astrophysics Jonathan Fortney, Morley studied the atmospheres of a variety of objects, from super-Earths to brown dwarfs. She is now a NASA Sagan Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p>
<p>MacLeod won in the Stars and Stellar Physics division for his dissertation "Social stars: Modeling the interactive lives of stars in dense clusters and binary systems in the era of time domain astronomy." He worked with Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, using computational methods to explore close encounters between stars and compact objects. He is now a NASA Einstein Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ.</p>
<p>As IAU Ph.D. Prize winners, Morley and MacLeod will receive airfare, registration fees, and accommodation to attend the next IAU General Assembly, August 20- 31, 2018, in Vienna, Austria. They will also have the opportunity to present their research work in one of the sessions of the General Assembly.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.iau.org/news/announcements/detail/ann17024/</url><title>IAU Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e57017ef807270177c20a6471d6c7faa"><name>policy-sustainable-practices</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Revision to the Sustainable Practices policy</title><summary>The University of California Office of the President has issued a revision to the Sustainable Practices policy. </summary><start-date>1498460400000</start-date><display-name>Policy</display-name><path>/2017/06/policy-sustainable-practices</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/policy-sustainable-practices</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1498497946242</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1498498043908</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California Office of the President has issued a revision to the Sustainable Practices policy.

<p>The challenge was issued to accelerate the development of innovative approaches to single cell analysis that would enable scientists to detect and assess changes in the health status of individual cells over time. Pourmand, an affiliate of the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>, has spent nearly 15 years developing his nanopipette technology, which allows researchers to take miniscule samples from inside a living cell without affecting the cell's activity or viability.</p>
<p>"This is the only technology I know of that enables us to repeatedly interrogate a single cell without killing it," he said. "We are now able to use it to do a multitude of analyses. This is a fundamental platform technology with a wide range of potential applications."</p>
<p>Pourmand was one of 16 finalists in the first phase of the Follow that Cell Challenge. Phase two required generating proof-of-concept data, and Pourmand's nanopipette technology came out on top. He will receive the first place prize and give a talk at the NIH Single Cell Analysis Program's annual investigators meeting at the NIH campus in Bethesda, Md., June 29 to 30.</p>
<p>The nanopipette platform is based on a small glass tube that tapers to a fine tip with a diameter less than 100 nanometers (for comparison, a red blood cell is about 7,000 nanometers across). The nanopipette can extract material from inside a cell without disrupting it, allowing researchers to take repeated samples. The samples can be analyzed in a variety of ways to monitor, for example, changes in gene expression that occur in response to experimental treatments. A cell's metabolic state can be monitored by measuring glucose concentrations and pH (acidity).</p>
<p>Pourmand is particularly interested in using the technology to study cancer cells and understand how they develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs. He is also using it to study neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>
<p>"The nanopipette technology is allowing us to answer questions that can't be addressed with any other technologies," he said.</p>
<p>Launched in August of 2014, the Follow that Cell Challenge seeks to incentivize innovation by awarding prizes based on completed work, in contrast to NIH's traditional, prospective grant and contract mechanisms, which provide funding in advance. The challenge is aimed at finding new ways to learn how cells transition from a healthy to a diseased state, become responsive to treatment, and offer opportunities for early detection and precision medicine. The NIH Common Fund's <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/Singlecell">Single Cell Analysis Program</a> sponsored the challenge, with additional leadership provided by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2017/nih-names-winners-of-follow-that-cell-phase-2-competition.shtml</url><title>NIH Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eae76f8b807270177c20a6479a1ab6da"><name>teaching-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Awards spotlight commitment to teaching</title><summary>Seven UC Santa Cruz faculty members were recognized for their extraordinary commitment teaching. </summary><keywords>teaching awards, faculty, students, education</keywords><start-date>1498546800000</start-date><display-name>Teaching</display-name><path>/2017/06/teaching-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/teaching-awards</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1498589653502</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1500919398128</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/teaching-awards-2017-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/teaching-awards-2017-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teaching-awards-2017-500px.jpg</name><display-name>teaching-awards-2017-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>273964</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Teaching award recipients</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/teaching-awards-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/teaching-awards-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teaching-awards-80.jpg</name><display-name>teaching-awards-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20001</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>Front row: Subhas&#160;Desa, Ruth Murray-Clay, Leta Miller, Andrew Fisher.&#160;Back row: John Tamkun, Baldo Marinovic, Chancellor George Blumenthal, Matthew McCarthy, chair, Committee on Teaching</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Seven UC Santa Cruz faculty members were recognized for their extraordinary commitment to teaching.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal presented this year&#8217;s Excellence in Teaching awards, one of the highest campus honors faculty members can receive, during a June 14 reception at the Arboretum. The seven recipients were selected by the <a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cot-committee-on-teaching/index.html">Academic Senate&#8217;s Committee on Teaching</a> from more than 500 nominations.</p>
<p>Blumenthal said that a focus on excellent teaching is a distinguishing characteristic of UC Santa Cruz. He noted several themes that emerged in the teaching philosophies written by each recipient, including an interest in using technology to improve the classroom experience, selecting authors with a diversity of voices, and a desire to help underrepresented students succeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your willingness to do those things is partly what sets you apart,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;Across the board, you bring caring, passion, talent, and commitment to teaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>The winners of the Excellence in Teaching Award for 2017 are:</p>
<p><strong>Subhas Desa</strong><br/> <em>Senior lecturer in technology management</em></p>
<p>A theme emerges when colleagues talk about Subhas Desa&#8217;s teaching: a deep commitment to the long-term welfare of students. Desa searches for ways to accommodate students so they can graduate on time, even if it means extra work for him or another faculty member.</p>
<p>But he is also known in the Technology Management Department for offering demanding classes. Department Chair Brent Haddad wrote that no matter how hard he makes the classes he teaches, students will say, &#8220;Well, it was hard, but not as hard as a Desa class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students nearly universally heap praise on Subhas&#8217;s teaching, calling it amazing, enthusiastic, committed, and genius.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Fisher</strong><br/> <em>Professor in Earth and planetary sciences</em></p>
<p>Andrew Fisher, a hydrogeologist, has a simple goal as an instructor&#8212;that his students will want to learn more on a subject when the class is done because they gain both understanding and enthusiasm. But succeeding is not simple.</p>
<p>Creating and delivering ideas and information that satisfy this aspiration is an ongoing challenge&#8212;but one at which Fisher succeeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every homework set or lab exercise or presentation should have a narrative arc, with a coherent through-line of ideas, methods and messages, arranged to tell a story" Fisher wrote in his teaching philosophy. &#8220;Course components should be part of a larger and more complex narrative, kind of like a collection of linked short stories that address broad themes, forming a sort of novel.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Baldo Marinovic</strong><br/> <em>Lecturer in ecology, evolutionary biology</em></p>
<p>By the number of students he has taught, the breadth of his teaching, the content of his courses, Baldo Marinovic is perhaps the most important instructor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, department chair Ingrid M. Parker wrote in nominating him.</p>
<p>Since his appointment, Marinovic has taught 12 different courses, to majors and nonmajors, including both lower- and upper-division courses.</p>
<p>Student note that his lectures are entertaining, organized, demanding, rigorous, and rewarding. His teaching style is diverse and allows for different types of learning in the classroom. He mixes use of the whiteboard, PowerPoint presentations, and field lectures.</p>
<p><strong>Leta Miller</strong><br/> <em>Professor of music</em></p>
<p>Leta Miller is one of the most engaging, dynamic, and rigorous teachers in the Arts Division. She cares deeply about her students and is committed to maximizing their learning.</p>
<p>Miller has long set the standard for excellence in the Music Department, according to department chair Dard Neuman. Though she has taught for decades, Miller always adjusts her courses, incorporating new material, new technologies, and new feedback, as well as her new research.</p>
<p>Students note that she is demanding yet caring.</p>
<p><strong>Ruth Murray-Clay<br/> </strong> <em>Professor of astrophysics</em></p>
<p>Ruth Murray-Clay is the recipient of the&#160;Ron Ruby Teaching Award in Physical &amp; Biological Sciences Division. She an outspoken advocate for women in science, working tirelessly to fight against the sexual harassment of female scientists from senior male colleagues.</p>
<p>She has also dedicated herself to the needs of those who have had less educational support and opportunities, making her an outstanding mentor to undergraduate and graduate students, shaping them as both as people and researchers.</p>
<p>As a result, Murray-Clay&#8217;s students are commonly awarded top postdoctoral positions as well as faculty positions in some of the most highly regarded programs in the world. She overhauled a core graduate class to reflect the fast-moving research areas of planetary and galaxy dynamics. Department chair Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz said her evaluations for the class the best he&#8217;s ever seen as chair.</p>
<p><strong>Kiva Silver</strong><br/> <em>Lecturer in the Writing Program (Stevenson College)</em></p>
<p>Kiva Silver aims to help students improve their writing by transforming their thinking about writing. He also inspires them to think more deeply&#8212;more philosophically&#8212;about life itself.</p>
<p>His teaching in many ways then embodies the best of what UCSC promises: a humanistic education that transforms students&#8217; thinking about their work and the world.</p>
<p>Silver&#8217;s students praise him for his ability to help them develop new ways of writing. They come to understand there is no single correct way to compose an essay and that they have agency as writers. Many students say Kiva helped them to write more &#8220;deliberately&#8221; and with a heightened sense of purpose.</p>
<p><strong>John Tamkun</strong><br/> <em>Professor in molecular, cell and developmental biology</em></p>
<p>John Tamkun, a professor in molecular, cell and developmental biology, is an extraordinarily talented and dedicated teacher.</p>
<p>He has long focused with great intensity on improving learning outcomes for undergraduate students in his department and at the campus as a whole.</p>
<p>His recent classroom teaching has been in two courses: undergraduate introductory Molecular and Cell Biology, and graduate Critical Analysis. The introductory class is the department&#8217;s most important and difficult course to teach, said department chair Bill Saxton, so it&#8217;s taught by the most experienced faculty. It serves students who have proposed/declared a biology major, which is one out of every eight UCSC students.</p>
<p>Tamkum approaches the responsibility of introducing students to the core material of our discipline with energy, enthusiasm, and empathy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eb31da21807270177c20a6474f10b6ff"><name>prohibited-state-travel</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on state law prohibiting state-funded travel to certain states</title><summary>On Sept. 27, 2016, Gov.

Brown signed into law AB 1887, which became effective Jan. 1, 2017. This law prohibits state-funded travel to a state that has passed a law after June 26, 2015 that (1) authorizes discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identify, and gender expression, or (2) voids or repeals existing state or local protections against such discrimination. The law expressly identifies the University of California as an entity covered by the law.</p>
<p>Currently, the states of Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas are on the prohibited travel list. The California Attorney General is responsible for developing, maintaining, and posting online the current list of states where travel restrictions apply (<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887" target="_blank">https://oag.ca.gov/ab1887</a>).<br/>
<br/>
 AB 1887 provides a number of exceptions where state-funded travel will be allowed to states that are otherwise on the Attorney General&#8217;s prohibited list. The law also prohibits the University of California from requiring employees to travel to the states on the Attorney General&#8217;s list, regardless of funding source. Consequently, an employee may decline to travel to one of the identified states, unless one of the statutory exceptions applies.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has appointed Katharyne Mitchell as dean of the Division of Social Sciences, effective August 15.</p>
<p>Mitchell comes to the campus from the University of Washington, where she has been on the faculty in the Department of Geography since 1993. She served as chair of the department from 2008-13 and was the Simpson Professor in the Public Humanities for three years beginning in 2004.</p>
<p>An active scholar and the author of numerous books and nearly 90 journal articles and chapters, Mitchell is an urban political geographer who studies transnational migration, refugees and asylum policy, immigrant integration, citizenship, and education. She has received numerous prestigious fellowships, including a 2016 John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship to support fieldwork on faith-based movements and the provision of church sanctuary to migrants in Europe.</p>
<p>In addition, Mitchell has been an adjunct professor of gender, women, and sexuality studies at UW since 1993, and was the director of Canadian Studies from 1998-1999.</p>
<p>"Katharyne Mitchell will bring energy, insight, and experience to the Social Sciences Division," said Marlene Tromp, campus provost and executive vice chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. "I have been impressed by her deep commitment to social justice and the power of higher education to help deliver it. UC Santa Cruz is known for its commitment to equity and environmental sustainability, and Social Sciences is leading the way."</p>
<p>Mitchell said she was drawn to UC Santa Cruz by the campus's "long history of excellent scholarship and engagement that makes a difference in the world."</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz has always been concerned with the big questions of the day from climate change and financial management to the cognitive development of children, all drawn together around issues of equity, power and access," she said.</p>
<p>"This is a critical moment&#8212;a transformational moment that presents opportunities as well as challenges," said Mitchell. "I look forward to being a leader at UC Santa Cruz at this political juncture. It is important for the state and the country&#8212;now more than ever&#8212;that people step forward."</p>
<p>Mitchell's books include the forthcoming "Making Workers: Radical Geographies of Education"; <em>Practising Public Scholarship: Experiences and Possibilities Beyond the Academy</em>; and <em>Crossing the NeoLiberal Line: Pacific Rim Migration and the Metropolis</em>. She is coeditor with R. Jones and J. Fluri of the forthcoming "Handbook on Critical Geographies of Migration," and was coeditor with S. Marston and C. Katz of <em>Life's Work: Geographies of Social Reproduction</em>.</p>
<p>Mitchell will join the faculty as a professor of sociology. She succeeds Sheldon Kamieniecki, who retired in June after 11 years as dean.</p>
<p>Mitchell earned her B.A. in art and archaeology from Princeton University and her Ph.D. in geography from UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Mitchell is married to Matthew Sparke, a professor of geography at UW who will be joining UC Santa Cruz as a professor of politics; they have two adult children.</p>
<p>The Division of Social Sciences is the largest academic division at UC Santa Cruz, with eight academic departments (Anthropology, Economics, Education Environmental Studies, Latin American and Latino Studies, Politics, Psychology, and Sociology), two residential undergraduate colleges, eight Ph.D. programs, and 25 undergraduate degree programs. The division confers more than 45 percent of the bachelors degrees and 30 percent of the doctorates awarded annually.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f0615f20807270177c20a64716072d74"><name>social-sciences-dean</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New Social Sciences dean</title><summary>I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Katharyne Mitchell as dean of the Social Sciences Division.

She starts on Aug. 15.</p>
<p>Katharyne joins UC Santa Cruz from the University of Washington, where she was a professor of geography. She has spent the past year on a Guggenheim Fellowship, which she used to explore the nature of sanctuary and the role of faith-based movements in migration policy and human-rights discourse in Europe.</p>
<p>Her research is wide-reaching, covering transnational migration, refugees and asylum policy, immigrant integration, citizenship, and education. She earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in art and archaeology from Princeton, and a master&#8217;s and a Ph.D. in geography from UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>As dean, she will be a vocal advocate for the Social Sciences and for the strengths of this campus: both undergraduate and graduate education, research, and interdisciplinary scholarship.</p>
<p>To learn more about Katharyne, please read our campus news office's <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/06/mitchell-dean.html" target="_blank">announcement of her appointment</a>.</p>
<p>Don Brenneis, professor of anthropology and former chair of the Academic Senate, will serve as interim Social Sciences dean from July 1 until Katharyne&#8217;s arrival. I appreciate Don taking on this leadership role.</p>
<p>Katharyne succeeds Sheldon Kamieniecki, who guided the division for 11 years. He led with distinction, bringing in extraordinary faculty and raising the campus profile with a new Ph.D. program in Latin American and Latino Studies, and a new master&#8217;s degree in Coastal Science and Policy, among many other accomplishments. We thank him for his service to campus and wish him well in his retirement.</p>
<p>I also want to thank members of the search committee for their service, including committee chair Tyler Stovall, Humanities dean, who oversaw the national search to fill this key academic leadership post.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f49e9eba807270177c20a647e58f99fa"><name>data-science-center</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz launches new data science research center</title><summary>Data, Discovery, and Decisions (D3) research center provides a platform for collaboration between industry and academia in the emerging field of data science.</summary><keywords>Lise Getoor, D3, data science</keywords><start-date>1498752000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz launches new data science research center</display-name><path>/2017/06/data-science-center</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/data-science-center</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1498752653585</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1498755362293</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/d3-logo-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/d3-logo-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>d3-logo-400.jpg</name><display-name>d3-logo-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>47252</file-size><width>400</width><height>108</height></image><image-alt>D3 logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/d3-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/d3-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>d3-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>d3-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21739</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>D3 logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/lise-getoor-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/lise-getoor-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lise-getoor-375.jpg</name><display-name>lise-getoor-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>98656</file-size><width>375</width><height>449</height></image><image-alt>Lise Getoor</image-alt><image-caption>Lise Getoor, D3 Center Director&#160; (photo by C. Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Data, Discovery, and Decisions (D3) research center provides a platform for collaboration between industry and academia in the emerging field of data science</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has launched a new data science research center, <a href="http://d3.ucsc.edu/">Data, Discovery, and Decisions (D3)</a>. Led by Lise Getoor, professor of computer science in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, D3 provides a platform for collaboration between industry and academia in the emerging field of data science.</p>
<p>The ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data has driven the emergence of data science as a new discipline. The <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> has identified data science as a key focus area for the school.</p>
<p>"The establishment of the D3 Research Center within the Baskin School of Engineering will support our growing activities in data-driven discovery and decision making," said engineering dean Alexander Wolf. "It will provide an infrastructure for researchers in industry and academia to exchange ideas and develop practical solutions to data science challenges."</p>
<p>A central aim of D3 is to develop open-source tools to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the growing scale and heterogeneity of modern data sets.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of commonality in the problems and methods of dealing with heterogeneous, richly structured data, whether that data is from the Internet of Things, or information integration, or the modeling of socio-behavioral interactions," said Getoor, who chairs the Computing Research Association's Committee on Data Science.</p>
<p>The structure of D3 is modeled after the National Science Foundation's Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers, such as the <a href="https://www.crss.ucsc.edu/">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> at UC Santa Cruz. Industry partners will provide input on current industry research needs through participation in research panels, data sharing, and other types of collaboration. "We will work together to identify emerging challenges in data science and develop the tools needed to address them," Getoor said.</p>
<p>The founding members of D3 include <a href="https://www.diffbot.com/">Diffbot</a>, which offers automatic web-crawling and bulk data processing capabilities to allow applications to leverage previously unstructured web data; <a href="https://www.drawbridge.com/">Drawbridge</a>, an identity management company that enables brands and enterprises to create personalized consumer experiences; and <a href="http://www.omnyiq.com/">OmnyIQ</a>, which provides services for device manufacturers to monitor, troubleshoot, and automatically repair connected devices. Supporting contributions have also come from Bosch, Glassbeam, and VMWare.</p>
<p>"We know academic researchers are spending significant time tackling similar problems that we have been studying, and it's important to have a forum to exchange and cross-examine ideas and approaches," said Drawbridge CTO Devin Guan, who chairs the D3 industry advisory board. "Bridging academia and industry will encourage and expedite innovation in this field, which is beneficial for everyone."</p>
<p>Each of the member companies brings a wealth of expertise in the area of data science, Getoor noted. "Bringing together their perspectives in a collaborative environment gives us the ability to see the commonalities and build widely applicable tools, rather than solving individual problems," Getoor said.</p>
<p>Abel Rodriguez, professor of applied mathematics and statistics, will serve as associate director of D3. Other UCSC faculty members affiliated with the center include computer scientists Peter Alvaro, Seshadhri Comandur, Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, SVN Vishwanathan, and Marilyn Walker, and technology management professor Yi Zhang.</p>
<p>As an example of the type of open-source tools she envisions being developed at D3, Getoor cited <a href="http://psl.linqs.org/">Probabilistic Soft Logic</a>, a machine learning framework her research group has developed for building probabilistic models over richly structured graph and network data.</p>
<p>Getoor will be speaking on "Data science: A collaboration of statistics and computer science" at the <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/">Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM2017)</a> in Baltimore on July 31, joining Robert Tibshirani of Stanford University in a special session sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f6471c02807270177c20a647895e7ced"><name>moschkovich-nas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Judit Moschkovich appointed to NAS committee</title><summary>Judit Moschkovich, professor of education, will serve on a National Academy of Sciences committee focused on the needs of English Learners in STEM subjects. </summary><keywords>moschkovich, education, STEM, mathematics, science, learning, English</keywords><start-date>1498719600000</start-date><display-name>Moschkovich-NAS</display-name><path>/2017/06/moschkovich-nas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/moschkovich-nas</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1498780472919</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1498852009867</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/moschkovich.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/moschkovich.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moschkovich.jpg</name><file-size>11473</file-size><width>228</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Judit Moschkovich</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Judit Moschkovich, professor of education and graduate director of the Education Department, was invited by the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education of the National Academy of Sciences to serve as a member of the committee "Supporting English Learners in STEM Subjects."</p>
<p>The committee will spend two years examining three aspects of research on how to support English learners in pre-K through 12th grade: learning, teaching, and assessment in STEM subjects, including the role of language in learning STEM; successful programs or interventions both within the United States and abroad; and the needs of both pre-service and in-service STEM teachers with respect to English learners.</p>
<p>The work will result in a National Research Council consensus volume to be published in 2019.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="af627be080727017465caccef1b6793d"><name>interim-it-vc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Brad Smith to serve as interim vice chancellor for IT</title><summary>It is a pleasure to announce that Brad Smith, director of information technology services, research and faculty partnerships, and adjunct associate professor of computer engineering, has agreed to serve as vice chancellor for information technology on an interim basis. </summary><start-date>1498806000000</start-date><display-name>Brad Smith to serve as interim vice chancellor for IT</display-name><path>/2017/06/interim-it-vc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/06/interim-it-vc</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1579195464638</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1579195464638</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>It is a pleasure to announce that Brad Smith, director of information technology services, research and faculty partnerships, and adjunct associate professor of computer engineering, has agreed to serve as vice chancellor for information technology on an interim basis. Pending approval from UC President Janet Napolitano, this appointment will begin today (June 30) and extend until we fill the position on a permanent basis.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Brad is a well-known face at UC Santa Cruz. He earned his bachelor&#8217;s, master&#8217;s and Ph.D., all in computer science, at the university. He also has worked in numerous capacities on campus over the past 25 years. Prior to being named director of faculty partnerships in 2006, his duties included computing director at the Baskin School of Engineering and director of core technologies for Information Technology Services. In addition, he has taught computer engineering classes on campus for the past decade.&#160;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>I look forward to working with Brad during this leadership transition. His deep familiarity with campus and the division, coupled with his expertise in information technology, ensure we won't miss a step.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Brad is temporarily filling the seat of Mary Doyle, who is retiring after nearly a decade on campus as vice chancellor for information technology.&#160;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Mary has been a deeply valued member of the leadership of UC Santa Cruz, and I am grateful to her for her many accomplishments, among them Connected Central Coast. Mary was a driving force behind the project that extended a fiber-optic internet backbone from Santa Cruz into the Salinas Valley, boosting network service to underserved communities while also providing a reliable backup to the single fiber-optic line that connects campus to Silicon Valley.&#160;</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>In addition, Mary secured campus approval for our Telecommunications Infrastructure Upgrade, which will bring modern communications capabilities to all buildings on campus, and she has championed the project through its many phases. She also started the transition of the campus's major computing applications to the cloud, providing the potential for more robust, scalable, and cost-effective service.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>The campus is wrapping up a nationwide search for Mary&#8217;s successor, and we hope to make an announcement soon.</div>
