<p>Giving Day 2017 builds on the success of last year&#8217;s event, when nearly 3,000 donors came together to collectively give $340,000.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu">givingday.ucsc.edu</a> site will go live at 12:01 a.m. on March 8 for donors to make gifts and track their favorite projects in real-time. Before then, visitors to the site can preview projects and find ones that mean the most to them. Projects are grouped in categories that reflect the diversity of choices, such as Environment &amp; Sustainability, Diversity Outreach, Scholarships, Social Justice &amp; Activism, Community Ties, Arts &amp; Letters, and Athletic Teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving Day highlights the breadth of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;This day gives our students the chance to engage directly with our supporters. I invite our friends and alumni to be a part of this important event for our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incentives to give on March 8 include matching funds for specific projects, and challenges throughout the day to reward project teams that attract the greatest number of donors. All gifts will count toward the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which is entering its home stretch.</p>
<p>Leading up to Giving Day, teams have begun reaching out to supporters, sharing videos and details of what donor gifts to their projects will accomplish. Many projects are student-led; all benefit students.</p>
<p>Teams that advanced their work after connecting strongly with donors last year include the Bird School Project, Formula Slug, the Arboretum, and Gail Project. Each is among the many returning entries &#8211; and scores of new ones this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We learned last year how important it was to our campus to have this focused, fun event that showcases grassroots, online philanthropy,&#8221; said Keith Brant, vice chancellor for University Relations. &#8220;The rich array of projects we are able to highlight this year underscores that even more powerfully. These projects are a great way to support the campus and to be a part of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/371768786531635/">event page on Facebook</a>, and the hashtag #give2UCSC are among social media tools being used to help spread the word about Giving Day projects. Campus events on day-of are planned for Quarry Plaza and at OPERS.</p>

students compete to explain their academic pursuits in 240 seconds or less</article-subhead><article-text><p>Twelve UC Santa Cruz graduate students provided brief glimpses into their ongoing research in the third annual campuswide Grad Slam, a three-minute elevator pitch competition to encourage better storytelling about complex academic topics.</p>
<p>John Felts, a second year Ph.D. electrical engineering student, earned top marks for his talk about creating environmentally friendly surfboard foam from the shells of shrimp. He won $3,000 and the opportunity to compete in a <a href="https://gradslam.universityofcalifornia.edu">UC-wide competition</a> on May 4.</p>
<p>Sam Mansfield, whose research into how technology can help avoid the epidemic of bed sores among the elderly and most vulnerable, earned second place honors and $1,500. He also won the coveted People&#8217;s Choice Award, which came with a $750 prize.</p>
<p>A community panel comprised of leaders in government and the nonprofit sector judged the Friday event held on campus. About 190 attendees were invited to vote on their favorite presentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an opportunity for students to think about communicating their work to a general audience and to consider the potential impact of scholarships and researchers on their everyday lives,&#8221; said Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of Division of Graduate Studies, who emceed the event. &#8220;An event like this takes their specialized work out of the ivory tower and makes it meaningful to the general public.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a night of stiff competition for the finalists who had the unenviable task of reducing their academic passions&#8212;from primordial black holes and cleft lip speech therapy to feminist cinema theory and the far-reaching benefits of soil microbes&#8212;into a mere 240-second presentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not judging the merit of the research, but on students&#8217; ability to tell a story,&#8221; said Sonya Newlyn, a program assistant who helped organize the event.</p>
<p>The program encourages students to better communicate the potential impact of their research, a critical skill for any academic working on issues of the day that may call for funding or legislative actions. Similar competitions, based on the Three Minute Thesis competition developed by the University of Queensland, are held on university campuses all over the world.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s UC Santa Cruz participants were selected from a group of 32 graduate students who submitted video presentations about a thesis or dissertation earlier in the school year. Finalists presented research from diverse areas including: digital arts and new media; physics; computer science; microbiology and environmental toxicology; environmental studies; molecular, cell, and developmental biology; film and digital media; computer engineering; computer science; earth sciences; and electrical engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re understanding that we can&#8217;t just do our specialized work and assume it&#8217;s going to have the impact it could have if we were reaching out and bringing people into our thinking,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;Bridging that gap is more important now than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his winning presentation, Felts talked about how he has been studying the potential of chitin&#8212;or shrimp shell material&#8212;to replace polyurethane and polystyrene foams with Marco Rolandi, associate professor of Electrical Engineering. The foam currently used in most surfboards has a lifespan of hundreds of years and is detrimental to the environment. Rolandi and Felts have two related provisional patents and are exploring other ideas for the use of chitin and other naturally occurring biomaterials.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to relate the benefits of our research so people can really understand what we&#8217;re doing and the importance of it,&#8221; Felts said. &#8220;The Grad Slam is really useful for developing those tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mansfield is a third year doctoral student working on the <a href="https://inrg.soe.ucsc.edu/?project=bsdp-bed-sore-detection-and-prevention">Bed Sore Detection and Prevention</a> project with Katia Obraczka, a computer engineering professor, and UC San Francisco. The goal of the project is to create a sensor network that monitors a patient to determine when a bedsore will form and avoid such formations.</p>
<p>This panel of judges included Cynthia Chase, Santa Cruz mayor; Zach Friend, Santa Cruz County supervisor; Cynthia Mathews, Santa Cruz councilwoman; Carolyn O&#8217;Donnell Shimek, California Strawberry Commission communications director; Lynda Rogers, UCSC University Extension dean; Nina Simon, Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History executive director.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/events/grad-slam/2017-gradslam/index.html</url><title>Top 12 UC Santa Cruz finalists</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://gradslam.universityofcalifornia.edu</url><title>UCOP Grad Slam on May 4</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuuzLoaK3RKUlGfqZ6rKV0A8Dx5N25kcN</url><title>2016 Grad Slam presentations</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8cc099f58072701752a34ca3315cb4ae"><name>kapany-library-sikh-gift</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gift from Narinder Kapany will establish Sikh book collection and study room at McHenry Library</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has received a gift from Dr. Narinder Kapany to establish the Sundar Singh Kapany Book Collection and the Sundar Singh Kapany Group Study Room in the University Library.&#13;

<br/>
 The gift, including Kapany&#8217;s personal collection of Sikh books, is valued at $55,000.<br/>
<br/>
 "It provides a large set of books on Sikhs and Sikhism that will be a significant new local resource for students, faculty, and community members who are interested in various aspects of UCSC's Sikh and Punjabi Studies program," noted Nirvikar Singh, distinguished professor of economics and the Sarbjit Singh Aurora Chair in Sikh and Punjabi Studies at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 Kapany, the founding chairman of the Sikh Foundation and a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, was also a Regents Professor at UC Santa Cruz from 1977 to 1983. In 1999, he endowed the Narinder Singh Kapany Chair in Optoelectronics at the Baskin School of Engineering.<br/>
<br/>
 In 2008, Kapany was honored with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation&#8217;s Fiat Lux Award in recognition of his outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the university&#8217;s program and goals.<br/>
<br/>
 A pioneering fiber-optics researcher and entrepreneur, he also made a gift of $500,000 to UC Santa Cruz in 2012 to establish an endowed chair in entrepreneurship.<br/>
<br/>
 The Sikh and Punjabi Studies program at UC Santa Cruz began in 2011, following a gift from Hardit and Harbhajan K. Singh, through the Sikh Foundation, to fund an endowed chair. The goal of the program is to advance teaching and research that increases understanding of Sikh and Punjabi culture with a global perspective.<br/>
<br/>
 Based in the Humanities Division, the Sikh and Punjabi Studies program brings together faculty across the humanities and beyond, including the fields of history, literature, art, music, and economics.&#160;</p>
<p>There are approximately 25 million Sikhs in the world today, with significant communities living in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, Fiji, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The ancestral home of the Sikhs is the Punjab region, divided between Pakistan and northern India. Sikhs arrived in California more than a century ago, and their descendants today are employed in activities ranging from high-tech entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley to farming in the Central Valley.</p>

<p>The Giving Back Award honors college and university administrators who go above and beyond their everyday leadership duties and give back to their campuses and communities. Koch will be featured, along with 38 other recipients, in the April 2017 Leadership Support and Giving Back issue of <em>Insight Into Diversity</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Award recipients were nominated by their colleagues and selected by <em>Insight Into Diversity</em> based on their outstanding demonstration of social responsibility; involvement with students, faculty, staff, and the community; and commitment to serving underrepresented populations. Each honoree is recognized for his or her passion, dedication, and support for diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>"We have great science programs at UC Santa Cruz. Raising funds and building programs to ensure that the students and faculty in the sciences reflect the diversity of California has been a priority for me as dean, and one of the best parts of the job," Koch said.</p>
<p>As dean of physical and biological sciences, Koch has been a strong supporter of diversity programs and a vocal advocate for diversity across the campus. He has committed and raised funding for a variety of diversity programs that support underrepresented minority students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including programs outside of his division. He also contributes to the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">Office of STEM Diversity Programs</a>, an umbrella office that includes three NIH-funded, one NSF-funded, and two state-funded diversity programs.</p>
<p>"Dean Koch is not only supporting diversity through financial support, he is creating a culture of diversity at UC Santa Cruz that will become part of our institutional ethos long after he steps down," wrote Zia Isola, director of the UCSC Genomics Institute Office of Diversity, in a nomination letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Giving Back Award is being awarded to leaders of institutions of higher education who exemplify what it truly means to &#8216;give back&#8217; to others,&#8221; said Holly Mendelson, publisher of <em>Insight Into Diversity</em> magazine. &#8220;These administrators are role models, and we honor their efforts to promote diversity and inclusion on their campuses and in their communities.&#8221;</p>

K. Gunderson Family Chair in Theoretical Astrophysics</article-subhead><article-text><p>Ruth Murray-Clay, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, was honored as the inaugural holder of the E. K. Gunderson Family Chair in Theoretical Astrophysics at an investiture ceremony on Wednesday, March 1, at the University Center.</p>
<p>The chair was established in 2016 with a $160,000 gift from James L. Gunderson and Valerie J. Boom to support recruitment of a faculty member in astronomy and astrophysics. The chair honors the work of Gunderson's father, a psychologist whose work on human adaptation to confined and extreme conditions was used by NASA in understanding the implications of space travel.</p>
<p>Murray-Clay studies the formation and evolution of the solar system and of planetary systems around other stars. She explores a broad range of physical processes that contribute to the ultimate structure of planetary systems, including the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, planet formation, gravitational dynamics, and the evolution of atmospheres. She also studies objects in the outer reaches of our solar system for clues to its dynamical evolution.</p>
<p>"I am excited and honored to be here and to be the recipient of this chair," said Murray-Clay, who joined the UCSC astronomy faculty in 2016. She received her bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy at Harvard University and her master's and Ph.D. degrees in astrophysics at UC Berkeley. In 2015, Murray-Clay won the Helen B. Warner Prize for Astronomy, which recognizes the exceptional contributions of astronomers under the age of 36.</p>
<p>Increasing support for faculty chairs is a priority of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>, which has raised $311 million for the campus.&#160;The Gunderson Family Chair in Theoretical Astrophysics is a four-year term chair (not an endowed chair) specially designed to augment the startup funding the campus provides for new faculty. Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, said such chairs provide important support for a new faculty member's research and graduate students. "The support from these chairs allows us to be competitive and attract the best faculty," he said.</p>

Beyond Compliance is an ongoing effort to help shift the campus culture around sexual violence and sexual harassment from one focused on meeting legal requirements to one that, ideally, eliminates sexual harassment and violence altogether.</p>
<p>In light of the important conversations about sexual violence now taking place on campus, we have decided to hold two separate Beyond Compliance events, one this quarter to provide an opportunity for campus healing and community building and one in early Spring quarter to offer updates about campus and university policy and Beyond Compliance initiatives, and give people an opportunity to ask general questions about Title IX processes. Our Winter quarter event is a Restorative Justice Community Building Circle, which will take place on Wednesday, March 15th, from 7:00 - 9:00 pm at the Namaste Lounge (C9/10).</p>
<p>Students, staff and faculty are invited to participate in our Community Building Circle to open the potential for dialogue and healing regarding the impact of incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment on campus. The gathering aims to provide an opportunity for everyone to have a voice in sharing their experience, open lines of communication, engender feelings of support, re-build trust, strengthen the campus community, provide a forum for collaborative decision-making, and begin the journey of individual and collective healing.</p>
<p>Due to the modest size of the room, we can accommodate a limited number of people, so it is recommended that you arrive early to secure a space. Also, due to the nature of the circle, we encourage you to arrive before or by 7:00 pm, after which time we will close the doors to preserve the space. This circle will be facilitated by Gabriela Arredondo (Professor and Chair of Latin American and Latino Studies), Bettina Aptheker (Distinguished Professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies and UC Presidential Co-Chair), and Vicki Duval (UCSC Restorative Justice Program Coordinator).</p>
<p>The event is co-sponsored by the Beyond Compliance Group, the ten colleges, GSA, SUA, Academic Senate, and Academic Affairs Office.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Kimberly Lau, Professor, Literature; Vice Chair, Academic Senate; and Martin Berger, Professor, History of Art &amp; Visual Culture; Acting Vice Provost for Academic Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://senate.ucsc.edu/archives/Current%20Issues/Sexual%20Violence%20and%20Sexual%20Harassment%20Prevention/SEC%20SVSH%20Statement.pdf</url><title>Senate Executive Committee Statement on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a56b53f98072701750317288bd361e15"><name>stamp-media-book-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Film professor Shelley Stamp wins 2017 international media and history book prize</title><summary>Film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp has been named the recipient of the 2017 Michael Nelson Book Prize, presented by the International Association for Media and History for her latest book, "Lois Weber in Early Hollywood."</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, ucsc film, shelley stamp, lois weber in early Hollywood</keywords><start-date>1488834900000</start-date><display-name>stamp-media=book-award</display-name><path>/2017/03/stamp-media-book-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/stamp-media-book-award</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1488833957452</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1488835325084</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/stamp-book-cover-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/stamp-book-cover-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stamp-book-cover-250.jpg</name><display-name>stamp-book-cover-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>96467</file-size><width>250</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/stamp-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/stamp-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stamp-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>stamp-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19692</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/Shelley-Stamp-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/Shelley-Stamp-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Shelley-Stamp-250.jpg</name><display-name>Shelley-Stamp-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>104730</file-size><width>250</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Shelley Stamp</image-alt><image-caption>Shelley Stamp</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp has been named the recipient of the <strong><em>2017 Michael Nelson Book Prize</em></strong>, presented by the International Association for Media and History. 
<p>Stamp will travel to Paris in July to accept the award for her latest book, <em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood,</em> at the organization&#8217;s 40th anniversary conference titled &#8220;Media and History: Crime, Violence and Justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nelson prize is awarded biennially to the book &#8220;making the best contribution on the subject of media and history&#8221; that has been published in the preceding two years.</p>
<p>Stamp&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520284463"><strong><em>Lois Weber in Early Hollywood</em></strong></a> (published by University of California Press), was previously named one of the best film books of 2015 by the <em>Huffington Post</em>.</p>
<p>It was also awarded the&#160;2015&#160;Richard Wall Award Special Jury Prize for &#8220;an exemplary work in the field of recorded performance&#8221; from the <a href="http://www.tla-online.org/"><strong><em>Theatre Library Association</em></strong></a>, which annually presents awards for the best English language works of scholarship on theatre, film, and broadcasting.</p>
<p>One of&#160;the most prolific directors of the silent film era, Lois Weber was a writer, producer, actress, and head of her own production company, who paved the way for filmmakers who envisioned film as an opportunity to inject their own ideas and philosophies into a rapidly growing entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Her work took on controversial subjects of the time&#8212;including poverty, addiction, capital punishment, and the fight to legalize birth control.</p>
<p>A leading expert on women and early film culture, Stamp is interested in tracing the contributions women made to early Hollywood as filmmakers, moviegoers, performers, critics and theorists.</p>
<p>She is also the author of <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6851.html">Movie-Struck Girls: Women and Motion Picture Culture after the Nickelodeon</a>; co-editor of <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;view=toc;idno=heb08010.0001.001">American Cinema&#8217;s Transitional Era: Audiences, Institutions, Practices</a>; and founding editor of <a href="http://fmh.ucpress.edu/">Feminist Media Histories: An International Journal.</a></p>

<p>The session, part of the campus&#8217;s Beyond Compliance initiative, will be from 7&#8211;9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 15 at the Namaste Lounge in Colleges 9/10.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope this event will initiate a process that will move us toward community healing,&#8221; said Vice Chair of the Academic Senate Kim Lau and Acting Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Martin Berger, who co-chair the Beyond Compliance group.</p>
<p>The event is co-sponsored by the Beyond Compliance group, the ten colleges, Graduate Student Association, Student Union Assembly, Academic Senate, and Academic Affairs Office.</p>
<p>The circle will be facilitated by Gabriela Arredondo, professor and chair of Latin American and Latino Studies, Bettina Aptheker, distinguished professor of Feminist Studies and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, and Vicki Duval, the campus Restorative Justice Program coordinator.</p>
<p>The goals of a restorative justice healing circle include giving everyone a chance to share their experience; supporting open lines of communication; engendering feelings of support; rebuilding trust; strengthening the campus community; providing a forum for collaborative decision-making; and working to support individuals and the community in healing.</p>
<p>The Beyond Compliance initiative was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service.html">launched last year</a> by then-Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway as a first step in encouraging UC Santa Cruz to &#8220;define concrete mechanisms that administrators and faculty can adopt, above and beyond what is required by law or policy, to advance a culture of service to each other and our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/beyond-compliance-town-hall.html">first forum</a> in May 2016 led to a working group comprised of leadership from the Academic Senate and from across campus, including graduate and undergraduate students. Since then, the group has worked with the administration to refine campus policy and suggest new ways of grappling with the issue of sexual violence and sexual harassment on campus. It also hopes to build on the actionable outcomes generated at the restorative justice healing circle as well as ideas generated through future visioning exercises with students, faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>Berger said the Beyond Compliance group has another event planned for 6&#8211;8 p.m. on April 13 at the Oakes College Learning Center to offer updates about campus and university policy and Beyond Compliance initiatives, give people an opportunity to ask general questions about Title IX processes, and provide feedback and ideas about how we as a community might begin to shift the culture around sexual violence and sexual harassment and campus and in society at large.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2017/03/svsh-community-building</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2017/03/svsh-community-building</link><site>news</site><name>svsh-community-building</name><display-name>Community</display-name><title>Sexual violence/sexual harassment community building circle</title><summary>Students, staff and faculty are invited to participate in our Community Building Circle to open the potential for dialogue and healing regarding the impact of incidents of sexual violence and sexual harassment on campus. </summary><keywords>sexual violence, community, restorative justice, </keywords><start-date>Mar 3, 2017 8:00 AM</start-date></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url/><title>Sexual violence/sexual harassment community building circle</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://senate.ucsc.edu/archives/Current%20Issues/Sexual%20Violence%20and%20Sexual%20Harassment%20Prevention/SEC%20SVSH%20Statement.pdf</url><title>Senate Executive Committee Statement on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aa29059f8072701750317288d460a25d"><name>career-tracks-huddle</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Need a Career Tracks Huddle?</title><summary>As we continue to work  together to complete the launch of Career Tracks at UC Santa Cruz, we are pleased to offer additional "My Classification" Individual Employee Forums this week.</summary><start-date>1488787200000</start-date><display-name>Need a Career Tracks Huddle?</display-name><path>/2017/03/career-tracks-huddle</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/career-tracks-huddle</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1488913497978</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1488913787382</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Need a Career Tracks Huddle?<br/>

 Career Tracks Quick Overview<br/>
 <br/>
 The goal of Career Tracks is to group jobs into more clearly defined families and functions that better align with comparable jobs in other UC locations and in the external labor market. The vision is to implement Career Tracks at all UC campuses and medical centers over the next few years.<br/>
 <br/>
 Senior Management Group, academics, represented staff, and students are not affected. Career Tracks will not affect job duties or function, working ("business card") title or current base pay. Career Tracks has replaced UC's outdated job classification framework with a market-based system for all non represented employees.<br/>
 <br/>
 Information will be posted as dates are added at the News &amp; Events page on the Staff HR Career Tracks website.<br/>

A new study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz shows that the amount of sediment a river transports is a key factor in determining river channel geometry and the size of the sediment grains on the riverbed.</p>
<p>The findings, published March 13 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, undermine a common assumption about gravel-bedded rivers. The idea, supported by decades of observations, is that gravel-bedded rivers reach an equilibrium, called a threshold channel, where the median-sized grains on the riverbed only start to move when the channel is full (the "bankfull flow" stage, just short of flooding).</p>
<p>"If all channels are threshold channels, that's convenient because it helps us make predictions for management decisions and for modeling landscape evolution," said first author Allison Pfeiffer, a doctoral candidate in Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>But Pfeiffer found that the assumption does not hold for rivers in regions with high erosion rates leading to large amounts of sediment moving through the river channels. These conditions are common in the steep, tectonically active landscapes found along the West Coast of North America. When Pfeiffer analyzed data on channel geometries and erosion rates for gravel-bedded rivers throughout North America, she found most of the rivers that violate the threshold assumption are on the West Coast.</p>
<p><strong>Steep landscapes</strong></p>
<p>"Rivers in steep landscapes like the Santa Cruz Mountains transport lots of sediment compared to rivers in, say, Michigan or upstate New York," Pfeiffer said. "These rivers with high sediment supplies have adjusted their geometry to transport sediments at more moderate flows, so it doesn't take a flood event to move a lot of sediment."</p>
<p>As a result, the sediment on the riverbed is much finer than would be predicted by the threshold channel model. Coauthor Noah Finnegan, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, explained that threshold channels may only develop in settings where a low sediment supply allows the smaller grains to be swept away and not replaced. Left behind is a layer of "armoring" on the riverbed consisting of larger grains that might only move at the highest flow rates.</p>
<p>"West Coast rivers tend to have a less well-developed armor layer," Finnegan said. "If you change the sediment supply, the quickest thing to adjust will be the grain size in the armor layer."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Salmon habitat</strong></p>
<p>When he and his students take measurements in local rivers, he said, the results typically do not conform to the threshold channel paradigm. Pfeiffer encountered this in the course of a project to predict the distribution of salmon spawning habitat in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Salmon need gravel in a certain size range to build their nests. Using the threshold assumption, Pfeiffer's predictions of gravel size were off by a factor of three.</p>
<p>"That can be a huge difference for a Coho salmon," she said. "Now we know that the sediment supply is a key factor that has to be taken into consideration if we're trying to predict salmon habitat."</p>
<p>The findings may also have practical implications for the design of river restoration projects. Rivers are self-forming systems, and their channels form and reform with every flood event. Efforts to impose human designs on them are not always successful.</p>
<p>"Rivers are tricky puzzles that continue to bring us new challenges," Pfeiffer said. "The importance of the sediment supply has perhaps gone underappreciated. We don't yet have the kind of theoretical model of river channels that we'd like to have, but this study shows that the sediment supply is a variable that has to be included in the model."</p>
<p>Coauthor Jane Willenbring, a geologist at UC San Diego, contributed the data on erosion rates. Pfeiffer's research was supported by a grant from the ARCS Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aafbae1c807270175031728850f69e2b"><name>flowering-time</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Flowering times shift with loss of species from a grassland ecosystem</title><summary>Loss of biodiversity may exacerbate changes in the timing of biological events already being driven by climate change, study finds.</summary><keywords>Erika Zavaleta, climate change, serpentine grassland, grassland ecosystem</keywords><start-date>1489431720000</start-date><display-name>Flowering times shift with loss of species from a grassland ecosystem</display-name><path>/2017/03/flowering-time</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/flowering-time</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1488927303828</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1489431433809</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/spring-flowers-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/spring-flowers-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spring-flowers-450.jpg</name><display-name>spring-flowers-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>171377</file-size><width>450</width><height>336</height></image><image-alt>spring flowers</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/goldfields-butterfly-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/goldfields-butterfly-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>goldfields-butterfly-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>goldfields-butterfly-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26964</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>flower with butterfly</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Wildflowers (<em>Sisyrinchium, Eschscholzia, Lasthenia, Muilla,</em> and others) bloom on the experimental site at Coyote Ridge, California.

(Photo by Jae Pasari)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Loss of biodiversity may exacerbate changes in the timing of biological events already being driven by climate change, study finds</article-subhead><article-text><p>Scientists have documented many cases in which the timing of seasonal events, such as the flowering of plants or the emergence of insects, is changing as a result of climate change. Now researchers studying a grassland ecosystem in California have discovered that reducing the number of species in the system can also cause a significant shift in when the remaining species flower.</p>
<p>These kinds of changes are a concern because they can lead to mismatches in timing between species that depend on one another, such as plants that flower when their insect pollinators aren't around, or birds that hatch when their food isn't abundant. The new findings suggest that future changes in biological timing could be much bigger than would be expected from climate change alone.</p>
<p>"We found that losing species from an ecosystem made the remaining species flower earlier, and that's the same effect that climate change has. Adding one on top of the other could push apart the timing of previously synchronized events even more than expected," said Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Zavaleta and her colleagues conducted the study in a serpentine grassland, a rare ecosystem in California that occurs only on serpentine soils and includes many species that grow nowhere else. After reducing the number of species in experimental plots, they found that most of the remaining species flowered earlier than usual. The findings are published March 13 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>
<p>The observed changes in flowering time may be mediated by changes in the physical environment, such as soil temperature, soil moisture, or nitrogen availability, that result from reduced plant diversity. "It could be due to resources that are freed up by the loss of other species, but we have not yet been able to test that experimentally," Zavaleta said.</p>
<p>The research team included first author Amelia Wolf, who led the study as a postdoctoral researcher in Zavaleta's lab and is now affiliated with Columbia University and based at UC Davis.</p>
<p>"Advanced spring flowering is one of the most well-described and well-publicized phenomena linking global warming to plant communities," Wolf said. "The changes in flowering time we observed in these experiments are similar in magnitude to the effects induced by climate change."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Global warming</strong></p>
<p>The flowering shift attributable to the loss of two species in the study was about the same as the average change due to one decade of global warming in long-term observational datasets, she said. Warming experiments with plants in controlled settings have tended to underestimate the timing shifts observed in nature, and the new findings suggest that some of this difference could be the result of changes in biodiversity.</p>
<p>Zavaleta noted that humans are having major impacts on the composition and diversity of plant communities worldwide. Threats to plant biodiversity include habitat loss, invasive species, atmospheric pollution, and direct harvesting.</p>
<p>Previous work in Zavaleta's lab has documented how species losses can trigger cascading effects in an ecosystem, as when the loss of a plant species triggers the loss of an insect that pollinates it, or when the loss of an animal species triggers the loss of plants that depend on it for seed dispersal.</p>
<p>"We are losing species at such a fast rate these days, it raises the question of how these effects cascade through an ecosystem and affect the ecology and evolution of what's left," she said. "This study reveals a new pathway by which species loss can affect the dynamics of an ecosystem. It opens up the possibility that biological timing is going to respond in unexpected ways to the onslaught of different stresses that natural systems are experiencing, and the responses could be bigger than expected."</p>
<p>In addition to Zavaleta and Wolf, the research team included coauthor Paul Selmants at the U.S. Geological Survey's Western Geographic Science Center in Menlo Park, Calif.

These are among the conclusions of a new analysis published in the March issue of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biw185/3057250/Long-Term-Studies-Contribute-Disproportionately-to"><em>BioScience</em></a>.</p>
<p>"If ever there was a time for long-term studies, this is it, because they are especially important for our understanding of how ecosystems will respond to climate change," said corresponding author Mark Carr, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Carr acknowledged that funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), the leading funder of ecological research in the United States, face a difficult challenge in trying to strike a balance between long-term and short-term studies. Ecologists have grown increasingly concerned, however, about reductions in funding for long-term research. So Carr, with coauthor Peter Raimondi and their lab group, decided to conduct a thorough analysis to determine just how important such studies are.</p>
<p>To assess the value of long-term studies to the field of ecology, the researchers evaluated the relationships between study duration and citation rates (how often a study is cited by other scientists, a commonly used measure of the scientific value of published research). They also looked at the contribution of long-term studies to the citation rates of high-impact journals (a scientific journal's "impact factor" is a measure of how frequently its articles are cited).</p>
<p>The results clearly showed that long-term ecological and environmental studies are more frequently cited than short-term studies. The researchers also found a strong positive correlation between a journal's impact factor and the number of long-term studies it publishes relative to short-term studies.</p>
<p>"Long-term studies are cited more and they show up more often in high-impact journals, which really shows their importance to the science of ecology," said first author Brent Hughes, an assistant researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and a David H. Smith Research Conservation Fellow at Duke University.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;NRC Reports</strong></p>
<p>To evaluate the importance of long-term studies for informing policy, Carr enlisted the help of colleagues at Oregon State University led by professors Bruce Menge and Mark Novak. Their approach focused on the highly influential reports produced by the National Research Council (NRC). Each NRC report provides a synthesis of the scientific literature on a topic for the specific purpose of informing policymakers.</p>
<p>The study found that NRC reports on ecological topics relied more heavily on long-term studies than on short-term studies. In a follow-up survey, the authors of NRC reports overwhelmingly affirmed that long-term studies were especially important for informing management and policy recommendations. The survey also highlighted a mismatch between the demand for such studies and their availability.</p>
<p>"We're hoping that funding agencies will look at this and recognize that the investment in long-term studies is critically important for informing policy and making sound management decisions for our natural resources and ecosystems," Hughes said.</p>
<p>In the past, long-term ecological monitoring programs have been criticized for simply gathering data without addressing important questions. But more recently, Carr said, ecologists have put a lot of thought into how to maximize the value of long-term research programs. "Several papers have made suggestions for how to design good long-term studies, and we summarized those to provide guidance to the scientific community," he said, noting that the projects funded by NSF's Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program have been exemplary.</p>
<p>In practice, said Hughes, the science of ecology requires both long-term monitoring and short-term experiments. "We use data from long-term studies, which allows us to see patterns in nature and develop hypotheses, and then short-term experiments to get at the mechanisms behind the patterns we see in the long-term studies," he said.</p>
<p>Hughes has done much of his research in the <a href="http://www.elkhornslough.org/esnerr/">Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve</a>, and he said one reason it is such a valuable ecosystem for research is the existence of long-term data sets, some going back 80 to 90 years. "For me, it's been crucial to have that kind of data available, and the value of those data sets increases the longer they continue. That's why it's so important to maintain funding for long-term monitoring programs," he said.</p>
<p>This project was supported by the Comparative Analysis of Marine Ecosystem Organization (CAMEO) program, jointly supported by NSF and NOAA Fisheries, the National Estuarine Research Reserve Graduate Research Fellowship, and the David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship through the Cedar Tree Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b0332ac1807270175031728827a7f5ff"><name>mitchell-todd-alumni-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Saving victims of deadly toxic mushrooms</title><summary>Alumnus Todd Mitchell headed a clinical trial on using an extract of milk thistle seeds to overcome toxic mushroom poisoning and developed what has come to be known as the "Santa Cruz Protocol."</summary><keywords>Todd Mitchell, amanita poisoning</keywords><start-date>1488960000000</start-date><display-name>Saving victims of deadly toxic mushrooms</display-name><path>/2017/03/mitchell-todd-alumni-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/mitchell-todd-alumni-profile</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1489014826261</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1489015572735</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/mitchell-todd.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/mitchell-todd.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mitchell-todd.jpg</name><display-name>mitchell-todd.jpg</display-name><file-size>60357</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>When a family of six fell ill after accidentally eating death cap mushrooms in 2007, alumn</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/mitchell-todd-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/mitchell-todd-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mitchell-todd-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mitchell-todd-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3134</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>When a family of six fell ill after accidentally eating death cap mushrooms in 2007, alumn</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>When a family of six fell ill after accidentally eating death cap mushrooms in 2007, alumnus Todd&#160;Mitchell's life changed&#8212;and he began a nearly decade-long quest to get FDA approval for a cure.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alumnus Todd Mitchell headed a clinical trial on using an extract of milk thistle seeds to overcome toxic mushroom poisoning and developed what has come to be known as the 'Santa Cruz Protocol'</article-subhead><article-text><p>Todd Mitchell hates to lose. He hates to lose in beach volleyball and in tennis. But as a physician, he especially hates to lose when it comes to his patients.</p>
<p>So when Mitchell (Kresge &#8217;79, biology and psychology) got a call on Jan. 2, 2007, that six extremely sick members of a Watsonville family were in Dominican Hospital after accidentally consuming poisonous <em>Amanita phalloides</em> (also known as death cap) mushrooms, he went looking for answers.</p>
<p>Googling amanita poisoning, Mitchell found references to doctors in Europe who had successfully treated poisoning victims with an intravenous extract of milk thistle seeds manufactured by a small pharmaceutical company in Germany. The problem was, the drug, called silibinin, was not approved for use in the United States by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
<p>Knowing his patients&#8217; livers were failing and that a liver transplant or death were real possibilities, Mitchell got on the phone. He spent hours hitting roadblock after roadblock but finally convinced the FDA to give him one-time permission to use the milk thistle extract, and a courier was soon on a plane to California with the drugs.</p>
<p>A few days later, everyone in the family but the 83-year-old grandmother recovered. It was an experience that would change Mitchell&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Not only would the 59-year-old family practice doctor head a clinical trial on the use of silibinin for amanita poisoning in the United States, but also some 100 people would be treated using what has come to be known as the Santa Cruz Protocol and he would be called on to lecture on the topic around the world.</p>
<p>Sitting at a caf&#233; table at Staff of Life market in Santa Cruz, Mitchell says his natural pushiness and his penchant for &#8220;having one foot out of the mainstream,&#8221; was part of the reason he was able to save all but one of the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; he says with a smile, &#8220;the one time where my essential nature served me well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mitchell grew up in Chicago and Florida and came to UC Santa Cruz as a rebellious, long-haired 18-year-old who liked the campus&#8217;s tradition of independent thinking and creative problem solving.</p>
<p>It was at UC Santa Cruz that, inspired by working with scientists like the late Charles Daniels, a professor emeritus of biology, and Frank Talamontes, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology, Mitchell decided to go into medicine.&#160; He was working as a hospitalist at Dominican Hospital and treating mostly indigent patients when the family arrived.</p>
<p>Since then, Mitchell, who is now the resident physician at Mount Madonna Center near Watsonville, has been called upon to consult on mushroom poisoning cases throughout the U.S. And, while he says he can&#8217;t reveal exact statistics, nearly every patient in his clinical trial recovered after being treated with silibinin.</p>
<p>He hopes to publish a paper on the results soon.</p>
<p>Mitchell recently returned from presenting at poison control conferences in Singapore and in China, a country, he says, &#8220;that is without a doubt the most highly impacted place in the world for amanita toxin poisoning, where literally hundreds of people die each year.&#8221;</p>
<p>In California, there were 679 cases of wild mushroom poisoning from November 2015 to October 2016, according to the state Department of Public Health. Three people suffered liver failure leading to coma and/or a liver transplant and 50 suffered severe dehydration and damage to their liver or kidney.</p>
<p>For Mitchell, that&#8217;s enough reason to have devoted nearly a decade of his life to getting FDA approval for silibinin, despite the fact he&#8217;s a family practice doctor and not a research physician, and doesn&#8217;t have a big pharmaceutical company behind him. Instead, he says, the study is overseen by Dignity Health, which operates Dominican Hospital and 38 other acute-care facilities in three states.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always had a strong drive to be able to make an impact. I&#8217;ve always had a strong interest in international and public health,&#8221; Mitchell says.</p>
For him, the chance to permanently change the way amanita poisoning is treated in the U.S. and around the world &#8220;is the greatest gift medicine could give back to me.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b55ecc9d8072701750317288f1821986"><name>giving-day-2017-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Giving Day 2017 raises more than $520,000 for a wealth of worthy projects</title><summary>The spirit of friendly competition added excitement to this 24-hour online giving fest, which raised money for a wide array of good causes.</summary><start-date>1489100400000</start-date><display-name>giving day 2017 feature story dw</display-name><path>/2017/03/giving-day-2017-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/giving-day-2017-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1489101571797</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1489610363141</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/GivingDayGroupShotCropped.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/GivingDayGroupShotCropped.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>GivingDayGroupShotCropped.jpg</name><display-name>GivingDayGroupShotCropped.jpg</display-name><file-size>61894</file-size><width>400</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/Giving2017Thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/Giving2017Thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Giving2017Thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Giving2017Thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>5236</file-size><width>75</width><height>75</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The spirit of generosity was strong during Giving Day 2017.

They fished out 50 cents from their pockets, or laid out crisp $20 bills on the table.</p>
<p>And the end result was this: by the end of Giving Day 2017, a 24-hour online giving fest at UC Santa Cruz, donors raised more than $520,000 for 118 worthy projects ranging from stamping out hunger to helping young women on their way to success in STEM careers.</p>
<p>These donors did more than just improve on last year&#8217;s success. They surpassed last year&#8217;s total fundraising figure&#8212;$340,000&#8212;by early afternoon. And then the numbers just kept ticking up and up.</p>
<p>The grand total is more impressive considering that the 5,642 gifts included a large number of "microdonations"&#8212;modest-sized but impactful gifts that broaden UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s culture of philanthropy.</p>
<p>While many donors gave to specific projects, others gave to <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/724/department/2065">a fund called &#8220;Area of Greatest Need</a>,&#8221; giving the university the discretion to use the money where it is needed the most. This was the case with UC Santa Cruz staff member David Schulkin, who works in the Recreation Department. &#8220;There are so many good causes that I thought, &#8220;Aw, shoot, I can&#8217;t decide!'&#8221; he said, pausing at the Giving Day &#8220;pop-up&#8221; booth on the East Field.</p>
<p>Many other donors had a similar notion; by the end of the day, &#8220;Area of Greatest Need&#8221; had raised close to $16,000, with 100 individual gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Every gift counts</strong></p>
<p>Every gift was tallied, and every gift counted. Sid Verma (College Ten &#8217;18, computer science) said even small contributions would help make the Holi Festival, scheduled for April 14, a success. Holi, an ancient Hindu religious celebration, is known as the Festival of Colors or the Festival of Love.</p>
<p>Each donation was also a form of engagement with the event, Verma pointed out. Each donor would, in some way, be invested in the festival and more likely to take part. &#8220;This raises awareness about the festival,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t really expect to get huge donations. Everything helps, even if it is 50 cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walking through Quarry Plaza on Giving Day, potential donors could see a wide array of booths and tables. Two students, Katie Alibrio and Rachel Norton, were out taking cash donations for <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/724/department/2121">Students For Haiti Solidarity</a>, a nonprofit organization raising money for college students in Haiti. Gifts to this organization have an oversized impact; the group aims to raise enough scholarship money to fully fund five Haitian students this year.</p>
<p><strong>Friendly competition</strong></p>
<p>Part of the fun and nail-biting suspense of Giving Day comes from the "real-time" aspect as well as the friendly competition between projects. For example, <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/724/department/2166">Formula Slug,</a> a student-run, nonprofit sustainable engineering organization, won this year&#8217;s &#8220;Mad Dash&#8221; Challenge, which went from 6&#8211;8 p.m., adding $2,500 to their project. Formula Slug also won the Final Frenzy Challenge and bonus $10,000.&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/239/department/350">Undocumented Student Services</a> also put in an amazing showing on Giving Day. The organization, which provides much-needed services and support to ensure the graduation and retention of undocumented students at UC Santa Cruz, took second place in the number of donors for the Final Frenzy Challenge. The STEM Diversity office, which runs programs that help undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the sciences pursue STEM research, also led a project that raised funds for research opportunities for AB540 and DACA students. The combined funds raised by both projects was $31,000&#8212;an impressive figure even by the standards of the day.&#160;</p>
<p>And what can account for this year&#8217;s success? Keith Brant, vice chancellor of University Relations at UC Santa Cruz, said the 2017 event built on last year&#8217;s success. &#8220;Our team took what they learned from last year and made this year even better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe that we are pioneering the grassroots approach to giving days in higher education.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the sheer number of funded projects has helped UC Santa Cruz create &#8220;a new tradition of nontraditional thinking&#8221; around philanthropy.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the event was the talk of the town, with patrons murmuring about competitive fundraisers at coffee shops all over Santa Cruz, and social media lighting up with &#8220;thank you&#8217;&#8217; messages as well as exhortations to keep on giving. <a href="http://calteach.ucsc.edu">Cal Teach UC Santa Cruz</a> , part of a systemwide program for undergraduate science, math, and engineering majors who want to be teachers, sent out a message of thanks on Twitter for $5,000 in gifts that will go toward its student internship program.</p>
<p>Donors stepped up in a big way. By midnight, <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/724/department/2088">UC Santa Cruz Women&#8217;s NCAA Basketball</a> raised about $14,000, <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/724/department/2156">Art in the Arboretum</a> raised $21,000, the <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/724/department/2094">Scholarship For Military Veterans</a> had received nearly $8,000 in matching gifts. People came out in force to support <a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/giving-day/724/department/2160">Girls In Engineering</a>; matching gifts exceeded $6,000.</p>
<p>And the gifts keep coming in, and are gratefully accepted. The message was loud and clear: Anyone can be part of a culture of generosity.</p>
<p>A few hours after the give-fest began on Wednesday, Marissa Salazar (Merrill &#8217;18, sociology) donated to a fund that supports women in the sciences at UC Santa Cruz. Her gift was in honor of International Women&#8217;s Day, which fell on the same day as Giving Day.</p>
<p>Salazar likes the concept of microdonations. &#8220;You don&#8217;t feel pressure to make a huge donation, but they already have hundreds of thousands of dollars so far, which is awesome. And it&#8217;s only noon!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b9a50ff38072701750317288293bfa78"><name>crochet-coral-reef-crochet-circle</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reef madness: A coral grows at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Hundreds of students and community members are contributing their handiwork to the Crochet Coral Reef, a massive participatory art project that combines higher geometry with handicraft while calling attention to the disappearing wonders of the marine world.</summary><keywords>Crochet Coral Reef</keywords><start-date>1489132800000</start-date><display-name>Reef madness: A coral grows at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2017/03/crochet-coral-reef-crochet-circle</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/crochet-coral-reef-crochet-circle</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1489173285312</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1489173520646</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>StoryCruz</value><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed><iframe frameborder="no" height="450" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/311731804&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe></embed><width/><caption>StoryCruz sat in on one of UC Santa Cruz's student-led crochet circles, which are part of the Crochet Coral Reef satellite project.

<p>The Crochet Coral Reef is a massive participatory art project that was created in 2005 by the sisters Christine and Margaret Wertheim of the Institute for Figuring, a Los Angeles&#8211;based organization that delves into the aesthetic and poetic aspects of the sciences.</p>
<p>Since then, the project has spread across the globe. In fact, the Crochet Coral Reef is the biggest participatory science and art project on Earth at the moment, according to the Wertheim sisters.</p>
<p>The Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery is running <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu/events/2016/crochet-coral-reef-co2ca-co2la-ocean-february-10-may-6-2017">an exhibition</a> of the Wertheim sisters' art, <em>Crochet Coral Reef: CO2CA-CO2LA Ocean</em>, through May 6, 2017. The exhibit features the coral reef crochet of the Wertheim sisters and their collaborators.</p>
<p>The sisters, who grew up in Queensland, Australia, near the Great Barrier Reef, describe it as a worldwide &#8220;wooly celebration of the intersection of higher geometry and feminine handicraft, and a testimony to the disappearing wonders of the marine world.&#8221; Since the project&#8217;s humble beginnings, it has expanded to include &#8220;satellite coral reef&#8221; projects in 35 cities and countries worldwide, and as far-flung as Ireland, Germany, and Latvia.</p>
<h3>Santa Cruz satellite</h3>
<p>One of those satellites has been established at UC Santa Cruz, under the auspices of&#160; UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences (IAS), which is funding and organizing the project.</p>
<p>&#160;So far, more than 200 UC Santa Cruz students, and 200 area residents, have contributed to the satellite reef, which will go on display at the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> starting on May 4, 2017. The participants are hoping the display will look like a three-dimensional grotto of coral.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to call the satellites spin-off projects because each satellite reef is part of one enormous whole. In this sense, the project mirrors nature; every coral reef is the work of thousands of tiny organisms.</p>
<h3>Crochet soiree</h3>
<p>One chilly January evening at UC Santa Cruz, a group of crochet enthusiasts&#8212;a dozen students and four Santa Cruz community members&#8212;met for a student-led crochet circle at a multipurpose space known as the Red Room at Rachel Carson College to work on the satellite project. They concentrated on their work, adding wooly flourishes to the simulated reef.</p>
<p>Some students sat stock-still, in total silence, as they worked, while others chatted away. &#8220;I want to be spontaneous,&#8221; one whispered to a friend. &#8220;I want to go against the grain. I love how free-spirited this is!&#8221;</p>
<p>No one in the crochet circle strives for absolute perfection. To do so would be unnatural.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something really beautiful about (the fact that) organic patterns aren&#8217;t perfect,&#8221; said Sarah Skikne, a Ph.D. student in environmental studies, and a 2016 Switzer Environmental Fellow, awarded for her research in environmental science. &#8220;You make mistakes and you add mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Artmakers say the reef-building experience is deeply meditative and a great excuse to shut off annoying smartphones and other devices. &#8220;It is a material thing that demands the attention of your eyes and hands in a continuous way so you can't really get distracted by other things,&#8217;&#8217; said Sophia DiMatteo (Merrill &#8217;17, history of art and visual culture), one of three interns selected for year-long paid internships with the IAS. DiMatteo and fellow interns Gracia Brown (College 10 &#8217;18) and Lucy Ashton (Kresge &#8217;18,&#160; history of art and visual culture) are leading the student crochet circles.</p>
<h3>Replicating life forms</h3>
<p>But the project is more than just relaxing. The crocheting circles heighten awareness of coral reefs and their plight, while emphasizing the power of positive action, said Rachel Nelson, curator and program manager at the IAS. She also teaches in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department.&#160; At the same time, she said, &#8220;this is a way to talk about the science and math of coral reefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the crocheting circles use a method that allows them to make fanciful but convincing re-created life forms. The technique, developed in 1997 by Cornell mathematician Daina Taimina, is called &#8220;hyperbolic crochet.&#8221;</p>
<p>By following a surprisingly basic algorithm, but also varying and &#8220;mutating&#8221; the pattern, the crochet artist can replicate the squiggles of &#8220;brain coral,&#8221; and make all sorts of fringed, loopy, curly, swirly, crenelated forms that can be found in life forms under the sea.</p>
<p>In the Red Room, members of the Santa Cruz community sat next to their undergraduate cohorts, offering advice and chatting freely. One of them, Kathleen Roberts (Cowell &#8217;71, art), loves the free-form aspect of the project. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taught so many people how to crochet,&#8217;&#8217; she said, referring to UC Santa Cruz students involved with the project. &#8220;Most have never crocheted before, but their pieces are going to be (part of the project.)&#8221;</p>
<p>That imperfection is perfectly fine with Roberts<strong>,</strong> who says that crocheting is supposed to be &#8220;funky. Overplanning simply doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roberts is happy with the "come one, come all" aspect of the crocheting circles, which have been meeting weekly. She was amazed when she showed up to one of the early sessions for the coral reef project on campus, &#8220;and there were 175 people at Stevenson College, and all this yarn.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Men with yarn</h3>
<p>Though the website describes crocheting as a feminine handicraft, the crocheting circles have attracted an unusual number of male student participants, Nelson said. &#8220;And a fair amount of them already knew how to crochet&#8221; before joining the circles, she added. &#8220;It took away the gender expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nelson said that in any given satellite project, only 3 percent of the participants are men. &#8220;At UC Santa Cruz, it&#8217;s more like 30 percent,&#8217;&#8217; she said.</p>
<p>She attributed that high participation to an art course taught by Art Department lecturer Kathleen Perry, who asked her students to take part in the Crochet Coral Reef.</p>

She was also a co-organizer of International Women&#8217;s Day, &#8220;A Day Without a Woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon, Perez, who attended UC Santa Cruz in the late '90s as a psychology major (Rachel Carson College [formerly College Eight]), will return to Santa Cruz to deliver her <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ur-keynote-event/">keynote address</a> as part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/">Alumni Weekend 2017</a> festivities, which take place April 28&#8211;30.</p>
<p>The keynote, at the Cocoanut Grove, is $35, or $40 combined with a <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ur-block-party/">pre-keynote Kick-Off Party/Beer Garden</a>. During her speech, she will talk about the origins of her activism, the role and importance of protest, and why her optimism is undimmed. &#160;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>Perez, calling from Phoenix, Arizona, in the midst of a busy speaking tour, talked about her key role in a movement that began to take shape the moment Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. &#8220;January 21<sup>st</sup> turned into a powerful day when millions came out all over the world to demonstrate radical resistance,&#8221; said Perez. &#8220;The march was just a catalyst for many to get involved. The work really began after the march, and what we created was an entry point for people to be part of a larger movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seventy percent of the people at the march had not been to a demonstration before the Women&#8217;s March, Perez said.</p>
<p>"And now people are showing up to protests at airports, fighting against the Muslim ban,&#8221; she said. &#8220;(Because of public outcry), the government was not able to carry out the executive order the way it wanted to. What we are seeing is a new wave of activists, and our role is to channel the rage, the anger, into action.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Origins of a movement</h3>
<p>The epic march drew millions of participants across the nation&#8212;and around the globe&#8212;but it began modestly; in early November of last year, Teresa Shook, a retired lawyer and grandmother who lives on the island of Maui, published a Facebook page, venting frustration about the election results and making a fateful proclamation: &#8220;I think we should march.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shook posed a provocative question: Could women show up in Washington en masse to stage a protest on Inauguration Day? Initially, she extended the invitation to only 40 people or so, but the initial trickle of interest soon became a torrent; within 24 hours, people clicked on &#8220;attending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Around the same time that Shook made her fateful Facebook post, Perez, executive director of The Gathering for Justice, a New York&#8211;based civil rights organization, was joining forces with Bob Bland, who became co-chair of the march.</p>
<p>As the movement took off, Perez signed on as one of the four key women planning the demonstration&#8217;s logistics. In short order, she found herself part of a coast-to-coast movement, and in the spotlight as one of the march&#8217;s public faces. &#8220;Our role, really, was to ensure that the most marginalized communities in America, the targets, were the people we were representing in this march," Perez said. Perez, who is Latina, pointed out that other key organizers include black and Muslim civil rights activists.</p>
<p>Perez, who was also the keynote speaker at last year&#8217;s <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/05/chavez-convocation.html">Cesar Chavez Convocation</a>, held in May on campus, had long been a force in feminist causes before the march began to take shape. A traumatic event galvanized her early activism. After the death of her 19-year-old sister when she was 17, Perez began dedicating her life to creating programs and initiatives that would help transform the lives of young people.</p>
<p>Her years at UC Santa Cruz inspired her, in large part because of A&#237;da Hurtado, whose Chicana feminism class was a political and spiritual awakening for Perez.</p>
<p>&#8220;She gave me an identity that I thought existed but I never knew how to articulate it before,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;It was really important for me to see myself as a feminist in a world that constantly erased our stories.&#8221; Perez made a point of inviting Hurtado, who now holds the endowed chair of the Chicano Studies Department at UC Santa Barbara, to speak at the Women&#8217;s March.</p>
<h3>A history of community activism</h3>
<p>After attending UC Santa Cruz, Perez became a staff member for Barrios Unidos in Santa Cruz, which offers training in non-violence as well as re-entry services for the incarcerated.</p>
<p>A face-to-face meeting with the legendary entertainer and activist Harry Belafonte only increased her focus and resolve. At the time, Belafonte was putting together an organization called The Gathering for Justice and organizing marginalized communities in non-violent actions across the country. Soon afterward, Belafonte asked Perez to join him.&#160;</p>
<p>While working at both Barrios Unidos and The Gathering, she started crafting her own programs focused on young girls and youth justice. In 2006, Perez became a bilingual probation officer with the Santa Cruz County Probation Department, working to provide appropriate programs and re-entry services for young women in the juvenile justice system.</p>
<p>In 2008, she became national organizer of The Gathering for Justice; two years later, she was named executive director.</p>
<p>In November 2013, she founded Justice League NYC, a task force of juvenile and criminal justice advocates, experts, artists, and formerly incarcerated individuals brought together to build &#8220;Growing Up Locked Down&#8221; (GULD), a three-day juvenile justice conference. And in early October 2016, she expanded Justice League to California.</p>
<p>Perez led the March2Justice, a 250-mile march through five states from New York City to Washington, D.C., which drew Congressional attention to key legislative reforms to confront the national crisis in police violence.</p>
<p>A respected expert in the field of juvenile and criminal justice and system accountability, Perez was invited to testify before the President&#8217;s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, was a featured speaker and co-convener of Justice Or Else! The Million Man March 2015 20th anniversary, and has been featured in numerous media and TV outlets.</p>
<p>In her role as the national co-chair of the Women&#8217;s March on Washington, Perez&#8217;s work drew more than 5 million people across the globe to march, said Perez, "in resistance of hatred and bigotry, affirming women of all identities&#8217; rights as human beings."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c9a1c7c48072701750317288a1e3a0f6"><name>swipes-for-slugs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Swipes for Slugs</title><summary>The Dean of Students Office in collaboration with the Global Food Initiative and UCSC Dining is set to launch Swipes for Slugs this week.</summary><start-date>1488873600000</start-date><display-name>Swipes for Slugs</display-name><path>/2017/03/swipes-for-slugs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/swipes-for-slugs</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1489441505735</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1489447764631</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/slugswipes.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/slugswipes.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slugswipes.jpg</name><file-size>83491</file-size><width>350</width><height>142</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Dean of Students Office in collaboration with the Global Food Initiative and UCSC Dining is set to launch Swipes for Slugs this week.

The researchers also found that startled beaked whales fleeing human noises use 30.5 percent more energy during the flight, suggesting that the high cost of escape could contribute to recent dolphin and whale strandings.</p>
<p>Diving marine mammals must balance speed and the duration of breath-hold with the need to conserve limited oxygen reserves, leaving them vulnerable when they try to escape from perceived threats. "Amazingly, there has been only a handful of studies that have actually measured the energetic cost of a dive for dolphins or whales," said Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Williams is fascinated by how marine mammals balance their energy demands with their finite oxygen supply. Explaining that fleeing dolphins beat their fins continually when swimming full-out, while adopting a more leisurely burst-and-glide style during a routine dive, Williams said she wondered just how much energy each swimming style uses and how much energy a startled animal might use when evading peril.</p>
<p>In a paper published March 15 in the <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org"><em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em></a>, Williams and her colleagues reported the energetic costs of different swimming strokes for trained dolphins and other cetaceans. Using that data and previously reported observations of wild Cuvier's beaked whales fleeing from low-frequency sonar, they were able to calculate how much more energy the beaked whales expended in their efforts to escape the noise.</p>
<p>Working with a team of expert trainers, Williams and her colleagues spent over 6 months training six bottlenose dolphins that had previously worked with the U.S. Navy to participate in swimming tests that would allow the scientists to measure the metabolic costs of the different swimming styles. In the first test, the dolphins learned to swim at their most comfortable speed while pushing against a force plate in the wall of the pool as the researchers filmed the number of fin beats. The second test required the animals to dive down 10 meters wearing a fin-beat tracker and swim through a series of hoops before returning to the surface.</p>
<p>Williams was able to take advantage of the animals' marine lifestyle to directly measure the metabolic cost of each dive by training the animals to surface in an air dome where she could record how much oxygen the animals inhaled as they recharged the oxygen stores that they had consumed while swimming. When Williams included killer whales in the metabolic measurements, she had to build an outsized 1.7-square-meter respiration dome to accommodate the larger animals.</p>
<p>After months of patience, the team was eventually able to calculate that bottlenose dolphins consume 3.3 Joules per kilogram per stroke during routine swimming, but the energy consumption almost doubles to 6.4 J/(kg stroke) when swimming their hardest. When the team added the killer whales' fin-beat cost to a plot including the swimming costs of bottlenose dolphins, harbor porpoises and beluga whales, they finally had a tool that they could use to estimate the diving costs of any cetacean.</p>
<p>But what are the conservation implications of the increased cost of each fin beat when whales and dolphins need to avoid danger? Loud man-made noise pollution is thought to be responsible for some mass strandings, so Williams contacted Brandon Southall, a research associate at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, who had recorded how a Cuvier's beaked whale reacted to 20 minutes of loud sonar. With the recording showing that the whale's fin-beat pattern increased significantly, from about 13.6 to 16.9 strokes per minute, she calculated that the startled animals would use 30.5 percent more energy as their metabolic rate rocketed to power the fleeing animals' fin beats. And the whale did not recover swiftly, continuing to use the most costly fin beats for almost two hours after the noise stopped.</p>
<p>"Not all strokes are the same in terms of energy expenditure for swimming dolphins, and this has enormous implications for the cost of flight from aversive stimuli by wild cetaceans," Williams said. "In view of the number of cetacean mass strandings across the globe and the increase in human presence in the oceans, such data are critical. The animals in our care provided that opportunity."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cefbfa53807270175031728847c52cf4"><name>us-news-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grad programs rank among best in nation</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz graduate programs in literature, engineering, and education ranked among the nation’s best in a new survey by "U.S. News and World Report."</summary><keywords>rankings, us news and world report, english, engineering, education</keywords><start-date>1489474800000</start-date><display-name>Rankings</display-name><path>/2017/03/us-news-rankings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/us-news-rankings</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1489531302858</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1489544710104</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Marc DesJardins</name><title></title><phone/><email>madesjar@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/admissions-group-500px.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/admissions-group-500px.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>admissions-group-500px.jpeg</name><display-name>admissions-group-500px.jpeg</display-name><file-size>159035</file-size><width>704</width><height>487</height></image><image-alt>Students on campus</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz graduate programs in literature, engineering, and education ranked among the nation&#8217;s best in a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools?int=978d08&amp;int=ac3a09">new survey</a> by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>.</p>
<p>The media company&#8217;s &#8220;Best Graduate Schools 2018&#8221; guide evaluated graduate schools for business, education, engineering, law, medicine, and nursing, as well as social sciences and humanities. Each area was then broken down into specialties.</p>
<p>UC graduate schools were found in nearly all of the rankings, which were released today. At UC Santa Cruz, the Literature Department received the highest ranking, landing 35th among graduate programs. The Baskin School of Engineering was 85th among engineering schools while the UCSC Education Department was 101st in the education ranking.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Best Graduate Schools rankings&#8221; were based on expert opinions about program excellence and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a school&#8217;s faculty, research output, and student achievement. The data came from statistical surveys sent to administrators at more than 1,970 graduate programs and from reputation surveys sent to more than 16,500 academics and professionals in the disciplines.</p>
<p>Graduate programs in the sciences were last ranked by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> in 2014. In those rankings, UC Santa Cruz was 16th in Earth sciences, 39th in physics and 55th in biological sciences.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cf278a5580727017503172887468883f"><name>grad-applications</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Graduate applications hit new high</title><summary>The Office of Graduate Studies has received 4,744 applications for the 2017-18 academic year.

<p>The Office of Graduate Studies has received 4,744 applications for the 2017&#8211;18 academic year. In the last five years, the campus has marked a 36 percent increase in the number of applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing strong interest in our PhD programs, along with a remarkable surge in in international and domestic applicants for our masters programs. New programs in fields such as Feminist Studies, Computational Media, Scientific Computing, and Latin American and Latino Studies are also helping to make UC Santa Cruz a preferred graduate destination,&#8221; noted Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Tyrus Miller.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of graduate students has been a priority for UC Santa Cruz, as these bright minds are the next generation of professors, innovators, creative artists, and leaders. While they study at UC Santa Cruz, they are an integral part of the research and education mission of the campus.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz offers <a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/prospective-students/Programs.html">33 doctoral degrees</a> and 26 master&#8217;s degrees across its five academic divisions: arts, engineering, humanities, social sciences, and physical and biological sciences.</p>
<p>In fall 2016, 1,821 graduate students were working toward advanced degrees. Miller projects that figure to grow to close to 2,000 in fall 2017.</p>
<h3>New degree opportunities</h3>
<p>In fall 2017, the campus will launch two new programs. The first is a two-year master&#8217;s degree in <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/01/coastal-sustainability.html">environmental science and management</a> with a focus on coastal sustainability.</p>
<p>The new computational media program will offer the master&#8217;s and Ph.D. degree and makes UC Santa Cruz the first U.S. university to offer comprehensive degrees in this rapidly growing and deeply interdisciplinary field.</p>
<p>Additionally, the campus is working toward launching new professional master&#8217;s programs in serious games&#8212;the design of digital games for education, training, and problem solving&#8212;and human-computer interaction at its Silicon Valley Campus.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was also one of 28 universities to <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/humanities-next-generation.html">receive funding</a> from the National Endowment for the Humanities to plan and implement changes to graduate education that will broaden the career preparation of a Ph.D. student beyond a career in the academy.</p>

<p>Courses offered in the Canvas prior to this have been part of a pilot in partnership with UCOP. Winter 2017 courses have not moved. Continue to log in through <a href="http://login.uconline.edu/">login.uconline.edu</a> to complete winter quarter course work in Canvas. Please reinforce to your winter quarter students that they should continue to log in this way, and that they will NOT see their spring quarter Canvas courses in the UCOP pilot.</p>
<p>Faculty have options to teach in Canvas right away or continue using eCommons, our legacy LMS, through winter 2018 for undergraduate courses that already have materials in that system. New courses and graduate-level courses should be hosted in Canvas.</p>
<p>Note that a course shell with enrollments has been created in Canvas for all courses in the Registrar's catalog for spring, and any instructor who wishes to use Canvas may do so. I encourage you to adopt Canvas as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Go to the Canvas service page <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/canvas">http://its.ucsc.edu/canvas</a> and the Canvas FAQ page <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/canvas/canvas-faq.html">http://its.ucsc.edu/canvas/canvas-faq.html</a> for important information on accessing the system, how to use the system, how course materials can be migrated, training opportunities, and how to get support 24x7.</p>
<p>Students will receive additional information on accessing their courses and getting help with Canvas prior to the start of spring quarter. It is also important that you reinforce for your students where you will be hosting your spring quarter course content. I recommend providing them with the direct link to your course in Canvas. And remember that students will not see your spring quarter course until it is published.</p>
<p>ITS looks forward to supporting the new opportunities for teaching and learning provided by Canvas. Please contact the Faculty Instructional Technology Center (FITC) with any questions.

The observatory is introducing a new format this season, a <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/main/visit/evening_tours.shtml">Public Evening Tour</a>, which will enable more people to experience spectacular nighttime views of the observatory and its impressive line-up of telescopes, located at the summit of Mount Hamilton, elevation 4,200 feet, 20 miles east of San Jose.</p>
<p>Due to the growing demand for telescope viewings at night for the general public, Lick Observatory has planned a monthly expert-guided tour of the observatory. Starting April 23, groups of up to 40 visitors will get to tour many of the domes and telescopes on Mount Hamilton.</p>
<p>The "behind the scenes" style walking tour of Lick Observatory will start at the main building's Visitor Center at 6 p.m. An astronomer based on Mount Hamilton will be the main guide for the evening. Participants can learn about the unique history of the world&#8217;s first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory, the eccentric California pioneer James Lick, the technology used for observing on different telescopes along the tour route, and current science being conducted at Lick Observatory. Insights will be provided on how we find planets beyond our solar system, how exploding stars teach us about the evolution of the universe, how we discern the nature of galaxies and black holes, how new technologies are used to undo the blurring effects of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, and about Lick Observatory&#8217;s rich astronomical history and bright scientific future.</p>
<p>A highlight of the tour will be visiting the dome of the 3-meter Shane Telescope to see the mountain&#8217;s largest telescope up close. After the walking tour, there will be an opportunity to enjoy the sunset, and the Gift Shop will be open. During twilight, a history lecture about James Lick and the construction of the observatory will be presented. Once the sky is dark (and weather permitting), viewing celestial objects through the historic 36-inch Great Refractor telescope will commence.</p>
<p>Complimentary coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are included with the tour. The event will last approximately 4 to 6 hours. For safety reasons and due to late hours, children under the age of 8 cannot participate; this event is recommended for ages 12 years and up. Visitors should be prepared to walk about one mile during the evening, including taking stairs.</p>
<p>Tickets are $75 per person, available one month prior to each tour at <a href="http://ucsctickets.universitytickets.com/">ucsctickets.com</a>. Tickets for the April 23 tour will be available starting Wednesday, March 22. The new tours are expected to sell out quickly. The Public Evening Tour is offered once a month, alternating between Sunday and Thursday evenings to accommodate a variety of people&#8217;s schedules. Tours are scheduled for the following dates in 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday, April 23, 6:00 pm</li>
<li>Thursday, May 25, 6:00 pm</li>
<li>Sunday, June 25, 6:30 pm</li>
<li>Thursday July 20, 6:30pm</li>
<li>Sunday, August 6, 6:30pm</li>
<li>Thursday, September 21, 5:30pm</li>
</ul>
<p>The schedule for Lick Observatory's other popular summer programs, "Evening with the Stars" and "Music of the Spheres," will be announced soon. Information is available online at <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/summer/">www.ucolick.org/summer</a>.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Quimby Road (lower Mount Hamilton Road CA-130 is currently closed due to a washout). Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO), a multi-campus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz.

<p>"The science and practice of restoration are often quite separate, says Holl, an expert in tropical forest restoration. "Scientific research takes place at a small scale, and we've rarely tried to integrate results on the broad scale people are talking about. There's a mismatch between these really big goals and what's being done on the ground."</p>
<p>For decades, tropical forests around the world have been cleared to make way for agricultural and wood products, leaving a wake of environmental devastation behind. Tropical deforestation is a significant contributor to climate change, generating 12-15 percent of global carbon emissions.</p>
<p>To turn that around, the international environmental community has embraced ambitious forest restoration goals: Thirty countries have signed on to restore areas equivalent to the size of Venezuela by 2020; participants at the 2014 United Nations Climate Summit set a global target of nearly four times that by 2030.</p>
<p>Given the current scale of scientific research, those goals may be unattainable, warns Holl, who advises nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and policy makers around the world and recently authored a "Perspectives" column in Science magazine on this topic.</p>
<p>Most scientific studies are done on relatively small plots&#8212;typically a few acres&#8212;and results are literally rooted in local conditions, making them difficult to scale up to anywhere near the scope of international agreements.</p>
<p>Restoring vast amounts of forest will require major shifts in planning and science, says Holl.</p>
<p><strong>A call to action</strong></p>
<p>Restoration goals need to be tailored by region and employ a multi-stakeholder "bottom-up" approach that engages landowners, NGOs, local governments, researchers, private companies, and indigenous and community groups, says Holl. That will be the key to the development of cost-effective management practices that are practical at a large scale.</p>
<p>For years, restoration has focused on returning ecosystems to "predisturbance" conditions. Today's climate-change goals are broad and pressing, and Holl urges planners to identify locations where restoration of large areas of forest is ecologically, socially, and economically feasible.</p>
<p>Common sense steps include focusing on areas already set aside for conservation, rather than highly productive agricultural lands that landowners likely won't want to take out of production. Similarly, Holl recommends selecting areas that will yield additional environmental benefits, such as protecting water supplies from damage caused by deforestation.</p>
<p>"As we're realizing the environmental effects of deforestation globally, and the local effects on livelihoods, too, the challenge is finding ways to make forest restoration beneficial to humans and the economy, as well as the climate and the landscape," she says.</p>
<p>Tropical forest restoration alone won't solve climate change, emphasizes Holl. "We have to drastically reduce human-caused greenhouse gas emissions." Reforestation yields additional benefits, though, including conserving biodiversity and improving human well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis based on first-hand experience and international collaborations</strong></p>
<p>Holl's vision is based on first-hand experience and collaborations in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and elsewhere. She oversees one of the longest-running, large-scale tropical-forest restoration projects in the world, a 14-year study in Costa Rica that has yielded valuable insights into the science and practice of restoration. Forest recovery takes decades, but most scientific studies last less than five years.</p>
<p>Fourteen years in, she is still learning from her plots. "We just wrote a paper about nutrient cycling in the litter that falls on the forest floor after a decade of restoration," recalls Holl. "What we're seeing now is really different from what we saw after three to five years."</p>
<p>Her team&#8217;s focus has also broadened from forest ecology to encompass economic and social factors. Funding from the National Science Foundation has enabled her team to reach out and engage students from local elementary and high schools, too.</p>
<p>"You can do all the science in the world, but if it's not practical, if people aren't bought in, you're not going to change the way people do things," says Holl. "It's really important to work synergistically."</p>
<p>Holl collaborates with researchers and land management groups in every Latin American country where she works. "It's the people on the ground who know how to get things done," says Holl. Fluent in Spanish, she nevertheless says she relies on her local partners to navigate the governmental systems in their countries.</p>
<p>"When I started, I thought the work was too small scale, and it wasn't integrated with the community," recalls Holl, who proceeded to work differently, developing the "bottom up" approach she advocates for today.</p>
<p>Holl just completed a meta-analysis of academic papers about tropical reforestation, and her expertise is in demand at international conferences. She looks forward to branching out in coming years, spending more time working with international organizations and intergovernmental organizations, and expanding her reach to more countries.</p>
<p>"I see my role as working with people in Latin America who are going into leadership positions," she says.</p>
<p><strong>Act globally&#8212;and locally</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, Holl is committed to landscape restoration in Santa Cruz, where her students get valuable hands-on experience.</p>
<p>"I feel strongly about working where I live," says Holl, who partners with the UC Natural Reserves on the restoration of Younger Lagoon Reserve, located adjacent to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on the city's westside.</p>
<p>Tropical forest ecology is a far cry from the coal fields of Virginia, where Holl did her doctoral research. "It was a steep learning curve. I had to learn a lot about tropical systems quickly," she recalls.</p>
<p>The number of Latin Americans doing high-quality research on tropical forests has jumped in the past decade, which gives Holl hope.</p>

<p>The clock in cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae) is the simplest circadian clock known, yet it has been very difficult to figure out how it works, said Carrie Partch, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a clock that works with just three proteins. The simplicity of that is stunning to me as a biochemist,&#8221; Partch said. &#8220;For over a decade we&#8217;ve had very high-resolution structures of those proteins, but no idea how they interact.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the new study, Partch&#8217;s lab collaborated with the labs of UC Merced biochemist Andy LiWang and UC San Diego biologist Susan Golden. The researchers captured the clock proteins in large complexes and made spectroscopic &#8220;snapshots&#8221; of their different formations using x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Their findings were published March 16 in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6330/1174"><em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>Circadian clocks are an ancient evolutionary adaptation that synchronizes genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic activities with the Earth&#8217;s rotation. Humans instinctively wake when it&#8217;s morning and sleep when it&#8217;s evening &#8212; dictated by our circadian clocks. How that inner clock works is still being discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine if you wanted to see how a mechanical Swiss watch works, but all you had were the individual gears and springs and no instructions about how they went together,&#8221; LiWang said. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t know how the watch runs. You have to see all the parts interacting.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Cyanobacteria</strong></p>
<p>Cyanobacteria are among Earth&#8217;s oldest living creatures. Through photosynthesis and oxygen production, these bacteria are likely the reason all other aerobic organisms exist. Their circadian clock orchestrates gene expression for the majority of the genome to regulate daytime and nighttime metabolic processes that enhance fitness and affect their survival.</p>
<p>Cyanobacteria make a perfect subject for structural studies because their circadian clocks can be isolated and studied in test tubes outside their living cells. The researchers set out to capture the structures of the bacteria&#8217;s protein clockwork &#8212; the equivalent of looking at a watch with all its parts assembled.</p>
<p>LiWang, Partch, and Golden and their labs have been working to understand how the three proteins that drive the bacteria&#8217;s circadian clock &#8212; KaiA, KaiB and KaiC &#8212; arrange themselves at different times of the day and how they transition to night. &#8220;The biggest mystery was what the clock was doing at night,&#8221; LiWang said.</p>
<p>Though they are at three different UC campuses, the researchers each brought their individual expertise to the collaboration. LiWang mutated KaiB so it could form stable clock protein assemblies. Partch, an expert in both cyanobacterial and mammalian clocks, carried out the crystallography. Golden, a pioneer of cyanobacterial biology, performed genetic and cellular experiments in live cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>A tricky part of being able to visualize the structures is that the protein assemblies needed to be stable enough to form crystals so the researchers could shoot X-rays through them to produce crisp diffraction patterns. KaiB, though, flips between two different shapes, and is only active when it&#8217;s in an unstable shape &#8212; a situation that until now, made crystallization impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;We mutated KaiB so that it stayed in its active shape, and when we added KaiA and KaiC they arranged themselves around it as they do at night,&#8221; LiWang said. &#8220;We found the secret sauce that allows us to figure out how the springs and gears go together.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were amazed that they obtained crystals within a day of combining the proteins. They also solved an NMR structure of a complex between the active form of KaiB and the domain of a protein (CikA) that transmits signals to regulate gene expression in cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really remarkable that the cyanobacterial clock is so dependent on this rare state of KaiB,&#8221; Partch said. &#8220;The mechanistic information we&#8217;re getting out of these structures is allowing us to piece together how the clock manages to keep 24-hour time. We&#8217;re now looking for similar clues in other circadian timekeeping systems, including our own.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next big step for this team will be to see if they can peer closely at the fully functional, biological Swiss watch as its molecular components move.</p>
<p>LiWang, Partch, and Golden are members of the Center for Circadian Biology at UC San Diego, which provides a networking hub for these three labs to interact closely and to meet with other circadian biologists in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of the labs contributed very different skills and insights that were key to solving these structures and understanding what they mean for the function of the clock,&#8221; Golden said. &#8220;The structures of these complexes show the elegance of the cyanobacterial circadian clock, in which the timekeeping gears mesh neatly with the time-telling &#8216;hands&#8217; of the clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;From these structures, we can understand not only how the mechanism ticks, but also how the information gets out to control the rhythmic turning on and off of genes in the cell.&#8221;</p>
<p>This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, and LiWang also receives funding from the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d9723bf580727017503172885291bb7f"><name>zimmerman-watts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gun safety advocate Shannon Watts to speak at Gabriel Zimmerman Award benefit  </title><summary>Gun safety advocate Shannon Watts will be the keynote speaker at a campus reception to celebrate the life of alum Gabriel Zimmerman.  </summary><keywords>zimmerman, watts, reception, benefit, scholarship, kaun, philanthropy</keywords><description>Zimmerman-Watts</description><start-date>1489647600000</start-date><display-name>Zimmerman-Watts</display-name><path>/2017/03/zimmerman-watts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/zimmerman-watts</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1489706825294</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1489707213256</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/zimmerman-gabe-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/zimmerman-gabe-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zimmerman-gabe-300.jpg</name><file-size>157326</file-size><width>300</width><height>467</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Gabe Zimmerman speaking at a podium</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/zimmerman-gabe-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/zimmerman-gabe-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zimmerman-gabe-80.jpg</name><file-size>6510</file-size><width>80</width><height>78</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Gabe Zimmerman speaking at a podium</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>How do you find hope in dark times?

 <br/>
 Some do that by launching a grassroots movement that grows into a national organization; others create a scholarship to support students who are making a difference in their community. <br/>
 <br/>
 Those efforts are coming together March 23 in a celebration of the legacy of UC Santa Cruz alumnus Gabriel &#8220;Gabe&#8221; Zimmerman (Stevenson '02, sociology). <br/>
 <br/>
 Zimmerman was doing work he loved, serving as the community outreach director for Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (Rep D-AZ), when he was killed in the January 2011 mass shooting that took the lives of six and wounded 13, including Giffords.<br/>
 <br/>
 On March 23, the campus is hosting a reception with a keynote address by gun safety advocate Shannon Watts, founder of <a href="http://momsdemandaction.org">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>. <br/>
 <br/>
 Like many, Watts was deeply moved by Zimmerman&#8217;s death.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I remember the Arizona shooting really strongly,&#8221; Watts said during a phone interview. &#8220;When people who are part of Congress get shot and killed, I thought surely Congress would do something.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 After the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, Watts decided she had to act. She started a Facebook Group that quickly morphed into Moms Demand Action, an organization focused on legislators. In 2013, Moms Demand Action partnered with Mayors Against Illegal Guns to create <a href="http://everytown.org/">Everytown for Gun Safety</a>, the largest gun violence prevention network in the country. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;From the stories I heard from our survivors, Gabe was truly a kind and thoughtful young man, who loved working with constituents and serving others,&#8221; said Watts. &#8220;Like too many other talented young people, Gabe's life was cut short by senseless gun violence."<br/>
 <br/>
 In the days following Zimmerman&#8217;s death, UC Santa Cruz alumni Alex Clemens (Porter, '89, international politics) and Jonathan Klein (Merrill, '89, politics) joined forces to honor his dedication to public service by creating a scholarship in his memory. Every year since 2011, the Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship has presented a student in the Division of Social Sciences with a scholarship in recognition of their commitment to social issues and public service.<br/>
 <br/>
 To boost the scholarship endowment, pioneer faculty member and professor emeritus of economics David Kaun has pledged to match any contributions to the fund made during the reception. <br/>
 <br/>
 Also speaking at the event will be <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/zimmerman-scholarship.html">Yethz&#233;ll D&#237;az</a> (&#8217;12, Latin American and Latino studies and sociology), the inaugural Zimmerman Scholar. D&#237;az is now the leader of the People, Projects, and Leadership initiative at Digital NEST, a community organization started by alum Jacob Martinez (Oakes '04, ecology and evolutionary biology). Digital Nest aims to bridge the digital divide in California&#8217;s agricultural regions, serving underrepresented communities and fostering stability and growth through youth development.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Living in a democracy affords us the right to get involved and make change,&#8221; said Watts, who urges people to become involved with issues impacting their local communities. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;The only thing to fight back with is our voice and our vote,&#8221; added Watts. &#8220;We have to be louder and larger than our opposition.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>

<p>The <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/files/EnvisionUCSC-March2017.pdf">report</a>, released in early March, summarizes the many accomplishments in key target areas since the strategic planning process began in the 2013&#8211;14 academic year. It also discusses the goals the campus continues to pursue and the many ways the campus community is working toward addressing those goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Envision UC Santa Cruz has been a helpful process, as it has guided our prioritization of investment and effort,&#8221; said Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Herbert Lee.</p>
<p>Envision UC Santa Cruz focuses on six areas, supported by goals that were developed through campuswide input and collaboration.</p>
<p>The focus areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance and support student success</li>
<li>Allocate faculty resources strategically</li>
<li>Support research excellence</li>
<li>Make UC Santa Cruz a place where people people enjoy working</li>
<li>Tell the world our story</li>
<li>Address workload burden</li>
</ul>
<p>In support of student success, the campus established the Division of Student Success, which is providing campuswide coordination and leadership for student success programs and activities across departments, divisions, colleges, and administrative units. The campus also has worked to better coordinate academic advising.</p>
<p>To allocate faculty resources strategically, the campus has used rebenching funding to hire faculty members who can help grow graduate enrollment. The campus also established the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning in fall 2016.</p>
<p>To support research excellence, the campus provided seed funding to establish the Office of Research Development. Additionally, the campus now has an Office for for Industry Alliances, which is taking a comprehensive lifecycle approach to commercialization and entrepreneurship. Additionally, the Office of Research was reorganized to increase efficiency and incorporate these two new units.</p>
<p>To improve the campus work environment, the campus started new staff recognition programs; held Principles of Community workshops; launched Tuesday Newsday, and reinstituted the Campus Welfare Committee.</p>
<p>In seeking to address workload issues, the Division of Business and Administrative Services expanded its internal process simplification initiative, which has four teams focused on systems that impact units across campus: travel, entertainment, procurement, and hiring. Additionally, the campus has implemented Career Tracks, a systemwide job classification structure that brings the campus in line with UC norms and provides employees with better-defined career paths.</p>
<p>The planning process for Envision UC Santa Cruz spanned the 2013&#8211;14 academic year and was overseen by then-Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eda8896b80727017383538c538819b6a"><name>policy-export-control</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal review of proposed systemwide policy on export controls</title><summary>The Office of the President invites comments on a proposed new systemwide policy on Export Controls. </summary><start-date>1490029200000</start-date><display-name>Policy</display-name><path>/2017/03/policy-export-control</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/policy-export-control</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1490045928408</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1490046022261</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Office of the President invites comments on a proposed new systemwide policy on Export Controls. The proposed policy seeks to provide a framework for all University locations to develop further local export control compliance programs that satisfy federal legal requirements while allowing each location the flexibility to develop its own specific requirements and practices. Compliance with Export Controls requires the cooperation and is the responsibility of various offices and individuals across the University system. The proposed policy identifies some of those offices and individuals and describes some of their responsibilities to ensure that the University follows export control laws and regulations.</p>

<p>The new species, <em>Limacia mcdonaldi</em> (McDonald's dorid), is white with a striking pattern of orange-red coloring on the tips of small stalks and clubs on its body. About an inch long, it is found along the coast from Baja California to Sonoma County.</p>
<p>The new species is described in a paper published in <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12526-017-0676-5"><em>Marine Biodiversity</em></a>, which includes the following section on the species name:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">Named in honor of Gary McDonald, who has spent decades studying and documenting California nudibranchs with exemplary care, precision, and generosity. His review of the nudibranchs of California (McDonald 1983), compilations of the literature, collection of specimens (housed at the California Academy of Sciences), and publicly available digital images have been exhaustive and continue to facilitate our research on nudibranchs from the Eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>Coauthor Jeff Goddard, a marine biologist at UC Santa Barbara, said that as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, he used to spend hours talking to McDonald about nudibranchs. "One of my favorite memories from back then was finding Gary in his office and talking shop about nudibranchs," Goddard said. "I learned a ton from him. This honor for Gary is long overdue."</p>
<p>McDonald worked for the Institute of Marine Sciences for 32 years, doing a little bit of everything until his retirement in 2007. He helped build Long Marine Laboratory in the late 1970s, created the lab's public aquarium (the precursor to today's Seymour Marine Discovery Center), and eventually became the lab's computer specialist. His enthusiasm for nudibranchs was always something he pursued on the side.</p>
<p>Since his retirement, McDonald has maintained his affiliation with the IMS as a research fellow. An accomplished photographer, he posts his photos of nudibranchs, flowers, insects, and other organisms on public natural history databases such as <a href="http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/">Cal Photos</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/sea-slugs.html</url><title>Roses bloom in tide pools: warm water brings southern sea slug to Central Coast</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2b0733180727017383538c5053754f6"><name>cox-melvin-focus-on-africa</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumnus takes students into Africa</title><summary>Melvin Cox's Focus on Africa class has taken more than a dozen students to the continent over the past two years, showing another side of Africa—one that is multiethnic and multicultural, with thriving cities and economic opportunities.</summary><keywords>Melvin Cox, Focus on Africa</keywords><start-date>1490079840000</start-date><display-name>Alumnus takes students into Africa</display-name><path>/2017/03/cox-melvin-focus-on-africa</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/cox-melvin-focus-on-africa</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1490130332869</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1491239721957</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/cox-melvin_edited-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/cox-melvin_edited-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cox-melvin_edited-1.jpg</name><display-name>cox-melvin_edited-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>220884</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>Going to Africa expands students’ worlds in ways that are still evolving, says Focus on Af</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/cox-melvin-thumb_edited-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/cox-melvin-thumb_edited-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cox-melvin-thumb_edited-1.jpg</name><display-name>cox-melvin-thumb_edited-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>22674</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Going to Africa expands students’ worlds in ways that are still evolving, says Focus on Af</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Going to Africa&#160;expands students&#8217; worlds in ways that are still evolving, says <em>Focus on Africa</em> instructor Melvin Cox (Merrill '73, communications).

<p>But there he was, a 19-year-old UC Santa Cruz student, standing in the South African prison that once held Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela and listening to a former inmate describe his own years of incarceration in the notorious Robben Island penitentiary.</p>
<p>The now-21-year-old Stevenson College student, who will graduate this year with a degree in sociology, said the visit was a life-changing experience and that he owes it all to a Merrill College alum who not only had a dream about giving students a chance to see the real Africa but also believed it was his duty to mentor a new generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were people who believed in me, people who made doors open for me,&#8221; says Melvin Cox, a 1973 graduate of UC Santa Cruz, whose <em>Focus on Africa</em> class has taken more than a dozen students to the continent over the past two years. &#8220;They were people who ran the race and, at the end of the lap, handed the baton to my generation. And now it&#8217;s my responsibility to get around the track and make a successful hand-off to the generation that is coming up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cox, 65, who lives in Oakland, is a man with a resume that reflects the passions that drive his life. The son of middle-class parents, he graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in communications. He then landed a job as a television director for a minority-focused news show at a public television station in San Mateo&#8212;despite the fact, he says, he had zero directing experience outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>From there, he worked in public relations and as a substitute teacher. A job as a data analyst at a San Francisco litigation-support firm segued into work as a technical support engineer at a software services company. When he lost his job during the tech bust of 2002 and became a caretaker for his mother, who died at the age of 103, he turned his attention to his twin passions: horses and Africa.</p>
<p>His love of horses, first nurtured when his grandmother gave the 10-year-old riding lessons at a school run by an African American rodeo rider and producer named Thyrl Latting, took him around the world. He visited places like the Heilan International Equestrian Club in China and the Nairobi Polo Club. He also made documentaries about the Badminton Horse Trials in England and the Aachen Horse Show in Germany.</p>
<p>At the same time, he also turned his attention, and camera, to Africa, a continent he first explored in 1987. He became a co-founder of the AFRICAN CONNECTIONS Research and Education Fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a level of ignorance about Africa that is common in America,&#8221; Cox says by telephone from his Oakland home. People believe Africa to be this war-torn and disease-wracked continent filled with poor people instead of a place with thriving cities and economic opportunities, he says. He set out to show another side of Africa.</p>
<p>Linking up with Merrill College Provost Elizabeth Abrams and Smith Renaissance Society founder Bill Dickinson, Cox launched the yearlong, independent-study class, <em>Focus on Africa</em>. Some $40,000 was raised from donations to the campus, allowing 11 students to travel to London, Cape Town, and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania in 2015.</p>
<p>The trip, he says, &#8220;expanded students&#8217; worlds in ways that are still evolving. We saw things that you don&#8217;t hear about in this country. We saw the reality in Africa that not everyone is poor, not every situation is hopeless. We saw a reality that is very multiethnic and multicultural.&#8221;</p>
<p>This spring, the class will examine Kenya and the run-up to its August elections. He also hopes to take five more students to the continent with visits to Ghana, Ethiopia, and Kenya.</p>
<p>&#8220;This class meets Merrill&#8217;s longstanding commitment to having students know the world around them and experience it, a vision embraced by founding provost Philip Bell and shared by benefactor Charles E. Merrill Jr.,&#8221; said Merrill Provost Abrams in a 2015 article about the class. &#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to be able to support students in fulfilling that vision.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://africanconnections.com/focus_on_africa.html</url><title>AFRICAN

But efforts to observe the light emitted by these same galaxies have mostly been unsuccessful. Now, a team of astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile has observed emissions from two distant galaxies initially detected by their quasar absorption signatures, and the results were not what they had expected.</p>
<p>For one thing, emissions driven by star-formation in the galaxies were separated by a surprising distance from the dense gas revealed by quasar absorption, indicating that the galaxies are embedded in an extended halo of hydrogen gas. The estimated star formation rates were also unexpectedly high.</p>
<p>"We had expected we would see faint emissions right on top of the quasar, and instead we saw bright galaxies at large separations from the quasar," said J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and coauthor of a paper on the new findings published March 24 in <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Neutral hydrogen</strong></p>
<p>The neutral hydrogen gas revealed by its absorption of quasar light is most likely part of a large halo or extended disk of gas around the galaxy, said first author Marcel Neeleman, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz. "It's not where the star formation is, and to see so much gas that far from the star-forming region means there is a large amount of neutral hydrogen around the galaxy," Neeleman said. "We don't know if it's in a large, extended disk of gas that's falling in, or if it's just a really dense halo of gas around the galaxy."</p>
<p>The emission spectrum from one of the galaxies does indicate the presence of a rotating disk, Prochaska noted. "These galaxies appear to be massive, dusty, and rapidly star-forming systems, with large, extended layers of gas," he said. "These observations give us terrific insight into how galaxies like our Milky Way looked 13 billion years ago."</p>
<p>For Prochaska, the paper represents the culmination of a quest he began in 2003 with his Ph.D. advisor at UC San Diego, the late Arthur M. Wolfe (also a coauthor on the paper). Wolfe pioneered the use of quasar spectra to study concentrations of neutral hydrogen gas in the distant universe, known as damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems due to the characteristic absorption features the hydrogen gas imprints on the light from the background quasar. Wolfe also saw the potential for ALMA to detect emissions from these systems long before the radio observatory's completion in 2011.</p>
<p>"We've been wanting to do this for 14 years," Prochaska said. "The 'holy grail' has been to identify and study the galaxies that host the hydrogen gas we see in quasar spectra, and it took a facility with ALMA's capability to do it."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Emission signatures</strong></p>
<p>The researchers used ALMA to look for far-infrared emission signatures from the galaxies that they knew could be distinguished from the bright light of the quasars. Ionized carbon emits a bright spectral line at a characteristic wavelength in the infrared (158 microns), which astronomers can use as a tracer of galactic structure in the distant universe. The researchers also observed emissions from dust in the far infrared, which allowed them to estimate star formation rates.</p>
<p>ALMA's configurable array of radio antennas enabled the astronomers to focus their search for galaxy emissions in the area around each of two DLAs, located at a distance of about 13 billion light years. From that distance, the light now reaching telescopes gives astronomers a glimpse at an early stage of galaxy formation, about 1 billion years after the big bang. &#160;</p>
<p>"This is the epoch when galaxies were really starting to take off in terms of star formation--sort of an adolescent growth spurt before reaching the peak of star formation about 2 billion years later," Prochaska said.</p>
<p>The observations indicate that both galaxies are forming stars at moderately high rates, with a star-formation rate greater than 100 solar masses per year for one galaxy and about 25 solar masses per year for the other. The separation from the quasar was about 137,000&#160; light years (42 kiloparsecs) for one galaxy and about 59,000 light years (18 kiloparsecs) for the other.</p>
<p>According to Neeleman, astronomers have assumed that detecting light emitted by the galaxies that host DLAs is difficult because it is hidden in the intense light from the background quasars. Given the large separation of these galaxies from their associated quasars, however, it may be that they are instead obscured by dust, he said. With ALMA, the researchers were able to detect the starlight absorbed and reradiated at longer wavelengths by the dust.</p>

The undergraduate and graduate programs at UC Santa Cruz were both ranked in the top 25 in the company's lists for 2017 of the best undergraduate and graduate schools for students to study game design and launch a career in the game industry.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ranked 13th on the Princeton Review's list of the "Top 25" graduate schools and 21st on the list of the "Top 50" undergraduate programs. The full lists are posted at <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/game-design">Top Game Design Schools 2017</a>. The web site also provides information on the Princeton Review's methodology for the rankings and profiles of the schools.</p>
<p>UCSC offers a broad range of programs in computer game design. The Baskin School of Engineering established the first undergraduate major in computer game design in the UC system in 2006. In addition to B.S. and B.A. degrees in game design, the campus also has three graduate programs with an emphasis on games: the professional M.S. in games and playable media; the Ph.D. or M.S. in computational media; and the M.F.A. in digital arts and new media.</p>
<p>The Princeton Review based its rankings on a survey it conducted in 2016 of 150 institutions offering game design coursework or degrees in the United States, Canada, and some countries abroad.</p>

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A few days after the presidential election, Lindsey Dillon and a handful of like-minded scientists, lawyers, archivists, and academics got on email and brainstormed themselves into action, forming a network to respond quickly to any Trump administration efforts to dismantle environmental policies and agencies.<br/>
<br/>
 Their immediate focus is monitoring federal websites to "rescue" vital scientific data that could be removed from the most "at risk" websites, including climate-change data on the Environmental Protection Agency's web pages. Their longer-term goal is tracking the websites of federal agencies, where "<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/childs-play-team-trump-rewrites-a-department-of-energy-website-for-kids">subtle rhetorical shifts</a>" are already taking place, particularly in descriptions of climate change.<br/>
<br/>
 "The changes we're seeing reveal how this administration wants to change our understanding of climate change," says Dillon, an assistant professor of sociology who studies environmental and economic justice in U.S. cities.<br/>
<br/>
 "These broader, systemic changes in language impact how we will think about climate change and the effects of industry on the environment, and whether and how we can trust what the government says," she explains. "Ultimately, will this administration delegitimize federal agencies and the information they give the public?"<br/>
<br/>
 Immediately after taking office, President Trump took steps to stifle the EPA's official communications. Barely a month later, hundreds of volunteers are flocking to "data rescue" events hosted around the country.<br/>
<br/>
 "This isn't separate from the airport protests [on Trump's proposed immigration ban] or the Women's March," says Dillon. "People around the country aren't accepting what's happening as the new norm. This is one part of that."<br/>
<br/>
 Dillon is chair of the nine-member steering committee of the <a href="https://envirodatagov.org/">Environmental Data and Governance Initiative</a> (EDGI; pronounced "edgy"), the network that coalesced in the days after the November election and has grown to more than 85 members.</p>
<p>"Lindsey leads by listening, facilitating consensus building, and communicating clearly and concisely," said steering committee member Nick Shapiro, a fellow at the Chemical Heritage Foundation who initiated the conversation that led to EDGI. "She's pulling some of our more slapdash grassroots organizational practices into a consistent method."<br/>
<br/>
 Dillon also co-organized a <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/15/volunteers-join-together-effort-protect-federal-environmental-data/">recent data archiving weekend</a> at UC Berkeley that attracted more than 170 volunteers; <a href="http://datarescuesfbay.org/">Data Rescue</a> has 25 similar events planned around the country in coming weeks.<br/>
<br/>
 Data rescuers are focused on preserving public access to rich datasets, including information that is currently available on EPA, NASA, and Department of Energy websites. It's a mission that resonates at UC Santa Cruz, where computer scientists assembled the first complete sequence of the human genome&#8212;and promptly posted humanity's blueprint on the internet, ensuring that it would be freely accessible to all, forever.<br/>
<br/>
 However, Dillon expects the focus to shift to resisting the administration's attempts to cut the capacity of agencies to collect data in the future. "Budget cuts could jeopardize the collection of data," she warns.<br/>
<br/>
 Simultaneously, Dillon is part of a 10-member task force that is interviewing former EPA employees to gather "historical context" for the changes ushered in by previous presidential administrations. They want to gain insight into how previous political administrations cut the capacity of the EPA and measure the impacts of attrition, budget cuts, administration, and regional changes.<br/>
<br/>
 "Lindsey's leadership, and the scope of her engagement, is impressive and inspiring," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. Kamieniecki, a political scientist who specializes in environmental policy, called Dillon a great addition to the faculty on a campus known for its commitment to social justice and environmental stewardship.<br/>
<br/>
 As close as Dillon can come to a identifying a historical moment like today's was the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, which ousted environmental advocate Jimmy Carter. Reagan's election triggered a sense of dread among long-term EPA staffers&#8212;and devastating budget cuts led by Reagan's first EPA administrator Anne Gorsuch, mother of current U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.<br/>
<br/>
 "Still, it isn't even comparable to what we're facing today," emphasizes Dillon, whose long-term goal is to contribute to a positive vision of "robust environmental governance" based on evidence-based environmental policy.<br/>
<br/>
 "In what feels like dark times, I'm putting my energy into something specific," says Dillon. "I'm trying to do something well. I am more hopeful than pessimistic."<br/>
<br/>
 It's a lot to take on during her first year as a faculty member, and Dillon is grateful for support from the Academic Senate's Committee on Research, which provided support that allowed her to hire graduate students Megan Martenyi and Vivian Underhill, who are tracking federal environmental legislation introduced since early January.<br/>
<br/>
 "It's inspiring, and it's certainly not just me," says Dillon. "The stakes are so high. This is why I'm here in this job. I really care about all of these issues. I chose this career to do research in the public interest."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f8b502e780727017383538c5b15f143a"><name>mountjoy-water</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Water wizards: Building an underground savings account to bolster water supply</title><summary>An innovative water-conservation strategy diverts water from overflowing rivers to fallow farmland, where it seeps into the soil and replenishes depleted aquifers. </summary><keywords>mountjoy, alum, environmental studies, sustainable conservation, water, recharge, farm, on-farm, flooding, river</keywords><description>Mountjoy-Water</description><start-date>1490166000000</start-date><display-name>Mountjoy-Water</display-name><path>/2017/03/mountjoy-water</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/mountjoy-water</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1490231295287</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1490299495402</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/mountjoy.cnbc.501.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/mountjoy.cnbc.501.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mountjoy.cnbc.501.jpg</name><file-size>74389</file-size><width>500</width><height>335</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Daniel Mountjoy being interviewed by CNBC news crew.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/mountjoy_thumb_jpeg.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/mountjoy_thumb_jpeg.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mountjoy_thumb_jpeg.jpg</name><file-size>8088</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Daniel Mountjoy</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Daniel Mountjoy was interviewed by a CNBC news crew for a story about "on-farm recharge," an innovative strategy that diverts water from overflowing rivers onto fallow farmland, where it seeps into the soil and replenishes depleted aquifers.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/mountjoy_401.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/mountjoy_401.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mountjoy_401.jpg</name><file-size>46916</file-size><width>500</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Photo of flooded vineyard</image-alt><image-caption>This vineyard was flooded to allow the water to seep into the ground.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>If the sight of this winter's torrential rains left you pining for a way to capture the precious overflows, you are not alone.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz alum Daniel Mountjoy is working to do just that&#8212;on a scale that has the potential to ease the state's increasingly persistent cycles of deluge and drought.</p>
<p>The idea is to divert water from overflowing rivers onto fallow farmland, where it seeps into the soil and replenishes depleted aquifers. These "underground reservoirs" function like savings accounts, storing a valued resource for lean times.</p>
<p>"The goal is balance. We want to redirect surplus water, fill underground basins, and have that water available to farmers during drought years," says Mountjoy (BA, environmental studies, 1985), director of resource stewardship at <a href="http://suscon.org/">Sustainable Conservation</a>, a San Francisco-based nonprofit focused on solving resource management problems.</p>
<p>Mountjoy sees his role as facilitating a unique coalition&#8212;including farmers, environmentalists, academics, and water managers&#8212;that is developing and testing the strategy, called "on-farm recharge."</p>
<p>The strategy is in its infancy, but models show it has the capacity to capture enough river water between November and March to offset 20 percent of the annual "overdraft" pumped out of critical areas of the San Joaquin Valley. "Farmers are interested," says Mountjoy. "We&#8217;re getting calls virtually every day.</p>
<p>Environmentalists are interested, too, embracing the effort to restore the quality and quantity of groundwater and improve wildlife habitat. And state and regional water managers welcome it as a way to meet replenishment goals that are part of the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act.</p>
<p>Sustainable Conservation is working with irrigation districts and 20 farmers of grapes, almonds, walnuts, and pistachios, and the group is aware of many others who are experimenting on their own. "This winter's heavy rains shifted it from a hypothetical to a very timely strategy," adds Mountjoy.</p>
<p>Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, is a leading expert on groundwater and aquifers. Familiar with Sustainable Conservation's work, Fisher says on-farm recharge should definitely be part of the toolkit used to address California's water needs. "They are on the right side of history," says Fisher.</p>
<h2>The origins of an idea</h2>
<p>The first farmer to deliberately flood his acreage was Don Cameron, manager of Terranova Ranch in Fresno County. It was during a 2011 winter storm, and he was afraid his levee was going to fail, so he flooded his land to relieve the pressure on the rain-saturated earthen berms. That got him wondering about the impact it would have on his crops&#8212;and when he detected no downside, he started thinking about the viability of recharging the aquifer.</p>
<p>"Don was able to recharge 3,000 acre feet&#8212;enough water for up to 6,000 California households&#8212;without harming his crops," says Mountjoy. "The concept is valid, so now we're looking at the potential to scale up."</p>
<p>Today, Mountjoy is partnering with Cameron and the Almond Board of California, UC Davis, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and several irrigation districts.</p>
<p>Traditional academic research takes place over many years, but farmers and water managers are eager to move quickly, says Mountjoy, who sees himself as a bridge between researchers and growers.</p>
<p>"This is how I like to work, from the ground up as opposed to the top down," he says. "Those who steward the land often know the issues and the problems, and have ideas about what to do, so it's about bringing them into dialogue with researchers, regulators, and economists to validate and refine the solutions."</p>
<p>California's water woes aren't going away. Climate change models predict less snow&#8212;which historically provided the bulk of the state's water supply&#8212;and more rain. But our capacity to capture heavy rain and snowmelt is limited: Rainfall like this winter's fills reservoirs and man-made lakes, quickly exceeding our storage capacity. Yet the likelihood of building new dams and reservoirs is low: they are expensive, politically fraught, and environmentally controversial.</p>
<p>By contrast, "nature's storage" is an affordable, practical way to store more water&#8212;and it boasts three-times the capacity of all the developed reservoirs in California.</p>
<h2>Draining the accounts</h2>
<p>Farmers have coped with years of reduced surface-water allocations by pumping groundwater, sometimes until wells run dry. The water table has dropped ten to 100 feet in parts of the southern Central Valley over the past decade.</p>
<p>The alarming pace of aquifer depletion led to the state's first-ever regulations on groundwater; they require communities to develop plans by 2020 to bring water supply and demand into balance. Even recharge won't be enough to quench the state's thirst.</p>
<p>"Estimates are that we'll have a winter rain surplus maybe one out of every four years, so on-farm recharge has to be accompanied by conservation," says Mountjoy. "The new groundwater agencies will ultimately have to restrict how much farmers can pump."</p>
<p>"Our goal is to raise awareness and share information," he adds. "We're trying to leverage whoever we can as partners."</p>
<p>Recharge is practical and economical, but it isn't free. Cost estimates are $50-100/acre foot, compared to $1,00-2,500/acre foot for new dam construction. Mountjoy's staff and their partners are busy assessing the suitability of property and the state's water-moving infrastructure; factors include access to irrigation canals and gates, soil quality, and the location of underground basins. Economists are assessing what incentives farmers would need to participate, and how to share the benefits with others, while another nonprofit has stepped up to make all the geospatial data about rainfall and stream flows and site suitability accessible.</p>
<p>Mountjoy notes that recharge has flood-control and habitat restoration benefits, too.</p>
<p>"Before we built the levies, there was water all across the valley," he says. "We want to open up the canals and reconnect the rivers to the flood plains, and do it in a managed way. How can we learn from nature to do things for humans that mimic or build on nature, rather than fighting nature? This is an example of how you can do it. And it's cheaper."</p>
<p>It's a complicated picture with multiple players, plenty of variables, and lots of possibility, which is just what Mountjoy likes about his work.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz taught me to be a systems thinker," he says, explaining that his broad education covered the science of agronomy and agroecology, as well as the social science of human behavior, the economics of cost, policy, and negotiation, and more.</p>
<p>"When I wrote my undergraduate thesis, my adviser Steve Gliessman said, 'This is exactly what we wanted. As professors, we're all steeped in one discipline, but we wanted to present interdisciplinary courses&#8212;we knew you could figure out how to integrate it!' "</p>
<p>In addition to the statewide recharge project, Mountjoy is engaged in stream restoration and water conservation efforts on the Central Coast, including a project with resource conservation districts that provides real-time water-use data to strawberry growers.</p>
<p>"No one organization or individual can make all this happen," says Mountjoy. "It's getting exciting, because everyone is at the table. We have depleted about half of the groundwater that's accessible to us, so there's no time to waste."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fd59c75d80727017383538c514df2c6f"><name>ultraviolet-background</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Universe's ultraviolet background provides clues about missing galaxies</title><summary>A new technique to detect the cosmic ultraviolet background radiation may show why there are so few small galaxies.</summary><keywords>Piero Madau, ultraviolet background, MUSE</keywords><start-date>1490252400000</start-date><display-name>Universe's ultraviolet background provides clues about missing galaxies</display-name><path>/2017/03/ultraviolet-background</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/ultraviolet-background</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1490309202257</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1490309787871</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="231" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPxUKuB5_zY?rel=0" width="410"></iframe></embed><width>410</width><caption><p>This movie follows the formation of galaxies with cosmic time, illustrating how ultraviolet radiation suppresses the formation of stars inside small galaxies.

Their findings provide clues as to why astronomers observe fewer small galaxies than are predicted by models that simulate galaxy formation.</p>
<p>Massive stars and accreting massive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies produce copious amounts of ultraviolet radiation. A fraction of these ultraviolet photons escape from the interstellar medium of the host galaxy into intergalactic space, building up an extragalactic ultraviolet background. This radiation keeps the bulk of ordinary matter in the universe ionized and at temperatures above 10,000 kelvins (17,500 degrees Fahrenheit), and that process regulates star formation in dwarf galaxies.</p>
<p>Until now, however, it has been impossible to obtain an accurate measurement of this invisible radiation. The international team of researchers that solved the problem includes Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, and was led by former UCSC graduate student Michele Fumagalli (now at Durham University). The researchers found a novel way to measure the ultraviolet background light by using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).</p>
<p>Hydrogen gas absorbs a fraction of this ultraviolet light and converts it into visible red light, a process called fluorescence. Fumagalli and his colleagues pointed MUSE toward a nearby spiral galaxy called UGC 7321, which is known to contain plenty hydrogen gas in its outskirts, and detected a faint red fluorescent glow. The inferred ultraviolet light agrees remarkably well with predictions made by Madau, confirming the theory that the ultraviolet background is due to the integrated emission from accreting black holes.</p>
<p>The findings were published in the journal <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/3001962/A"><em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em></a>.</p>
<p>The researchers said their method can be used to measure the evolution of the ultraviolet background through cosmic time, mapping how and when it suppresses the formation of small galaxies. The study could also help produce more accurate computer simulations of the evolution of the universe.</p>
<p>"Our research means we now have the ability to measure and map this UV radiation, which will help us to further refine models of galaxy formation," Fumagalli said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="027e253180727017383538c5bbbb992a"><name>perry-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Prop. 8 plaintiff Kris Perry receives Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award</title><summary>"You only win your civil rights by fighting for them," says alumna Kris Perry, who will be honored at a reception on Friday, April 28. </summary><keywords>perry, award, social sciences, alumni, marriage, civil rights, justice, gay, lesbian</keywords><description>Perry-Award</description><start-date>1490338800000</start-date><display-name>Perry-Award</display-name><path>/2017/03/perry-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/perry-award</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1490395471763</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1491864424333</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/perry_300_jpg.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/perry_300_jpg.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>perry_300_jpg.jpg</name><file-size>44096</file-size><width>300</width><height>463</height></image><image-alt>Photo of the cover of book by Kris Perry and Sandy Stier</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/perry_80_jpeg.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/perry_80_jpeg.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>perry_80_jpeg.jpg</name><file-size>8140</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Kris Perry</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>"You only win your civil rights by fighting for them," says alumna Kris Perry (right), whose memoir, coauthored with her wife Sandy Stier, will be published May 9.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Kris Perry never intended to become a civil rights icon.<br/>
 <br/>
 As an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, she studied psychology and sociology, exploring the themes of social justice that would shape her career as an advocate for children. <br/>
 <br/>
 After more than two decades of behind-the-scenes work, Perry stepped into the national spotlight as the lead plaintiff in the historic legal challenge that overturned California's ban on gay marriage. Perry says she was simply doing what was right and advocating for her family when she joined the case that took marriage equality all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. <br/>
 <br/>
 "What I learned, working very closely with constitutional lawyers, is that you only win your civil rights by fighting for them," says Perry, who never hesitated to join the lawsuit in 2009.<br/>
 <br/>
 "I was excited to be pushing for a solution and to be part of a team fighting for our rights," she recalls. She felt some fear and trepidation, too: The LGBT community wasn't unified behind the court strategy, and so much was unknown, but the support was there. <br/>
 <br/>
 Perry has been named the 2017 recipient of the Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award. She will be honored at a reception at 4 p.m., on Friday, April 28, in the La Feliz Room of the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. Advance registration is available <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4145">online</a>.<br/>
 <br/>
 Perry's life story could have been a case study in one of the classes she took as an undergraduate. More than 30 years later, she still raves about her professors and their ability to link the personal to the political. Sociologist Candace West was "amazing." Marcia Millman was "unbelievable." Merrill College core course instructor Julianne Burton "taught me to write."<br/>
 <br/>
 "They had a way of drawing out students, getting us to open up, and then tying it all back to big themes," says Perry, who had planned to major in psychology but promptly added sociology, as well. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I woke up politically at Santa Cruz," she says. Her first quarter on campus was transformational. She discovered feminism&#8212;and her sexual orientation. She came out, and she began to explore gender equality and civil rights.&#160; &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 Perry began her career as a child-abuse investigator and spent nearly 25 years as a social worker and director of social service programs. In 2005, she was named executive director of First 5 California. Seven years later, she moved to Washington, D.C., as executive director of the First Five Years Fund, a national bipartisan advocacy group that supports the education and care needs of low-income children from birth through age five.<br/>
 <br/>
 Since the election of Donald Trump, Perry is "watching carefully" to see what the new administration may do&#8212;regarding marriage equality, early childhood education, and civil rights. "I've dedicated my career to improving the public good," says Perry. "It's all very much at risk at this point." <br/>
 <br/>
 "I'm inspired by the intersections of politics that are emerging from the Women's March&#8212;and the populist movements on the Left and on the Right," she says. She sees the country moving away from only political parties and toward a more values-based approach, and she is heartened to see people inspired to work in government and "to change the system from within."<br/>
 <br/>
 "It's hard to see government maligned, when in fact government service is noble and profound," says Perry. <br/>
 <br/>
 This spring, she and her wife Sandy Stier are looking forward to the publication of their memoir, <em>Love on Trial: Our Supreme Court Fight for the Right to Marry</em>, which comes out May 9. And Perry was delighted that they were featured in the recent ABC mini-series about gay history, "When We Rise."<br/>
 <br/>
 They are also looking forward to celebrating the graduation in June of their son, Elliott, who is a senior majoring in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I was playing it really cool when he was thinking about which college to attend," recalls Perry. "But when he got in to UCSC and wanted to visit, I said, 'I'm taking him!' He walked away from the tour and said 'I think this is the perfect place for me.' I didn't have to do a hard sell at all."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="029c0cf280727017383538c58e764ad9"><name>excellence-in-teaching</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nominations for Excellence in Teaching Award</title><summary>Is there an instructor who you think deserves special recognition from your spring quarter 2016?

Alexander Gerbode Foundation to create a new composition that will be performed at the acclaimed <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/other-minds-archive.html"><em><strong>Other Minds Festival</strong></em></a> of contemporary music in 2018.</p>
<p>The foundation has awarded six $50,000 grants this year to support the creation and production of new music by &#8220;today&#8217;s most influential&#8221; California composers.</p>
<p>Six Bay Area nonprofit arts organizations will receive a $50,000 grant that will be used for a commissioning fee of $12,500 or more to each composer, with the rest of the funds going to the arts presenters for expenses related to the creation and premiere of the pieces.</p>
<p>All of the new music works will have their world premiere public performances in the San Francisco Bay Area over the next two years.</p>
<p><strong>Baumbusch will create</strong> a new piece titled <em>The Pressure</em> that will be a concert-length multimedia work based on themes of early German expressionism that accompanied the rise of fascism.</p>
<p>The scores will be performed by a mixed ensemble including The Friction String Quartet and The Lightbulb Ensemble, a group of 12 percussionists that performs on a set of instruments that Baumbusch designed and built, and that were inspired by Indonesian gamelan instruments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The piece that I plan to write for the commission will be a continuation of a collaboration that I started with a South African video artist named Chris Bisset, as well as my brother Paul who is a poet/playwright,&#8221; said Baumbusch.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We performed a work that we all collaborated on together this past fall at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, along with a number of my students from UC Santa Cruz and other musicians who I collaborate with in the Lightbulb Ensemble. That piece, called &#8216;Hamsa&#8217; was inspired by the five pillars of Islam, in which my brother wrote five &#8216;tales&#8217; based on each of the pillars, and I wrote an 80-minute score that accompanied a whispered-narration of the tales.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baumbusch said his new work will feature a performance by the Lightbulb Ensemble, set to a silent film created by Bisset and based on a storyline by his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I plan to draw inspiration from early minimalist opera and film collaboration while exploring contemporary social issues,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Whereas <em>Hamsa</em> explored the rich architectural and aesthetic traditions of Islam as a meditation on contemporary religion, <em>The Pressure</em> will explore the fascination with the uncanny through a political lens, focusing especially on the German expressionism of the Weimar Republic and the silent &#8216;horror&#8217; films that accompanied the rise of fascism.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>This marks the second time</strong> that Baumbusch has received a commission grant from the Gerbode Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was involved in a project that was awarded the same grant in 2014,&#8221; Baumbusch noted. &#8220;In that project, the lead composer was Wayne Vitale, and I was a co-composer. We developed an hour-long suite of works to be performed on the instruments that I built by the Lightbulb Ensemble, which was the group that I formed to play on these instruments in 2013.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We premiered this work at the Yerba Buena center in San Francisco,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We went on to record these works as an album, which was just released on <a href="http://www.newworldrecords.org/album.cgi?rm=view&amp;album_id=94509"><em><strong>New World Records</strong></em></a>, along with a piece called &#8216;Ellipses&#8217; that I composed for some of my gamelan students at UC Santa Cruz, which was recorded on campus in 2015.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baumbusch is currently in his third year&#160;pursuing a&#160;doctor of musical arts degree in composition at UC Santa Cruz, where he also directs the Balinese gamelan ensemble. He has also been on the faculty at Santa Clara University for the past year, directing a gamelan ensemble there and teaching several other music courses.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/other-minds-archive.html</url><title>Other Minds donates archives to UC Santa Cruz</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="119e590480727017520a5a2ca710cc23"><name>career-tracks-event</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Career Tracks Event Update</title><summary>Following is a quick update of our upcoming Career Tracks Support Events.</summary><start-date>1490598000000</start-date><display-name>Career Tracks Event Update</display-name><path>/2017/03/career-tracks-event</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/career-tracks-event</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1490649240526</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1490649240526</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Here&#8217;s a quick update of our upcoming Career Tracks Support Events:</p>

<div></div></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Four rallies, many classroom visits, and a legion of inspired student activists
</article-subhead><article-text><p>On a sunny afternoon in May 1973, a mariachi band was playing to a festive crowd in the UC Santa Cruz Quarry Amphitheater when C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, one of the leading social activists of his day, took to the stage.</p>
<p>In what would be the first and largest of several campus rallies headlining Ch&#225;vez and other United Farm Worker leaders, he thanked the hundreds of students and community workers who had helped with an ongoing campaign to improve the lives of farmworkers. Each time, he detailed the ongoing struggle and inspired them to help move the cause forward.</p>
<p>The legacy of C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, who would have been 90 years old this Friday, includes deep and lasting relationships with many UC Santa Cruz alumni, faculty, and staff, whose lives were changed through the nonviolent farmworker movement that started in the &#8217;60s and continues today.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me it was really meaningful to have him come to the campus,&#8221; said Lisa Solinas, who helped organize the 1973 rally as an active member of MEChA de UCSC, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano/a de Aztlan, a student group that, in 1973, had already spent years organizing and leafleting on behalf of farmworkers.</p>
<p>A member of Chicanos for Health Education and the campus Huelga (strike) Committee, Solinas had volunteered at a free farmworker clinic at the first UFW headquarters in Delano. During the school year, she joined other students on the picket line and canvasing dorms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going out two to three times a week to boycott the liquor stores, to boycott Gallo wine. Sometimes we were standing out there in the pouring rain,&#8221; Solinas said.</p>
<p>Now the medical director of three low-income clinics in Santa Paula, Solinas remembers how Ch&#225;vez wanted to bring everyone into the fold. &#8220;I think he was so influenced by Gandhi and the desire for his movement to be a peaceful one for change,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In the years that followed that first jubilant rally, which drew a crowd of 800 to 1,200 people, Ch&#225;vez visited the campus for at least three more packed rallies at critical junctures for the movement in 1976 and 1985. He also visited countless times for intimate classroom discussions where he shared his passion for nonviolent social justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC was a gold mine of volunteers,&#8221; said Carlos LeGarrette, a former assistant to Ch&#225;vez who attended the 1973 rally and later founded Cesar Ch&#225;vez Service Clubs in San Diego, which continues to work with UCSC alumni. &#8220;They were young individuals who were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and wanting to change the world. The farmworkers gave them a place where they could do so nonviolently. The college students were fantastic volunteers in the movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olga Talamante (Cowell, &#8217;73), who grew up in a farmworker family and was a member of MEChA and the Huelga Committee, served as emcee of the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than anything, it was a hopeful time,&#8221; said Talamante, executive director of the Chicana/Latina Foundation in Burlingame, a scholarship and leadership program. &#8220;We were so excited that he came and that so many people showed up. We were putting ourselves on the line and getting other people to do the same to support this very noble cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz, just seven years old, had an activist campus culture. Students had marched military recruiters off the campus and protested the Vietnam War en masse. Many students chose the UFW as an academically supervised field study placement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were ambitious,&#8221; recalls Richard Vasquez (Stevenson, &#8217;73), a MEChA member at the rally with family ties to the UFW. Vasquez, who returned to the campus after graduation to work many years in the campus Educational Opportunity Programs, recalls the hard work of organizing. &#8220;Before he came, we were on the phone. We knew people to reach and we used the phones like crazy in those days.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Ron Pease (Stevenson, &#8217;73, anthropology), who was not part of the campus organizing community, the rally gave him momentum to become more of an activist later in life. &#8220;It was certainly part of the cultural atmosphere then,&#8221; Pease said.</p>
<p>Ch&#225;vez, who often spoke to classes as small as 20 students, showed them that someone could be a scholar and an activist, said Mike Rotkin, former Community Studies lecturer who attended the rally. &#8220;He believed education was the way to change the world, but showed them you could do social activism while in school. The fact that you could do both was an eye opener.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez had a tremendous impact on students and faculty at UCSC over the years,&#8221; Rotkin said.</p>
<p>Paul Ortiz, a former UFW organizer and UCSC Community Studies professor, points to Latin American and Latino Studies and Community Studies as two programs that were heavily impacted by the UFW movement. Ortiz, director of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program and associate professor of history at the University of Florida, will be returning to campus May 16, for the 14th annual C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez Convocation.</p>
<p>This year the annual convocation will shift from its usual keynote speaker format to an interactive panel discussion focusing on organizing and how to bridge diverse social movements.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the grape and lettuce boycotts, ultimately he brought millions of people together&#8212;brown people, white people, Asian Americans,&#8221; Ortiz said. &#8220;The real achievement was unity across lines. We&#8217;re trying to figure out how to bridge these enormous divides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ch&#225;vez legacy is especially important today because the immigrant community feels under attack, said Katiuska Pimentel Vargas, a fourth-year legal studies and politics student and front desk assistant at the UCSC Ethnic Resource Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ch&#225;vez continues to be relevant today,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His legacy shall remain alive. His ideologies for justice continue to inspire and empower our communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer just might be a fascinating UC Santa Cruz Special Collections exhibit that takes a look at the famed Marvel Comics Black Panther series and its connections to black history, including the Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>&#160;Organized and researched by three UC Santa Cruz Ph.D. students&#8212;<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/nelson-archive.html">crystal am nelson</a> (who prefers her name written in all lowercase letters), Cathy Thomas, and Kiran Garcha&#8212;the exhibit includes 45 Black Panther comics that chronicle the mythical African kingdom of Wakanda and its brilliant, black superhero king, T&#8217;Challa, as well as cultural artifacts and a stunningly rendered fan comic commissioned by UC Santa Cruz alumus Jim Gunderson (Rachel Carson College &#8217;77, philosophy) that imagines the circumstances that led to the creation of the series.</p>
<p>The offering is a way, the three grad students say, to mark the 2016 silver anniversary of the comic book series and also to show how the story of a black superhero was not just reflective of African-American lives at the time but, in some ways, was also corrective.</p>
<h3>Turbulent times</h3>
<p>Sitting in a room in UC Santa Cruz Special Collections and surrounded by photos of women in the Black Panther Party taken by famed California photographers Ruth-Marion Baruch and Pirkle Jones, nelson, Thomas, and Garcha detail the times that birthed the comic book series and also black efforts for self-determination and self-sufficiency in the turbulent '60s.</p>
<p class="Body">The three women say Marvel Comics artists Stan Lee and Jack Kirby could not have missed what was happening in the United States when they created the Black Panther character in 1966. Human-rights activist Malcolm X had been assassinated and the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts had erupted in rebellion in response to what was seen as unrestrained police brutality against African Americans.</p>
<p class="Body">&#8220;You have to imagine Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in their (Marvel Comics) office in the garment district&#8221; in New York, says Thomas, who is pursing a Ph.D. in literature and is an ardent comic book fan. &#8220;There is no way that Stan Lee, a Jewish man who had changed his name (from Stanley Martin Lieber) in order to be employable, is not thinking of these things,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>About the same time all this was happening, civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael was in Lowndes County, Alabama, where efforts were afoot to create a third, African American political party in the majority-black county, with its symbol a black panther.</p>
<p>The Black Panther comic-book character debuted in the pages of a Fantastic Four comic in the summer of 1966. In the autumn of the same year, Carmichael gave a speech about black power at UC Berkeley and, a short time later, Oakland-based Huey Newton and Bobby Seale named their movement the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.</p>
<h3>Tapping into the need to represent African Americans</h3>
<p>While some say comic-book artists Lee and Kirby were unaware of the Lowndes County icon, the fan comic created by Gunderson imagines a chance visit between Kirby and a rabbi on a New York train that led to Lee&#8217;s introduction to Carmichael and Lowndes County&#8217;s symbol.</p>
<p>Whatever the reality, Lee and Kirby were tapping into the need to represent African Americans in the pages of their comic books, say the exhibit&#8217;s curators.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had a rubber man, a wasp man,&#8221; says Thomas. &#8220;It was about time to create an intelligent black man who wasn&#8217;t a sidekick.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Lee and Kirby&#8217;s Black Panther imaginings, T&#8217;Challa ruled a mythical kingdom called Wakanda. Its rich veins of a powerful and coveted ore named Vibranium made it a target for those who would exploit the resource. But King T&#8217;Challa and his ancestors used their wealth to educate and enrich the country, with the result that the mythical nation was not only independent and wealthy but also technologically advanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Black Panther Party was trying to create something similar to Wakanda, if not create a real Wakanda,&#8221; says nelson, who is researching the visual culture of desire and pleasure within black communities. &#8220;They weren&#8217;t separatists, but they definitely recognized that if black communities were going to survive and thrive they had to create their own resources and be self-sufficient and self-reliant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This theme of self-determination is very persistent in both comic books and the history of the Black Panther Party,&#8221; adds Garcha, whose dissertation is on the role of women and children in the Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>It was a time, say the women, when African Americans, especially in low-income, urban communities, needed a superhero.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Black Panther character in the comic book and the Black Panther Party both came out at the perfect moment,&#8221; nelson says, &#8220;so you&#8217;ve got this character within a comic-book universe and this live-action version within the Black Panther Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marvel&#8217;s newest Black Panther comic books, meanwhile, are being penned by the likes of MacArthur genius and National Book Award winner Ta-Nehisi Coates, bestselling author Roxanne Gay, and poet Yona Harvey.</p>
<p>For Elisabeth Remak-Honnef, who heads UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Special Collections Department, the exhibit is also an example of the diversity and scholarship opportunities in the campus&#8217;s extensive collections, which not only includes about 1,700 vintage Marvel Comics comic books <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/rev-spring-15-philanthropy-comics.html">donated by Gunderson and his childhood friend, Peter Coha</a> (Kresge &#8217;78, mathematics) but also the Ruth-Marion Baruch and Pirkle Jones Photography Collection, valued at an estimated $32 million.</p>
<p><em>The exhibit at McHenry Library, including free copies of the fan comic titled</em> Seeking the Black Panther, <em>is open until May 1. <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/pictures-and-progress-the-black-panther-1966-2016/index">There is also a digital version</a>.</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/11/black-panther-exhibition.html</url><title>Black Panther exhibition opens Nov. 10 at McHenry Library</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1712426d80727017520a5a2c20fa82d7"><name>arboretum-spring-sale</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Arboretum holds Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 8</title><summary>Gardeners will find hundreds of varieties of drought-tolerant and extraordinary plants at the sale, as well as expert garden advice from the Arboretum's curators.</summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, UCSC Arboretum</keywords><start-date>1490684400000</start-date><display-name>Arboretum holds Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 8</display-name><path>/2017/03/arboretum-spring-sale</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/arboretum-spring-sale</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1490740723013</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1490740927599</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/spring-sale-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/spring-sale-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spring-sale-250.jpg</name><display-name>spring-sale-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>16671</file-size><width>250</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>sale poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/03/images/spring-sale-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/03/images/spring-sale-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spring-sale-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>spring-sale-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20326</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>sale poster</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Arboretum</a> will hold its annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 8, from 12 noon to 4 p.m. at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.</p>

A signing ceremony was held at UC Santa Cruz on March 28 during a visit to campus by CSC officials.</p>
<p>Students in the program will be jointly selected by CSC and UC Santa Cruz, and CSC will provide each scholar with full tuition and a stipend for their first two years. The China Scholarship Council provides support for a wide range of international exchange programs in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>"There is genuine interest on both sides to promote international collaboration and scholarly exchanges. This agreement highlights the growing presence of UC Santa Cruz on the international stage," said UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal, who visited China in 2015 and met with academic leaders at several top Chinese universities.</p>
<p>Liu Jinghui, secretary-general of the China Scholarship Council and president of the China Association for International Education, said astronomy is an area in which China wants to cultivate high-level expertise. China is a partner in the international Thirty Meter Telescope project and is planning new astronomical observatories in China.</p>
<p>"That is why we want to partner with UC Santa Cruz in astronomy," Liu said. "Astronomy is an important field for the whole world, and we are training young people not only for today but for the future."</p>
<p>Sandra Faber, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics who helped facilitate the agreement, said it paves the way for other UC campuses to join the program, now that the terms of the agreement have been worked out in consultation with the UC Office of the President.</p>
<p>"Other UC campuses are now looking at our example and may join in the future, and the University of Hawaii is signing a similar agreement," Faber said.</p>
<p>Prospective candidates for the program will apply first to the UCSC Ph.D. program in astronomy and astrophysics, and those who meet the department's normal selection criteria will then apply to CSC for funding support.</p>
<p>The agreement covers an initial cohort of students starting in Fall 2017, and could lead to a long-term program in the future, as well as other scholarly exchange programs. If successful, the Graduate Student Scholars Program may expand beyond astronomy to include students in Earth sciences and other fields, Faber said. Additional exchange programs, involving CSC support for visiting scholars and postdoctoral researchers, are also under consideration.</p>
<p>According to Faber, the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project was a major impetus for the new program. UC and China are partners in TMT, along with India, Japan, Canada, and the California Institute of Technology. UCSC astronomers involved in TMT have been traveling to China and establishing connections with Chinese institutions. Training Chinese students at UC Santa Cruz, where they can work with faculty and staff who are among the world's leading experts on large telescopes, will ultimately benefit everyone involved in TMT, Faber said.</p>
<p>"Twenty years from now, when we are deep into the TMT collaboration, we will have forged strong connections and partnerships with Chinese scientists," she said.</p>
<p>Faber also emphasized that bringing international students to UC campuses benefits both the university and the state. "It makes UC, and by extension the state of California, a player on the world stage," she said. "If we want to train our students to function effectively in the world, we have to expose them to other cultures so they can gain a global perspective."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="21301d4580727017520a5a2c3d9949f2"><name>wireless-outage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Wireless Outage April 1</title><start-date>1490857200000</start-date><display-name>Campus Wireless Outage April 1</display-name><path>/2017/03/wireless-outage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/03/wireless-outage</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1490910451732</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1490910451732</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This Saturday from 10AM to 2PM, the campus wireless services CruzNet and eduroam will be offline for a system upgrade.
