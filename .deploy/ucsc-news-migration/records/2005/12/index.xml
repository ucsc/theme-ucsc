The findings by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are helping to reconcile the geologic record of magnetic field reversals with the current understanding of how the Earth's core generates the planet's magnetic field.</p><p>Robert Coe and Gary Glatzmaier, both professors of Earth sciences at UCSC, combine studies of the paleomagnetic records preserved in rocks with complex computer models of the "geodynamo" that generates the magnetic field. Working together, they are gaining new insights into the effects on the magnetic field of processes occurring deep within the Earth.</p><p>Coe will present their findings this week at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco (session GP23B, talk #8, on Tuesday, December 6, at 3:25 p.m.)</p><p>The magnetic field arises as a result of interactions in the Earth's iron-rich core, which consists of a solid inner core and a fluid outer core. The flow of heat from the core drives fluid motions in the outer core that produce an electric current and generate the magnetic field.</p><p>On human timescales, the magnetic field reliably aligns compass needles, helps animals navigate, and deflects some of the Sun's radiation. But on geologic timescales, it is far from stable--weakening, strengthening, and sometimes even reversing itself. A reversal of the magnetic field would cause the needles on compasses to point south instead of north.</p><p>In the last 15 million years (a relatively brief interval in Earth's history), the magnetic field has reversed roughly four to five times every million years. But records from the ocean floor indicate that reversal rates have been much lower at various times in the past. In fact, during a period that began 120 million years ago, there are no records of any magnetic reversals for nearly 35 million years, Coe said. </p><p>The geodynamo simulations show that the shape of the magnetic field may be an important factor controlling reversal rates. The symmetry and stability of the simulated field varies depending on the pattern of heat flow imposed at the core-mantle boundary. When the field is symmetrical in Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the simulations show frequent reversals. Conversely, when the field is strongly antisymmetric, with the Northern and Southern Hemispheres displaying opposite features, it reverses infrequently or not at all.</p><p>This finding is consistent with studies by other researchers of the paleomagnetic record of Earth's magnetic field during the 35 million years with no reversals, indicating that it was much more antisymmetric then than it is today. </p><p>The simulation that produced the most antisymmetric and most stable field is one with an inner core only one-quarter of its current size. Scientists believe that as the core cools, iron crystallizes out of the fluid outer core onto the solid inner core, causing the inner core to grow slowly over time. Thus, this simulation mimics conditions deep in Earth's past and predicts that reversals would have occurred much less frequently then than now. A survey of the sparse literature on the magnetic field 2 billion and more years ago suggests that this may well have been the case, Coe said.</p><p>"The data are consistent with simulations showing that field symmetry influences reversal rate," he said.</p><p>The Earth's magnetic field has been weakening for 2,000 years, and that trend continues today, leading some to worry that it may be heading for a reversal. Although the idea of an impending magnetic field reversal has captured the imaginations of writers and television producers, Coe said he thinks that a reversal would be unlikely to produce a catastrophic effect. Furthermore, reversals take thousands of years, and the field has decreased many times in the past and not reversed, he said.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Coe at (831) 459-2393 or rcoe@es.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f5ca98072704601a012ff4417e39f"><name>790</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Unmanned submersible sheds light on an undersea volcano</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>AGU, volcanoes</keywords><start-date>1133766000000</start-date><display-name>Unmanned submersible sheds light...</display-name><path>/2005/12/790</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/12/790</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338151539</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338151539</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Rock samples collected last year show surprising variation in the chemistry of an undersea volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge near Seattle. The variation comes from the mantle, the source of the magma that erupted from the volcano to form the rocks, and may influence the microbial communities that now inhabit the volcano, said James Gill, professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>"By terrestrial standards this is a piddly little volcano, but we're finding more chemical variation per unit area than has been found before in a seafloor volcano," Gill said.</p><p>Gill will present his group's findings this week at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco (session T31A, poster #483, on Wednesday, December 7, at 8 a.m.).</p><p>A remote-controlled submersible called <i>Tiburon</i> collected the rock samples that Gill and others are using to study the volcano. The submersible, owned by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), is connected to the research ship <i>Western Flyer</i> by a fiber-optic cable and controlled by a joystick while it dives to depths of more than 2,000 meters. The ability to collect fragile samples, to know their location within meters, and to see their geological context was essential to the mission, Gill said.</p><p>"The submersible allows us to pinpoint the location of samples and document surrounding rock formations in a way that's impossible with manned submersibles," he said.</p><p>In addition to rock samples, <i>Tiburon</i> also collected hours of high-definition video footage from the ridge site, allowing scientists to view the undersea environment in exquisite detail while sitting safely on the surface. The video footage shows bulging lava formations called pillow basalt and towering mineral chimneys that grow around undersea hydrothermal vents. The vents provide heat and minerals that support an entire food chain of strange undersea creatures.</p><p>The global mid-ocean ridge system is the largest single volcanic feature on Earth and is responsible for the continual renewal of the Earth's crust. Scientists know that the mantle rises and melts in ridge areas, forming magma that ultimately forms new oceanic crust. But exactly where the magma comes from and how it forms the crust remain unclear. </p><p>Gill and his co-workers, including UCSC graduate students Jenni Kela and Jason Woodcock, hope that the rock samples collected by <i>Tiburon</i> will help them answer these questions. Preliminary analysis of the more than 250 rock samples collected by <i>Tiburon</i> shows some surprising results.</p><p>"The volcano looks symmetrical, but we're finding that the basalt rock on the east flank of the volcano cannot have formed from the same magma as the rock on the west flank," Gill said.</p><p>The two sides of the volcano probably formed at different times when the underlying magma had different characteristics, he said. Further analysis will help researchers determine when the rocks formed to draw a clearer picture of how the volcano has acted in the past.</p><p>"We hope to use the chemistry of the rocks and the chronology of when they formed to develop a geologic model of volcano activity," Gill said. "This may help us understand why the mantle delivers so much chemical diversity here, but not in other volcanoes."</p><p>The researchers speculate that the volcano's chemical diversity contributes to the differences in their active hydrothermal vents, and that these differences extend to the biological systems the vents support. This research was conducted as part of a project sponsored by the National Science Foundation that focuses on the geology and biology of oceanic ridge spreading systems. The project, called Ridge 2000, includes scientists from a wide range of disciplines who study everything "from mantle to microbes" to understand how the interior of the Earth ultimately affects life in this novel environment, Gill said.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Gill at (831) 459-3842 or jgill@pmc.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f5e138072704601a012ffb437206a"><name>791</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ancient sediments show influence of southern ocean circulation on climate</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>AGU, climate change</keywords><start-date>1133766000000</start-date><display-name>Ancient sediments show influence...</display-name><path>/2005/12/791</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/12/791</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338151906</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338151906</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>About 34 million years ago, the Earth's climate transitioned from a "greenhouse climate" to the "icehouse climate" of today, forming a massive ice sheet on the Antarctic continent. A new study by Linda Anderson, an ocean sciences researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, suggests that oceanographic features in the Southern Ocean--the intensity of current flow and the amount of stratification (the formation of distinct layers at different depths)--may have played a key role in the transition.  </p><p>Anderson will present her findings this week at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco (session PP41A, poster #633, on Thursday, December 8, at 8 a.m.).</p><p>Anderson analyzed the chemical properties of seafloor sediments laid down millions of years ago to piece together a picture of how Southern Ocean circulation may have looked deep in the past. The periods covered in her study include the transition from the Eocene to the Oligocene epochs about 33 million years ago and a similar transition between the Oligocene and Miocene epochs about 23 million years ago. These transitions coincided with a configuration of Earth's orbit around the Sun that facilitated ice growth. Some additional factor on Earth, however, amplified the climate response during these transitions. </p><p>The geological record suggests that this additional factor was a reduction of greenhouse warming due to a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The Southern Ocean may have played a role in the drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide through its influence on the global carbon cycle, Anderson said. </p><p>Her study suggests that, unlike today, the mixing of the Southern Ocean around the time of the climate shift was neither as intense nor as deep as it is now. As a result, the ocean was more stratified and regional characteristics of deep and intermediate waters were maintained. This layered structure may have had important consequences for global carbon cycling, setting the stage for the transition from greenhouse to icehouse.</p><p>Phytoplankton--tiny plants growing in the surface waters--use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and transform it into organic carbon. When the plants (or animals that feed on them) die and decompose, most of the organic carbon is recycled but a small amount is buried within the deep ocean. In a layered ocean, dead organisms can drift into the deeper layers before they decompose, effectively burying the organic carbon in the depths.</p><p>Shifting continents have gradually changed the Southern Ocean over the past 30 million years so that water now whips around Antarctica in a strong current known as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The strength of the current blocks the influx of nutrient-poor surface water and, as this current squeezes through the narrow passage between South America and Antarctica, it mixes the water from top to bottom. As a result, most of the organic carbon formed within the Southern Ocean today is oxidized before it can be buried.</p><p>The impact of organic carbon burial on the atmospheric carbon dioxide depends on the relative burial of organic carbon to total carbon. The types of organisms that fix organic carbon are important, because some form shells of inorganic carbon in a process that releases carbon dioxide. Regional characteristics of the water affect which organisms are favored ecologically by controlling the nutrient content of the surface ocean. The integral relationship between biology (the organisms that fix the organic carbon) and the physical structure of the ocean (both the delivery of nutrients and removal of organic carbon for burial) ultimately control the atmospheric carbon dioxide, Anderson said.</p><p>As scientists search for ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere and reduce global warming, understanding organic carbon burial mechanisms of the past and the role of the structure of the ocean will give us important insights into how the global system may behave in the future, Anderson said. </p><p>"We have a long way to go to understand the modern Earth system, but because we only have one Earth, we must turn to the geological record to provide us with test cases," she said. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Anderson at (831) 459-4789 or linda@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f5f508072704601a012ffdee9ebed"><name>792</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Soil ecologist investigates the role of plant roots in regulating carbon cycling and reducing global warming</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>AGU, rhizosphere</keywords><start-date>1133766000000</start-date><display-name>Soil ecologist investigates the...</display-name><path>/2005/12/792</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/12/792</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338152212</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338152212</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Soil ecologist Weixin Cheng is at the leading edge of scientific efforts to quantify the impacts of plant roots on the cycling of carbon between the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide contributes to global warming, and terrestrial ecosystems, where large amounts of carbon are stored in soil organic matter.</p><p>Cheng, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, studies complex above- and below-ground systems to gather data on the movement of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. He will present his findings this week at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco (session B51E, talk #2, on Friday, December 9, at 8:15 a.m.).</p><p>Plant roots contribute as much as 50 percent of the total carbon dioxide produced by terrestrial ecosystems, and they also play a major role in adding organic carbon to soil. But many studies of soil carbon have measured it in incubated soil samples that lack roots and vegetation. </p><p>"We've been oversimplifying the ecosystem," said Cheng, who has developed new techniques of measuring belowground carbon cycles. </p><p> </p><p>In the greenhouse, Cheng is evaluating numerous plants, including soybeans, corn, wheat, Ponderosa pine, cottonwood, and amaranths.</p><p>By focusing on the rhizosphere, the soil that surrounds the roots of a plant, Cheng has documented changes in the rate of soil organic matter decomposition that vary from 70 percent suppression to 300 percent stimulation, a range that underscores Cheng's assertion that soil processes cannot be understood under plantless conditions. </p><p>Cheng isolates the impacts of different plant species by controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide and using soil samples with varied "signatures" based on carbon-13 isotope levels. The variation in soils allows Cheng to mix-and-match plant-soil combinations in the greenhouse and isolate preexisting soil carbon from carbon produced by plant roots. In addition, he uses a small, specialized videocamera to document belowground root changes over time. </p><p>"These methods generate a whole array of new questions," he said. "How do different plant species differ? Do different soils respond to different plants in different ways? It makes the research much more difficult."</p><p>The answers, however, can be invaluable to land managers developing strategies to store more carbon in the soil to counteract global warming.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Editor's Note:</b> You may contact Cheng at (831) 459-5317 or wxcheng@ucsc.edu.</p><p>More information about Weixin Cheng's work is available on his web site at <a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~wxcheng/">http://people.ucsc.edu/~wxcheng/</a>.

The three will be honored along with 31 student award winners at the Alumni Association Awards Luncheon February 4.</p><p>Students reflecting on courses with teaching award-winner Don Rothman describe him as "amazing," "exceptional," and "bursting with enthusiasm." When asked how the course could be improved, many offered such comments as "It's perfect," "don't change a thing," or "don't retire." In nominating Rothman for the award, former student Alija Mujic (Porter College, 2004) described his exemplary commitment to students. "Frequently, I found myself with Don in discussion both inside and out of class poring over ideas that our reflective writing had brought to mind...he has displayed to me the highest level of commitment to the quality of education offered by UCSC."</p><p>Rothman's 32-year teaching career has been closely connected with UCSC's Oakes College.

Under Scott's leadership, CDC-Tanzania assisted the Tanzanian government to improve its national HIV/AIDS surveillance system, strengthen laboratory services, advance blood-transfusion safety, and develop a network of antenatal health centers that target prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.</p><p>Scott's work in Tanzania was part of a wide-ranging public health and clinical career that has taken her around the world, with experiences in the Ivory Coast, Kenya, India, and the Caribbean.  Scott began her CDC career in 1993 as an investigator in the elite Epidemic Intelligence Service and also has worked in maternal and child health and disaster epidemiology in California, New York, and New Jersey, where she was the state maternal and child health epidemiologist. She has recently returned to the United States and is working as a medical director at CDC headquarters in Atlanta.</p><p>A 1974 Oakes graduate in biology, Scott earned her medical degree from Boston University School of Medicine in 1982 and a master's degree in public health from Johns Hopkins in 1986.  She completed a preventive medicine residency at CDC headquarters in 1995. Scott is published in the areas of reproductive and child health, disaster epidemiology, and HIV surveillance and laboratory strengthening. She is a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and has received several Public Heath Service awards.</p><p>What began as a small support system for "nontraditional" women students-those not fitting the 18- to 22-year-old profile--has blossomed under staff award-winner Corinne Miller's leadership. Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) now welcomes more than 3,000 transfer and nontraditional students and has a solid record for student success. "As a testament to the quality of these programs, a greater proportion of transfer and re-entry students are elected to Phi Beta Kappa than from the general population," wrote Ronaldo Ramirez, director of development in Student Affairs, in nominating Miller for the staff award. Last year, STARS took another program under its wing, becoming the administrative base for the Renaissance Scholars Program and the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, serving foster and homeless youth.</p><p>Miller's leadership and advocacy inspired the UCSC Women's Club, the Soroptimist International, and the American Association of University Women to fund endowed scholarships for STARS students. Another group STARS works closely with, the UCSC Lifelong Learners organization, has developed a UCSC scholarship endowment.</p><p>Miller's skill at finding housing, tutors, and jobs for students is matched by an amazing talent for motivation. "After you spend time with her, you really feel like there is nothing you can't do," said Yvonne W. Rodriguez, a 2001 physics graduate now working on her Ph.D. in physics at UCSC. "Thank goodness she has an open-door policy so that you can stop in anytime you need support."</p><p>In her more than 20 years of helping students, Miller's commitment has gone beyond any job description. "Corinne Miller and her staff created a small haven for those of us who did not fit into the normal college scene," wrote former re-entry student Patricia E. Boyer, who went on to get a master's degree from Harvard after graduating from UCSC.</p><p>The Alumni Awards Luncheon will be held at noon on Saturday, February 4, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. In addition to Rothman, Scott, and Miller, the luncheon will honor student winners of awards funded by the UCSC Alumni Association. RSVPs are required by January 27, and may be made by calling (831) 459-2530, (800) 933-SLUG, or going online (http://alumni.ucsc.edu/). The cost of the luncheon is $18.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f62388072704601a012ffe813552a"><name>794</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astrophysicists detect very high-energy gamma rays from the Milky Way</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Milagro, SCIPP, gamma rays</keywords><start-date>1134630000000</start-date><display-name>Astrophysicists detect very high-energy...</display-name><path>/2005/12/794</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/12/794</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338152971</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338152971</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Scientists using the Milagro Gamma-ray Observatory in New Mexico have captured evidence of radiation emitted from the plane of our home galaxy at extremely high energies. The researchers detected "TeV gamma rays"--electromagnetic radiation in the one trillion electronvolt energy range, about a trillion times more energetic than visible light--and determined that the gamma rays were coming from the Milky Way. </p><p>The TeV gamma rays are thought to be generated when even more energetic cosmic rays plow into clouds of gas in the galaxy. The new findings, published in December 16 issue of the journal <i>Physical Review Letters</i>, finally confirm theoretical predictions after years of efforts to make the necessary experimental measurements.</p><p>"The theoretical expectation was that cosmic rays interacting with material in the galaxy would produce high-energy gamma rays as a result of those collisions. This is the first confirmation of this mechanism at the highest energies," said David Williams, an adjunct professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a coauthor of the paper. </p><p>Milagro, operated by scientists from nine institutions, is the first telescope capable of continuously monitoring the northern sky in the TeV energy range. It records the arrival of the highly energetic photons (particles of radiation) by observing the air shower of secondary particles generated when a gamma ray hits the atmosphere. These particles emit light (Cerenkov radiation) when they pass through water. Milagro consists of a huge pool of water (about the size of a football field and holding 6 million gallons), sealed to keep out light and instrumented with light-sensitive detectors. </p><p>The Milagro experiment has been in operation since 1999. The Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC was one of the founding groups in the collaboration and has played a central role in the design and development of the electronics and other hardware components and in the ongoing operation of the experiment. Seven SCIPP scientists, including Williams, are among the coauthors on the paper describing the new findings. </p><p>The analysis of the data was led by Roman Fleysher and Peter Nemethy of New York University. They culled 70,000 TeV photon events from within a region of the Milky Way plane out of a total inventory of about 240 million TeV-level events seen from the same region so far in the Milagro experiment. </p><p>"This was a very difficult analysis, because the flux of gamma rays is so small compared to the flux of charged cosmic rays, so it has taken a long time to be able to make the measurement," Williams said. </p><p>Previous experiments have detected gamma ray emissions from the galactic plane at energies up to 30 GeV (30 billion electronvolts). This was achieved by the EGRET satellite experiment on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The photons detected by Milagro are on average 100 times more energetic than the highest-energy gamma rays detected by EGRET, Williams said.</p><p>"With its wide field of view and long exposure, Milagro has different capabilities from other experiments used to study high-energy gamma rays," he said. "We are achieving sensitivities never before achieved in this energy range, and we hope to extend these measurements to test even more precisely the scientific models for high-energy cosmic rays in the galaxy."</p><p>In addition to NYU and UCSC, the other institutions involved in the Milagro collaboration are the University of Wisconsin, University of Maryland, Los Alamos National Laboratory, George Mason University, Michigan State University, University of New Hampshire, and UC Irvine.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Williams at (831) 459-3032 or daw@scipp.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27be8668072704601a012ffa346ed84"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/12/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626283575</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626283575</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27be8668072704601a012ffa346ed84"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/12/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/12/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626283575</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626283575</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
