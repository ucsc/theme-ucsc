One place they definitely should not be is atop Mount Hamilton, say police and astronomers at Lick Observatory. Parking at the observatory is very limited and there are no public facilities available for nighttime viewing.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Lick Observatory has limited parking and no public programs for viewing the comet</font></b></td></tr></table>Most experts think it is unlikely that viewers on the ground will see anything without powerful telescopes. The best images of the impact will be available from NASA on the Deep Impact web site: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/main">www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/main</a>. This site will also feature a live webcast of the event's coverage on NASA TV. </p><p>"I will be following it at my computer, enjoying NASA's policy of putting it on the web as soon as possible," said Erik Asphaug, an associate professor of Earth sciences at UCSC and an expert on small planetary bodies such as comets and asteroids.</p><p>Amateur astronomers determined to view the event through their own telescopes will need to be in a dark location away from city lights, but Mount Hamilton offers no particular advantages and some potentially serious disadvantages, said Remington Stone, a research astronomer and director of operations at Lick Observatory.</p><p>The narrow and winding Mt. Hamilton Road (State Highway 130) becomes a safety hazard if too many spectators attempt to drive to the summit. Nighttime traffic jams have occurred on this road during other astronomical events, jeopardizing access for emergency vehicles and endangering pedestrians who have abandoned their cars.</p><p>"The top of Mount Hamilton is a long way to drive only to be turned away, and there is no advantage to being there as opposed to any other dark site," Stone said.</p><p>Furthermore, the lights from cars could interfere with astronomers' efforts to study the comet. Major telescopes around the world, including two of Lick Observatory's telescopes, will be trained on the comet to observe the impact. </p><p>"The comet surface brightness is quite low, and the amount of additional light from the impact could be anything, so we really do not want a lot of extra light on the ground that night," Stone said.</p><p>The impact is scheduled to take place at 10:52 p.m. Pacific Time on the night of Sunday, July 3. The Deep Impact spacecraft will deploy a 39-inch impactor into the path of the comet, which is about half the size of Manhattan Island. By observing the impact crater and how it develops, scientists hope to learn the basic structure and density of the comet.</p><p>"This is the first experiment conducted on any small planetary body--asteroid or comet--and it has the potential to revolutionize what we know," Asphaug said. "I'm one of those who don't think Tempel 1 is a ball of ice. I think the probe is going to hit something very porous, and this should be detectable in how (and whether) the crater forms."</p><p>Lick Observatory is an astronomical research facility operated by the University of California Observatories. Its administrative headquarters are on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The observatory's visitors' center is open to the public from 12:30 to 5 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends.

The Department of Water Resources contributed $909,050 of Proposition 50 funds. The initiative, the "Water Security, Clean Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection Act of 2002" approved by voters in November 2002, included bonds to fund grants for the desalination of ocean or brackish waters.</p><p>"This project is a good example of how we can bring the university's resources to bear on problems of immediate and practical concern to California," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. </p><p>The goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive planning tool that communities, water planning agencies, and water providers can use to assess the costs and benefits of desalination relative to other options in their area. Currently, when communities consider potential desalination projects, they have no framework within which to evaluate the pros and cons, said Haddad. Desalination plants remove salt from ocean water, or brackish inland water, by forcing it through a series of membranes and filters.</p><p>"In some parts of the world, from Saudi Arabia to the island of Majorca, they depend on desalination," said Haddad. "With more than 7,500 plants operating worldwide, it is definitely a proven and reliable technology. But it is expensive, and each municipality has to weigh the environmental and economic costs and benefits."</p><p>Costs have come down over the past decade as technology has become more efficient, but desalination still runs about $500-2,000 per acre foot of water (325,000 gallons), compared to about $250 per acre foot for water in urban Los Angeles, and $10 per acre foot paid to the federal government by farmers in the Sierra foothills, according to Haddad, the author of Rivers of Gold: Designing Markets to Allocate Water in California (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2000).</p><p>"Desalination will matter in the next drought," emphasized Haddad. "That's when people will be willing to pay a lot of money for water, because businesses will be at risk. It will impact local economies, public health, and even fire protection in some areas." </p><p>A moderate to severe drought now would have even greater impacts than the droughts of 1977 and the early 1990s because the state's population and economy have grown so much since then, noted Haddad, an advocate of a "portfolio approach" to water supply management that reduces risk by tapping multiple sources. "Marin County and Santa Barbara County were very hard-hit by those droughts, and they'd be hard-pressed to manage today," he said. "We need a variety of water supplies in California." </p><p>Haddad's comprehensive analysis will link economic aspects of desalination with environmental impacts. Challenges include figuring out how to dispose of leftover salt and how to avoid inadvertently capturing fish in coastal water intakes. However, Haddad identified potential unrecognized environmental benefits of desalination, which could include:</p><p>	. improved fish habitat due to reduced diversions from rivers, streams, and 	groundwater</p><p>	.  energy savings and less air pollution if the amount of water being pumped across 	the state is reduced</p><p> </p><p>	. greater protection of high-quality groundwater due to reduced pumping of aquifers</p><p>	</p><p>The two-year study will examine other potential social and economic benefits and costs, including the value desalination could offer in terms of drought relief and protection of agricultural lands by reducing municipal demands on water that is currently used 	for irrigation. Other factors include the economic impacts of alternative water supply scenarios; the risk-reducing value of a portfolio approach to water supply management; the pros and cons of changing the levels of interdependence between the water supply and power sectors; and the comparative risks of different levels of dependence on technology for water supply.</p><p>Participants will also examine the environmental justice aspects of water, working with advocates and organizations to integrate questions of "who pays for water?" and "who gets the best water?" into the analysis.</p><p>The framework will incorporate "no project" scenarios, as well as water conservation, reclamation, and re-use alternatives. Two case studies will be prepared, one for the Long Beach Water Department and one for the Inland Empire Utilities Agency; both will identify a full range of potential benefits and costs. In addition, participants hope to provide a preliminary analysis of a desalination project in Monterey County.</p><p>The project, entitled "A Comprehensive Economic and Environmental Framework to Fully Assess the Benefits and Costs of Desalination," begins this summer. Other participants include Michael Hanemann, Chancellor's Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics of UC Berkeley; Robert Wilkinson, who teaches environmental science at UC Santa Barbara; the Long Beach Water Department; the Inland Empire Utilities Agency; the Coachella Valley Water District; the San Diego County Water Authority; and the Monterey Coastal Division of the California-American Water Company. Planning and regulatory agencies include the California Regional Water Quality Control Board of San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Nongovernmental organizations include the California League of Conservation Voters, the Surfrider Foundation, the WateReuse Foundation; and Residents of Pico Rivera for Environmental Justice. Also participating will be Robert Raucher and Elizabeth Strange of Stratus Consulting; Edward Means and Dennis Dickenson of McGuire Environmental; and Poseidon Resources, which manufactures desalination equipment.</p><p>---</p><p>Editor's Note: Brent Haddad may be reached at (831) 459-4149 or via email at bhaddad@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914efa978072704601a012ff2eee98aa"><name>718</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Moore Foundation gives UC Santa Cruz a $2.2 million grant for marine microbiology research facility</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, UCSC Institute of Marine Sciences, Jonathan Zehr</keywords><start-date>1121324400000</start-date><display-name>Moore Foundation gives UC...</display-name><path>/2005/07/718</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/07/718</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338126392</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338126392</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a $2.2 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to establish a state-of-the-art facility for marine microbiology research. The new laboratory, operated by UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, will support the work of UCSC researchers as well as their collaborators and visiting scientists from other institutions. </p><p>"Marine microbiology is an exciting new area of ocean investigation, and it's a real honor that the Moore Foundation has chosen UCSC to set up a top laboratory for research in this important field," said Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences and principal investigator on the grant.</p><p>The grant will provide equipment and staff for a "microbial genomics experimentation and remote sensing laboratory," which will be housed in the Earth and Marine Sciences Building on the UCSC campus. Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences, is co-principal investigator and will be a major user of the new facility. The Moore Foundation named Zehr a senior investigator in its marine microbiology initiative last year, supporting his research with a five-year, $4.2 million grant. </p><p>Marine microorganisms are not easy to study because they are small and difficult to isolate and grow in the laboratory. Yet vast numbers of them swarm in every cup of seawater. </p><p>"There are thousands of important microorganisms out there that we've never gotten into a culture flask. So we need to be able to characterize individual cells or characterize the genetic material directly from the ocean without cultivating the organisms, and this new facility will have equipment to help us do that," Zehr said. </p><p>Zehr has made important discoveries about marine microorganisms that "fertilize" the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use, a process known as "nitrogen fixation." He is currently developing genetic probes that can be deployed on moored platforms in the ocean to automatically detect the presence of nitrogen-fixing microbes in the water. This project involves a close collaboration with Chris Scholin, a molecular biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in Moss Landing. </p><p>"The new facility will strengthen our ties with MBARI and support our collaborative work on a project that is really on the cutting edge of marine microbiology," Zehr said. </p><p>Also involved in the project are UCSC oceanographers Raphael Kudela, an associate professor of ocean sciences, and Christopher Edwards, an assistant professor. Kudela and Edwards will use information from the probes and other oceanographic data from remote sensing to try to understand the factors that govern the distribution and large-scale patterns of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in the ocean. Ultimately, they hope to develop computer models that can use information from ocean monitoring and remote sensing to make predictions about the growth patterns of marine microorganisms. </p><p>Although relatively little is known about the ocean's microbial communities, researchers have found that they are enormously important to marine ecology, the availability and transformations of key nutrients, and even the global climate. </p><p>"Marine microorganisms catalyze all the major biochemical transformations on the planet, they help maintain nutrient availability, and they are also a rich source of genetic information, some of which may be useful for biotechnology," Zehr said.</p><p>"There is a lot of interest in marine microbes now, because people have realized that the ocean is a huge untapped resource of genes and microorganisms that we know very little about," he added.</p><p>The equipment in the new facility will include a flow cytometer, a sophisticated tool that uses laser beams to characterize single cells as they pass through at high speeds, processing and sorting thousands of cells in just a few seconds. The facility will also have a laboratory for cultivation and genomics experiments, as well as a powerful bioinformatics computer cluster for performing genetic analyses. </p><p>In addition to Zehr, researchers in environmental toxicology and other departments at UCSC are also expected to make use of the facility, Griggs said.</p><p>"It is a multi-user facility, so it will benefit a lot of people on campus and will also attract visiting scientists to UCSC," Griggs said.</p><p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation was established in November 2000 by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore and his wife Betty to create positive outcomes for future generations. The foundation funds outcome-based grants and initiatives to achieve significant and measurable results. Grant making supports the foundation's principal areas of concern: environmental conservation, science, higher education, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The foundation launched its 10-year marine microbiology initiative in April 2004, with the goal of attaining new knowledge regarding the composition, function, and ecological role of microbial communities in the world's oceans. </p><p>______</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Griggs at (831) 459-5006 or griggs@ucsc.edu and Zehr at (831) 459-4009 or zehrj@emerald.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914efc408072704601a012ff45cda96a"><name>719</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Weeklong astronomy conference honoring UC Santa Cruz professors will feature a public lecture on Tuesday, August 9</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495</author><keywords>George Blumenthal, Sandra Faber, Joel Primack.</keywords><start-date>1121670000000</start-date><display-name>Weeklong astronomy conference honoring...</display-name><path>/2005/07/719</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/07/719</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338126861</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338126861</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>About 200 astronomers, including many of the world's leading astrophysicists and cosmologists, will gather at the University of California, Santa Cruz, next month for a weeklong conference to honor three UCSC professors--astronomers George Blumenthal and Sandra Faber and physicist Joel Primack.</p>
<p>As part of the conference, Primack, a professor of physics, and his wife, Nancy Abrams, will give a public talk entitled "The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos." The talk will be based on their new book by the same title, due to be published in the spring of 2006.</p>
<p>Primack and Abrams, a writer and songwriter, have a special interest in the cultural implications of modern cosmology and have cotaught a course on cosmology and culture at UCSC since 1996. Their presentation will take place from 8 to 10 p.m. on Tuesday, August 9, in Classroom Unit 2 on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the public. For additional information about the public lecture, contact Nancy Moore at (831) 459-5092 or <a href="mailto:&quot;nmoore@ucsc.edu&quot;">nmoore@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The title of the conference, "Nearly Normal Galaxies in a Lambda CDM Universe," refers to the prevailing Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theory of cosmology. Convincing evidence for dark matter, which cannot be seen but can be detected indirectly by observing its gravitational effects, was discovered by astronomers in the late 1970s. About 85 percent of all the matter in the universe is thought to be dark matter, while ordinary matter accounts for the remaining 15 percent. In the 1980s, Blumenthal, Faber, Primack, and others established the important role of slow-moving ("cold") dark matter in the formation, properties, and evolution of galaxies. Their ideas about CDM, though more than 20 years old, remain the dominant working paradigm for structure formation in the universe.</p>
<p>The Greek letter lamda in the title refers to a repulsive force that Albert Einstein added to his 1916 theory of gravity to counteract the attractive force of gravity so as to preserve a static universe. Einstein called lambda his "biggest blunder" after the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered in 1929 that the universe was not static but expanding. Recent observations, however, show that the expansion of the universe is not being slowed by gravity, as expected, but is actually speeding up. This surprising result suggests that Einstein's repulsive force, lambda--now called "dark energy"--may have been right after all.</p>
<p>The conference title also refers back to a landmark conference held at UCSC in 1986 and documented in a book edited by Faber, Nearly Normal Galaxies (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1987). This year's conference is expected to be equally memorable as one of the major conferences of the decade on galaxy formation.</p>
<p>"Progress in cosmology has been truly astronomical since the last conference 19 years ago," said David Koo, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC who is helping to organize this year's conference.</p>
<p>"Using the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck Telescopes finished in the mid-1990s, astronomers can now peer at 'nearly normal' galaxies 8 billion years further back in time than the 4 billion years possible in 1986, to near the beginning of our universe just after the Big Bang," Koo said.</p>
<p>Blumenthal, Faber, and Primack have all made fundamental contributions to the scientific understanding of how galaxies formed and how the universe has evolved over time. The conference in their honor, organized to celebrate their 60th birthdays, will address the recent explosion of observational data in astronomy and explore its theoretical implications. The conference is sponsored by NASA, the National Science Foundation, and Orion Telescopes &amp; Binoculars.</p>
<p>Blumenthal, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, joined the UCSC faculty in 1972. He continues to investigate the origin of structure in the universe, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and the role that dark matter plays in the formation and evolution of this structure. He also studies related cosmological issues, such as the generation of density fluctuations during an early inflationary phase of the universe. In addition to his work in cosmology, Blumenthal has studied gamma-ray bursts, accretion disks, and active galactic nuclei and maintains a strong interest in those areas. He has served as chair of the UC Academic Senate for 2004-05.</p>
<p>Faber, a University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics, also came to UCSC in 1972. She is a leading authority on telescopes and astronomical instrumentation, and is renowned for her work on the role of dark matter in the formation of structure in the universe. Faber and a group of colleagues were the first to detect high-speed flows of galaxies on cosmic scales. She is currently involved in several projects, including a major survey of distant galaxies (the DEEP Survey), studies of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, and the development of adaptive optics systems to sharpen the images of ground-based telescopes. Her many awards and honors include the Bok Prize of Harvard University, the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics, and election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.</p>
<p>Primack has done pioneering research in particle physics and cosmology. His current research in cosmology involves the use of supercomputers to simulate and visualize the evolution of the universe and the formation of galaxies. These computer simulations enable him and his collaborators to compare the predictions of theories with the observational data. Primack is also active in addressing policy issues in science and technology, and he is currently chairman of the American Physical Society Forum on Physics and Society.
