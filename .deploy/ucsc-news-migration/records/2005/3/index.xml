<p>The public is invited to attend an awards ceremony and reception for the artists that will be held Saturday, March 12, at 2 p.m. at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, 100 Shaffer Road, in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 students entered the Marine Masterpieces Student Art Contest &amp; Exhibition, which attracted entries from as far away as Wisconsin. The contest was open to individuals and groups that produced works that "communicate something about marine life/science, ocean conservation, or marine scientists." Individual winners were selected in each of four categories: K-1st grade, 2-3rd grade, 4-6th grade, and 7-12th grade. Winners were also selected from a separate category for group artwork.</p>
<p>"We had a really good response," said contest coordinator Kevin Keedy, who manages youth programs at the Seymour Center. "The artwork is fantastic."</p>
<p>The contest provides an opportunity for marine enthusiasts to express themselves artistically, and it encourages others to study the oceans in order to produce a work of art, said Keedy. "It's a neat way to get kids involved, and the exhibit gives the public an opportunity to see and enjoy the art," he said.</p>
<p>A total of 288 artists produced 236 pieces that were judged by a panel of six judges. First-place winners will receive one-year student memberships to the Seymour Center, while their teachers will receive a voucher for $100 toward a class field trip to the center; other prizes include T-shirts and books. The contest was sponsored by Don and Peggy Schmitz.</p>
<p>The Seymour Marine Discovery Center is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. Part of the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the center offers exhibit halls, aquaria, touch tanks, and public tours overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.</p>

Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) in Great Britain have released the results of a project to identify a core set of genes that can be located in the human genome and have been validated as coding for proteins.</p>
<p>After more than a year of work, the collaboration has released a set of 14,795 genes that can be reliably said to code for a protein. This gene set, called the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) set, was posted today on the three major public human genome browsers: the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl Browser</a> at EBI and WTSI, and the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/">NCBI web site</a>.</p>
<p>The CCDS set is built by consensus among the collaborating members at UCSC, NCBI, EBI, and WTSI. UCSC's involvement in this international collaboration is led by David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p>
<p>"Now that biomedical science has an internationally accepted human genome reference sequence to work from, it's time to identify a corresponding reference set of human genes from that genome," Haussler said.</p>
<p>The CCDS project addresses the fact that the genes listed in human genome databases often are not entirely validated, and the same gene may have different names in different databases. Since the data characterizing the genes come from a variety of sources, researchers are not always certain that a listed gene is real and its stated function is accurate.</p>
<p>The CCDS genes have been given unique identifier and version numbers to help locate them on genome maps. Each of the genome browser sites will receive regular updates as the collaboration continues to refine its knowledge of the protein-coding genes.</p>
<p>Until the Human Genome Project succeeded in sequencing and assembling the entire human genome, researchers could sequence the DNA in a gene, but had no way to accurately determine its location in the genome. Once the genome was sequenced, researchers began to note which parts of the genome contained known genes, a process known as genome annotation.</p>
<p>Haussler's group at UCSC pioneered the use of a mathematical approach known as hidden Markov models as a way to find genes in DNA sequences using automated computer programs. The technique is now widely used for this purpose, but Haussler said the problem of finding all the genes in the DNA sequence of the human genome has proven to be "much more difficult than we ever imagined."</p>
<p>"It will take the coordinated efforts of experimentalists and computational biologists many more years to complete this task," he said.</p>
<p>The CCDS set is calculated following coordinated whole genome annotation updates carried out by NCBI and Ensembl. Annotation updates represent genes that are defined by a mixture of manual curation, carried out by the WTSI Havana team and the NCBI RefSeq group, and automated computational processing performed by groups at Ensembl and NCBI.</p>
<p>"Resolving inconsistencies between gene structures generated by complementary methods of manual curation and automatic annotation is a major step towards providing stable and accurate annotation that can be relied on by researchers," said Tim Hubbard, head of human genome analysis at WTSI.</p>
<p>According to Mark Diekhans, the lead researcher on this project from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group, inconsistencies arise because different centers have used different methods to identify where genes reside. "The names and locations do not always agree, especially in cases where the gene's function isn't well understood," Diekhans said.</p>
<p>As a result, the huge gene databases contain genes that appear to be duplicates or are quite similar, either in their DNA sequences or in their expression in the living organism. Having the entire human genome assembled and viewable with online browsers presents an opportunity for researchers to find each gene sequence in its correct location on the chromosomes and determine, for example, if one gene has been given two different names, or if they are in fact separate genes.</p>
<p>The UCSC contribution to the CCDS project has been mostly quality control, Diekhans said. "We compared the gene sets postulated by NCBI and Sanger to find the intersections between them. Then we applied various bioinformatics approaches to find where the sequences in this intersecting set might not actually be protein-coding," he said.</p>
<p>One approach the UCSC group used was to compare the intersecting set to a list of likely pseudogenes, elements in the DNA sequence that appear to be genes but cannot be transcribed to form proteins. These pseudogenes were predicted by software developed at UCSC by graduate student Robert Baertsch. Sequences that appeared to be pseudogenes were removed from consideration for the CCDS set, and any removed sequence will likely undergo more study before it is finally accepted as a gene or ruled out.</p>
<p>The UCSC team also compared the intersecting set with analogous locations on the genomes of other organisms--chimpanzee, chicken, dog, mouse, rat, and rhesus monkey. These comparisons between species aid in gene validation. "When gene segments are conserved across multiple species, it indicates that they are likely to be real and not pseudogenes," Diekhans said.</p>
<p>The UCSC Genome Browser makes comparative genomics much simpler, because it allows side-by-side comparisons of analogous genome segments from various species.</p>
<p>"Comparing human genes to the genes of related species will be the key to finalizing the human gene set," Haussler said. "All of biology is the result of evolution. Genes cannot be fully apprehended outside of their evolutionary context."</p>
<p>The collaborating groups used a conservative process in establishing the CCDS set. "We were going for high quality and high confidence," Diekhans said. "When in doubt about a gene, we left it out of our set. This makes the CCDS a valuable reference set for disease research."</p>
<p>In addition to Diekhans and Haussler, the UCSC team includes Adam Siepel, Robert Baertsch, Fan Hsu, Chuck Sugnet, and the entire UCSC Genome Browser team, led by Jim Kent. Lead researchers at collaborating institutions include David Lipman, Jim Ostell, and Kim Pruitt at NCBI; Hubbard, Richard Durbin, Steve Searle, and Jennifer Ashurst at WTSI; and Ewan Birney at EBI.</p>
<p>"UCSC is very proud to be playing a role in this collaboration with such outstanding collaborators as NCBI, EBI, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute," Haussler said.</p>

Its presence is so unusual and persistent, and its blooms so dense, we suspect it is signaling a change in our coastal waters," said Mary Silver, professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. </p><p>While Silver and other scientists around Monterey Bay are keeping a close eye on the situation, they noted that federal funding for the programs that support this kind of monitoring effort is increasingly uncertain.</p><p>The alga has been tentatively identified as Cochlodinium catenatum, a species that has caused fish kills and other damage in the coastal Pacific waters of Mexico and Central America. A closely related species, C. polykrikoides, has killed fish in salmon farms in Vancouver, British Columbia, and has caused severe damage to fish farms in the coastal waters of Korea, China, and Japan.</p><p>Silver's lab has been monitoring Cochlodinium in Monterey Bay since first noticing it in July 2004. The researchers measured concentrations of the algae as high as 50,000 cells per liter in water samples taken last summer. Where dense blooms of the algae occurred, the waters were "slimy" and foul-smelling. Although toxicologists have not isolated a specific toxin from C. catenatum, the slime it produces has been associated with the deaths of fish and corals in Pacific waters of Panama and Costa Rica, where blooms occurred in the 1980s, Silver said. Records from the 1960s and 1970s indicate that blooms of this organism were also noted in the San Diego area, she said.</p><p>Gregg Langlois, who oversees the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) marine biotoxin monitoring program, said C. catenatum was first identified on the Central Coast in 1997 when it bloomed near San Luis Obispo. The recent findings in Monterey Bay were confirmed by Chris Scholin, an expert on toxic algae at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and scientists at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. </p><p>As part of Silver's monitoring efforts, carried out in conjunction with Langlois's statewide program, bags of mussels are hung in the water below the Santa Cruz Wharf and checked every week to monitor for toxicity. The mussels began to die when C. catenatum showed up, and continued dying for about five months, Silver said.</p><p>"Up until about a month ago we were still getting dead mussels," she said. "The algae produces some substance that is nasty, but it is likely to take a while for scientists to nail down exactly what that is."</p><p>Langlois said there is no evidence of any human health effects associated with Cochlodinium blooms. Analyses of tissue samples from affected mussels have not indicated the presence of any known algal toxins, he said. </p><p>"We're not certain what the mechanism is for the deaths of mussels, but there is no evidence that these algae produce a toxin that affects mammals or birds," Langlois said. </p><p>Kenneth Coale, director of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, said the Cochlodinium bloom provides a good illustration of the need for coordinated efforts to monitor ocean conditions along the coast. </p><p>"Without coastal observatories, we might have missed this until we had a major fish kill or other type of ecological damage," Coale said. "What is striking to me is that these blooms may signal coastal climate change, invasion of new species, or both. We need long-term measurements in order to understand what factors contribute to these blooms, whether they are natural or the result of human activity, and what might be done about them."</p><p>Silver's monitoring work is supported by UCSC's Center for Integrated Marine Technologies (CIMT), funded through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of the agency's Coastal Ocean Technology System (COTS). But funding for CIMT, an interdisciplinary effort involving five partner institutions around Monterey Bay, has not been renewed for next year.</p><p>"The marine science institutions all around Monterey Bay are working together to organize an integrated ocean observing system for the Central Coast, and we are trying to move forward in a very uncertain funding climate," said Donald Croll, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and codirector of CIMT. </p><p>Moss Landing's Coale is involved in CIMT and also oversees a related NOAA-funded program, the Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research, and Education (CICORE). CIMT and CICORE are developing complementary ocean monitoring technologies as part of NOAA's efforts to establish a Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). Establishing an integrated ocean observing system is among the key recommendations of a major report issued last year by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, but funding to implement the commission's recommendations has not yet been authorized. </p><p>According to Croll, the need to implement the commission's recommendations on ocean policy will only become more urgent with increasing coastal development and growing human impacts on coastal waters.</p><p>"With a harmful algal bloom, you can't see how it develops over time unless you're out there sampling all the time," Croll said. "Because of the coordinated efforts of marine scientists around Monterey Bay, this is probably one of the most closely observed ocean ecosystems anywhere, and we want to see that continue." </p><p>Silver will be discussing her research on harmful algal blooms in a public lecture at UCSC on Thursday, March 10.

Now in its seventh year, the event has become a thriving institution featuring frequent guest speakers from Europe and diverse contributions from around the world. This year's roundtable takes place on March 11-13 at Barnard College of Columbia University.</p><p>"It was like a field of dreams-we built it and people came," said Roth, newly hired this past fall as the chair of the UC Santa Cruz Philosophy Department. "It has had the desired effect of creating a new center of discussion for this particular area. We put out a call for papers, but we don't select the topic. So we learn what it is that people are collectively writing and thinking about."</p><p>Roth noted that the philosophy of social science has always been considered a subarea of the philosophy of science. But he stressed the importance of taking an interdisciplinary approach to the study of both science and philosophy. </p><p>"The theoretical flow used to be exclusively from the natural sciences to the social sciences," Roth observed. "But ideas that originated in the social sciences such as game theory (mathematical ways of modeling human decision making) are now being used in the biological sciences in such areas as the study of evolutionary change." </p><p>Roth added that recent revelations-such as that research studies of heart patients do not reflect the different effects of drugs and treatment on women-also refute the myth that the natural world is viewed with an unbiased eye by scientists.</p><p>"Scientists, like any other human beings, can wear cultural blinders and this can influence how they do their research," Roth explained. "Scientists might be developing skewed results by not taking into account sex biases that they are unaware of and never thought to look for. We can help make natural scientists aware of what those cultural blinders might be."</p><p>"This is all grist for the philosopher," Roth added. "Because the philosopher's perennial question is: 'Why is science successful?' A stock answer is because it uses the scientific method. But I'm saying that method needs to be constantly examined."</p><p>Roth said that there does not appear to be a single scientific method but instead different techniques and theories that work in different fields of science. </p><p>"I am skeptical that one could come up with a generic formulation of the scientific method," said Roth. "Is there a reasonable extrapolation that one size fits all?  When you find out what goes on in the various fields of science, you find that each has a different way of proceeding. In my view, we want to have a rich understanding of what research is-the pitfalls, the complexities, and all the connecting research agendas and resource limitations-and still get the powerful results. So I see us involved in understanding, and to possibly facilitate, the work of science."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e94558072704601a012ff3f244938"><name>649</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Presents Pacific Rim Music Festival featuring artists from 12 countries in nine concerts:  April 29 to May 7</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1110524400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Presents...</display-name><path>/2005/03/649</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/649</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338100254</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338100254</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Thirty composers, 15 ensembles, and over 100 performers will be featured in the 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival--a nine-day international celebration that will be presented by the UC Santa Cruz Music Department from April 29 to May 7. </p><p>Highlights of the festival include a celebration of composer Terry Riley's 70th birthday featuring the Kronos Quartet and tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium; an evening with the Berkeley Symphony conducted by internationally renowned conductor (and UCSC alumnus) Kent Nagano at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall; and guest performances by Japan's celebrated pianist Aki Takahashi. </p><p>Festivities will kick off on the afternoon of April 29 with a parade and outdoor performance in downtown Santa Cruz by the Korean Folk Percussion Ensemble (Samulnori), a group of 20 performers from Korea. The ensemble will be met at the UCSC campus by percussion ensembles from UC Berkeley and Stanford as the procession makes its way to the university's arts complex. </p><p>	</p><p>"It will be a really grand opening," noted Hi Kyung Kim, UCSC professor of music and artistic director of the festival. "When all three groups reach the Music Center Plaza on campus, they will be joined by the UCSC Gamelan Ensembles."</p><p>Later that evening, San Francisco's Ensemble Parallele will be joined by guest mezzo-soprano Mutsumi Hatano, pipa (lute) virtuoso Wu Man, and violinist Young-Nam Kim for an opening concert titled Hun Qiao (Bridge of Souls) Remembrance, Reconciliation and Peace-a program created in response to modern wartime atrocities. </p><p>"It's a very meaningful project featuring guest artists coming from Korea, China, and Japan," said Kim. "We are trying to pass the spirit of reconciliation and peace to all the countries of the Pacific Rim."	</p><p>Kim added that the festival will also include performances by New York's acclaimed contemporary music ensemble, Speculum Musicae ("the most famous New Music ensemble in the United States"); Germany's EarPort ensemble; and the New Asia String Quartet during the nine-day event.</p><p>The Korean Musical Ceremony on May 6--a collaborative multimedia concert focusing on both the traditional and new music of Korea--will include Kim's own composition Rituel III. This concert features some of Korea's major performing artists such as dancer/choreographer Aeju Lee (honored as one of Korea's National Intangible Treasures), daegeum (bamboo flute) master Jeong Seung Kim, and gayageum (zither) master Byung Ki Hwang. </p><p>"That particular performance will also be on tour to Disney Hall in Los Angeles on May 11 and will be the opening event of the San Francisco International Arts Festival on May 18 at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater," Kim noted. </p><p>The 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival will close on May 7 with Kent Nagano conducting the Berkeley Symphony in a sneak preview of the world premiere of Manzanar: An American Story. The piece is named for one of the 10 Japanese American internment camps during World War II and reflects upon freedom and civil liberty in America. The Santa Cruz preview will also feature the UCSC Concert Choir and be narrated.</p><p>In addition to music and dance, the festival will include four different symposia, including a topic on Japanese musical development, as well as eight special lectures by visiting composers that are all free and open to the public. Kim said that students are planning to attend these sessions from Australia and Korea, as well as from a variety of different UC campuses. </p><p>"We are very excited about promoting international collaborations between new and traditional cultures through this festival," Kim noted. "Our ultimate goal is to establish a Pacific Rim Cultural Center and Korean Music Center at UC Santa Cruz."</p><p>_____</p><p>Tickets for the 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival go on sale March 15.

Researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, measured silver concentrations 50 times greater than the natural background level. Though still well below levels that would be toxic to marine life, this contamination of what had been considered relatively pristine waters highlights the increasingly global impact of industrial emissions from Asia, the researchers said. </p><p>"The most likely source of the silver contamination is atmospheric emissions from coal burning in Asia," said Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology at UCSC. "Silver concentrations in the North Pacific trace the atmospheric depositions of industrial aerosols from Asia, with the highest concentrations in those waters closest to the Asian mainland."</p><p>Mara Ranville, a researcher in Flegal's lab who earned her Ph.D. in December, collected the samples on a 35-day cruise in the summer of 2002 as part of the Global Investigation of Pollution in the Marine Environment (GIPME), a program of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Ranville and Flegal reported their findings in the March 9 issue of Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, an electronic journal published by the American Geophysical Union and the Geochemical Society.</p><p>Ranville found silver concentrations as high as 1.2 parts per trillion in samples of North Pacific surface waters taken during the cruise. This is about 50 times higher than baseline levels of silver in uncontaminated waters sampled by UCSC researchers on a previous cruise in the Atlantic Ocean. Because the natural background level is so low, scientists may be able to use silver as a tracer element for tracking the fate of industrial emissions from Asia, Ranville said.</p><p>"Atmospheric pollution from Asia is becoming a serious problem for the western United States, and this may be a valuable tool for tracing those emissions, both in the atmosphere and in the water," she said. </p><p>Prevailing westerly winds carry atmospheric pollution across the North Pacific ocean from China, where coal is the primary fuel and the use of emissions controls is limited. Major pollutants from the burning of coal are nitrogen and sulfur compounds that contribute to acid rain and smog. Previous studies by Flegal's group have also found high mercury levels in rainfall on the U.S. West Coast, which they linked to contamination from coal burning in Asia. </p><p>"Unlike mercury, silver is not a human health concern. But silver is second only to mercury in its toxicity to marine invertebrates," Flegal said. </p><p>Sam Luoma, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist who has worked with Flegal to study heavy metal contamination in San Francisco Bay, said the elevated silver concentrations in the open ocean suggest there may be "hotspots" in Asian coastal waters where the concentrations reach toxic levels.</p><p>"The open ocean is vastly diluted, so there may be some massive hotspots of silver contamination around the Asian continent. That's where effects on marine organisms would occur," Luoma said.</p><p>In San Francisco Bay, silver and copper from industrial discharges reached such high levels in the 1970s and early 1980s that clams stopped reproducing and some species of invertebrates disappeared from mudflats, he said. At that time, silver concentrations in the bay were 100 times higher than the levels Ranville and Flegal found in the open ocean. With stricter pollution controls, however, silver has now declined to around 6 parts per trillion in bay waters, and the affected invertebrates have recovered, Luoma said.</p><p>The North Pacific survey completes a preliminary survey of silver throughout the world's oceans. The goal was to establish current levels of contamination as a baseline for future studies, Flegal said.</p><p>"We found by far the highest levels of silver in the North Pacific. Even though the Atlantic Ocean is subject to industrial emissions from North America and Europe, the amounts are small compared to what goes into the Pacific from Asia," he said.</p><p>_____</p><p></p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Ranville at (831) 459-5336 or ranville@etox.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e970b8072704601a012ff44c730fe"><name>651</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor photographer Frans Lanting with Global Oceans Award</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1110783600000</start-date><display-name>Friends of Long Marine...</display-name><path>/2005/03/651</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/651</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338100951</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338100951</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Friends of Long Marine Lab will present a Global Oceans Award to renowned nature photographer and conservationist Frans Lanting at the group's annual Gourmet Dinner benefit event on Sunday, March 20.

The Global Oceans Awards were established in 2004 to recognize outstanding individuals who are making a difference for the world's oceans.</p><p>UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton will be a special guest at the Gourmet Dinner, which raises funds for the education programs at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. The dinner, held this year at the Bittersweet Bistro in Rio Del Mar, has long been one of the most popular fundraising events for the Friends of Long Marine Lab. The event will be hosted this year by the proprietors of the Bittersweet Bistro, chef Thomas Vinolus and his wife Elizabeth. </p><p>Lanting, a photographer-in-residence at National Geographic magazine, has been hailed as one of the great nature photographers of our time. He portrays wild creatures as ambassadors for the preservation of complete ecosystems, and his many publications have increased worldwide awareness of endangered ecological treasures in the far corners of the Earth. Lanting serves on the National Council of the World Wildlife Fund and is a UCSC Foundation trustee. </p><p>Olivia Cheriton and Itchung Cheung, both graduate students in ocean sciences, will also receive awards at the dinner. They had the top-ranked proposals among the 19 students who received research support from the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards this year. These awards provided more than $11,000 in total funding for undergraduate and graduate student research projects in the marine sciences. </p><p>Cheriton is studying the dynamics of thin layers of ocean water in Monterey Bay that are associated with the periodic upwelling of cold, deep water and subsequent "relaxation" events. These oceanographic conditions play a significant role in the life cycles of various species of rockfish. Cheriton is working with Margaret McManus, who was an assistant professor of ocean sciences at UCSC and is now at the University of Hawaii. </p><p>Cheung, who works with professor of ocean sciences Mary Silver, is studying harmful algal blooms. In particular, he is investigating possible marine toxin contamination in dungeness and rock crabs in Monterey Bay.</p><p>For information about the Global Oceans Gourmet Dinner and Awards Gala, contact Lisa M.

Denton announced Wednesday at the March meeting of the UC Regents in Los Angeles.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><font color="#333333"><a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/download/regents_03-16-05.html">Listen to Chancellor Denton's presentation to the Board of Regents and view her PowerPoint presentation</a>.</font></td></tr></table>As of March 14, Denton said, the campus had raised $55 million for the Cornerstone Campaign, which continues through June.</p><p>	"This unprecedented level of support for UC Santa Cruz is a tribute to the reputation of our faculty and to the achievements of our students, staff, and alumni," Denton told the Regents. "With state funds supplying only about a third of the UC Santa Cruz budget, this generous support is critical."</p><p>	Formally announced in November 2004 at the UCSC Scholarships Benefit Dinner, the Cornerstone Campaign got an immediate boost when the dinner raised $1 million-double the amount from the previous year's event-for student scholarships and fellowships.</p><p>	The ambitious Cornerstone Campaign will benefit all aspects of UC Santa Cruz, with a special emphasis on undergraduate and graduate student support. Availability of financial aid is a decisive factor in college choice, and an increasing number of UCSC students need financial assistance. In 2003-04, UCSC provided financial support for nearly 8,000 undergraduates.</p><p>	"Every gift makes a difference, and we are grateful to every one of our donors for their vote of confidence in the unique experience that is UC Santa Cruz," said Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations.</p><p>	Fundraising support for UC Santa Cruz has been climbing steadily in recent years, with the campus raising a record $32.2 million in private support in 2003-04. That total included $2.4 </p><p>million for student support, a 174 percent increase over the previous fiscal year.</p><p>	</p><p>Gordon Ringold, chairman and CEO of SurroMed and contributor of the largest outright gift from a UC Santa Cruz alumnus, chairs the Cornerstone Campaign Council.</p><p>	"The success of this initiative represents a milestone for the campus, and is especially heartening as UC Santa Cruz celebrates its 40th anniversary," he said. "Alumni, students, faculty, and staff worked together to accomplish this goal, and I expect even greater achievements in the next decade."</p><p>	The campaign's largest gift was $17.5 million from the Moore Foundation to UCO/Lick Observatory, which is directing the UC initiative on phase two of a project to build the world's most powerful telescope. The Moore Foundation also gave $4 million to support ocean research.</p><p>	UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee and alumna Kit Mura-smith contributed the largest single donation ever given by one of the alumni. She has designated an irrevocable charitable trust to be equally split between enhancing the university's library facilities and providing scholarships for re-entry students.</p><p>	Among other notable gifts, the campus received a $6.5 million real estate gift from Texas Instruments as part of the purchase of facilities at 2300 Delaware Street, Santa Cruz. The property was formerly occupied by Texas Instruments as a fabrication plant.</p><p>	Funding for engineering scholarships also increased dramatically with the gift of $1 million from the Barbara Snader estate for engineering scholarships for women.</p><p>	The success of this Cornerstone Campaign lays the foundation for aggressive planning of a comprehensive fundraising campaign. In her remarks to the UC Regents, Chancellor Denton emphasized that "the power of private philanthropy generates more than funds-it supports innovation, unites the campus community, and transforms lives."</p><p>For more information about private fundraising at UC Santa Cruz, please contact University Relations, (831) 459-2501, or go to giveto.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e9a058072704601a012ffa2ad7280"><name>653</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>National Public Radio science correspondent Richard Harris to speak at UCSC on Wednesday, April 6</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Richard Harris, National Public Radio</keywords><start-date>1111388400000</start-date><display-name>National Public Radio science...</display-name><path>/2005/03/653</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/653</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338101681</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338101681</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Award-winning journalist Richard Harris, science correspondent for National Public Radio, will speak at UC Santa Cruz on Wednesday, April 6, as part of a distinguished lecturer series. Harris, a UCSC alumnus, will give a talk entitled "Telling Tales Out of School: How One Reporter Cracks the World of Science." The event, which is free and open to the public, will begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Stevenson Event Center on the UCSC campus. </p><p>Harris, who joined NPR in 1986, reports on science issues for the NPR programs <I>Morning Edition</I>, <I>All Things Considered</I>, and <I>Weekend Edition</I>. He has traveled throughout the world to report on stories, including trips to Antarctica, the Galapagos Islands, Beijing during the SARS epidemic, the center of Greenland, and the Amazon rain forest. He has earned numerous awards for his reporting and was elected an honorary member of the scientific research society Sigma Xi in 2002. </p><p>Harris will spend three days at UCSC as part of the Cowell College Distinguished Visiting Professor program, funded by a UCSC Alumni Association endowment that supports visiting professors at each of the campus's colleges on a rotating basis. The Cowell College program, focusing on public communication about issues relating to science and technology, includes four public lectures in 2005 and 2006. Harris will meet with a broad range of faculty and students during his visit, including the current class of students in UCSC's Science Communication Program. He will also visit the studios of local public radio station KUSP. </p><p>A California native, Harris was valedictorian of his Crown College graduating class at UCSC in 1980. He earned a B.A. in biology, with highest honors, and went straight into journalism, working as a newspaper reporter before joining NPR. Harris had the instincts of a good reporter even as a student, said John Wilkes, who taught a science writing course Harris took. Wilkes, now director of the Science Communication Program, recalled that when a major wildfire erupted on the Big Sur coast, Harris jumped in his car and drove down to get interviews. </p><p>"He talked to everyone--firefighters, forestry officials, residents--and he got all sides of the story, from the people who said it was a natural event that wouldn't hurt anything to those who said it was devastating," Wilkes said. "When we published his story in our <I>Science Notes</I> magazine, we got more letters on that story than we'd ever gotten. There were complaints from both sides about the story's balance, but the letters came in from both sides in equal numbers."</p><p>Among the many awards Harris has received during his career as a journalist are the Sagan Award for improving the public understanding of science from the Council of Scientific Society Presidents and the Walter C. Alvarez Memorial Award from the American Medical Writers Association, both awarded in 1999. In 1995, he earned the Science Journalism Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his coverage of endocrine disrupters.</p><p>Also in 1995, Harris shared a Peabody Award for investigative reporting about the tobacco industry. He also won the 1994 Aviation/Space Writers Association Gold Award for his coverage of the first Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. He received the 1994 Cindy Award from the Association of Visual Communicators for a story on the ecological impact of non-native species coming to North America.</p><p>Harris is cofounder of the Washington, D.C., Area Science Writers Association and past president of the National Association of Science Writers. </p><p>Harris's public lecture is sponsored by Cowell College and the Alumni Association, with additional support from KUSP.

The U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences (IES) selected Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., to carry out the $10.3 million, five-year evaluation study. The study will examine the effects of two programs, the NTC Induction Model and ETS PATHWISE.</p><p>The New Teacher Center (NTC) has supported beginning teachers since 1988, and now works across the country with school districts interested in intensive induction models. In response to the national policy emphasis on teacher quality, most school districts provide support for new teachers. However, program quality varies, and there is little research to guide districts in improving their efforts. This timely and important IES study will inform districts in making decisions on how best to allocate professional development dollars. </p><p>"We know that teacher quality is the single most important variable in student performance, and we also know that the first two years of teaching are the most challenging," says NTC executive director Ellen Moir. "Our NTC induction model has been shown to cut new teacher dropout rates by half, and we are beginning to show significant impact on student learning. Participating in the IES study is an opportunity to validate our results and increase our understanding of induction efforts."</p><p>The NTC induction model pairs beginning teachers with carefully selected and highly trained experienced teachers released full-time from their classroom duties. Without the split demands of classroom teaching and after-school mentoring, these veteran teachers become skillful "teachers of teachers" who work weekly with novices in their classrooms. Mentors receive ongoing professional development along with a set of mentoring tools and protocols that focus their work with beginning teachers on student learning and classroom practice. The mentors carefully assess the novices' professional needs and then tailor their work accordingly, using the NTC induction materials.</p><p>The IES study will select 20 urban school districts to participate. Ten sites will be assigned to implement the NTC induction model, and 10 sites will implement ETS PATHWISE. Two veteran teachers will be selected in each district to work full-time with first-year teachers at 10 elementary school sites, while a control group of beginning teachers will receive support through the district's preexisting induction program. NTC project director Jan Miles will lead a team of NTC outreach coordinators to provide professional development for the mentors and to work onsite in the 10 districts to guide implementation through June 2006. Mathematica researchers will track the effectiveness of each program on teacher retention, classroom practice, and student achievement. </p><p>"The NTC is committed to ensuring that all new teachers enter schools with the support they need and deserve," noted NTC associate director Janet Gless. "This work is critical, not just to retain new teachers, but to develop outstanding teachers and help our schools become learning communities where students and teachers, alike, are successful."</p><p> </p><p>ABOUT THE NTC</p><p>The New Teacher Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was inaugurated in 1998 as a national resource for teacher induction. NTC's mission is to support the development of dedicated and highly qualified teachers and administrators. NTC works with school districts, universities,  policy makers, and educational leaders to create support systems for new teachers and principals throughout the United States. The NTC builds upon the highly successful work of the Santa Cruz New Teacher Project, an intensive, mentor-based induction model created in 1988 and currently serving beginning teachers in more than 25 school districts in the greater Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz regions. The NTC's 65 staff members work in the areas of policy, research, and practice in more than 30 states. Services include consultation, professional development, research, program evaluation, and product development. </p><p>______</p><p><I>Editor's Note: Ellen Moir may be reached at the New Teacher Center at (831) 459-4323 or via e-mail at moir@ucsc.edu.</I></p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e9cb08072704601a012ff341e4f5f"><name>655</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC engineering dean Steve Kang appointed to blue ribbon panel on nanotechnology</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Steve Kang, nanotechnology, National Science Foundation </keywords><start-date>1110956400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC engineering dean Steve...</display-name><path>/2005/03/655</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/655</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338102398</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338102398</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Steve Kang, dean of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been appointed to the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology (BRTFN), a joint federal-state venture to benefit Silicon Valley and promote California as the premier center for nanotechnology research, development, and commercialization.</p><p>The BRTFN is cochaired by U.S. Representative Mike Honda of San Jose and California State Controller Steve Westly. Members of the task force include nanotechnology experts with backgrounds in industry, academia, government, medical research, and venture capital.</p><p>"BRTFN members will have the opportunity to influence the regional development of nanotechnology, helping usher in a revolutionary new era in technology that will attract investment from governments and businesses around the world," Honda said. "Working in conjunction with the NASA Ames Research Center, Controller Westly and I have the highest expectations for the potential of this endeavor."</p><p>UC Santa Cruz, with its close ties to NASA Ames through the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), is in a strong strategic position to help develop the nanotechnology industry, Kang said.</p><p>"This appointment provides a great opportunity to contribute to the creation of new industry for Silicon Valley and California," Kang said. "Nanotechnology is a critical enabling technology with a broad spectrum of applications and will surely need a strong home base in California, in particular in the greater Silicon Valley region."</p><p>Nanotechnology has the potential to yield revolutionary new materials and processes by enabling scientists and engineers to control how things are made on the atomic and molecular scales. The National Science Foundation predicts the worldwide market for nanotechnology products and services to reach $1 trillion by 2015.</p><p>"Nanotechnology sounds like something out of <I>Star Trek</I>, but it's already being used in cars, tennis rackets, and stain-proof pants," Westly said. "To stay at the center of innovation, California needs to be the worldwide headquarters for nanotechnology. We're asking this group to think big about the future of small technology."</p><p>The BRTFN will document its work in a series of white papers that analyze the direction and state of nanotechnology, followed by specific recommendations aimed at promoting Silicon Valley and California as the national and worldwide center of nanotechnology research, development, and commercialization. Congressman Honda said he will sponsor federal legislation necessary to advance BRTFN recommendations, while Controller Westly will coordinate state-level efforts.</p><p>"The BRTFN has the potential to generate new state revenues from a multitude of job opportunities," Honda noted. "The patents, royalties, and other economic effects of this industry could benefit the state budget for decades to come."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e9e1e8072704601a012ff54a2ade4"><name>656</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz to offer computer game design as a new track for computer science students</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Computer games, Jack Baskin School of Engineering, Ira Pohl</keywords><start-date>1111474800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz to...</display-name><path>/2005/03/656</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/656</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338102742</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338102742</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The development of interactive computer video games has become a multi-billion-dollar industry that caters to the legions of gaming enthusiasts with a steady output of new games featuring ever greater levels of technical sophistication. For students whose interest in games goes beyond merely playing them, the University of California, Santa Cruz, now offers the opportunity to specialize in computer game design through a new track in the computer science major. </p><p>The Computer Science Department in UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering has put together a series of courses that will give students an in-depth introduction to the design and technology of interactive computer video games.</p><p>"The students we've talked to are very excited about it. To my knowledge, this is the first undergraduate initiative in computer gaming in the UC system," said Ira Pohl, professor and chair of computer science. "There are a few places nationally that have similar programs, but it is still a new area." </p><p>Through a combination of new and existing courses, the computer gaming track will give students a strong grounding in key areas such as computer graphics and animation, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. Students will also be able to undertake a major game design project. </p><p>From a technical standpoint, today's video games present extraordinarily difficult design challenges, said Darrell Long, professor of computer science and associate dean for research and graduate studies in the engineering school. </p><p>"There is a lot of hard science involved in creating the virtual worlds that people enter when they play these games. You also have to think about things like story lines and the look and flow of the game," Long said. "My hope is that eventually we will have a separate major in computer game design that will include not only computer science courses but also courses from the Arts Division and other parts of campus."</p><p>UCSC's Arts Division already has a multidisciplinary graduate program in digital arts and new media that brings together faculty from engineering, arts, and other divisions on campus. A full major in computer game design would probably take a similar multidisciplinary approach to address both the technical and creative aspects of game design, Long said. For now, the gaming track in the computer science major focuses primarily on the technical aspects.</p><p>The economic and cultural significance of computer games is undeniable. A recent analysis of the U.S. market for computer and video game software by the NPD Group reported that eight games were sold every second of 2004, for total sales of $7.3 billion. Some estimates have put the global market at greater than $25 billion per year. </p><p>"The economic impact is huge. Computer games are bigger than Hollywood movies now, and we want to help ensure that the state of California remains a leader in this field," Long said. </p><p>#####</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Pohl at (831) 459-3648 or pohl@cs.ucsc.edu and Long at (831) 459-2616 or darrell@cs.ucsc.edu.</p><p>This release is available electronically at the following web site: http://press.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e9fc88072704601a012ffacf5e2d5"><name>657</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study shows introduced foxes transformed vegetation on Aleutian Islands from lush grassland to tundra</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Donald Croll, James Estes, John Maron, ecology and evolutionary biology, Aleutian archipelago </keywords><start-date>1111647600000</start-date><display-name>Study shows introduced foxes...</display-name><path>/2005/03/657</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/657</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338103166</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338103166</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Huge colonies of seabirds accustomed to nesting on islands free of predators began disappearing when fur traders started introducing foxes onto islands in the Aleutian archipelago in the 18th century. The ground-nesting birds made easy meals for the foxes. A study published this week in the journal <I>Science</I> now shows that the effects of the introduced foxes rippled through entire island ecosystems, transforming the vegetation from lush grasslands to scrubby, low-growing tundra. </p><p>It turns out that the nutrient-poor volcanic soils of the Aleutian archipelago can only support dense grasslands if they receive regular doses of fertilizer in the form of bird droppings. On islands without foxes, seabirds transfer nutrients from the ocean to the land by feeding on marine fish and invertebrates and spreading nutrient-rich guano around the islands. Add foxes, and the indirect effects on the whole ecosystem are as dramatic as the direct effects on the seabirds. </p><p>"Introduced species are a global phenomenon, and we tend to focus on the direct effects, such as the reduction or extinction of species that are consumed by an introduced predator. This study shows how the effects of introduced species can spread throughout an ecosystem in unpredictable ways," said Donald Croll, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and first author of the <I>Science</I> paper. </p><p>Efforts by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove introduced foxes from the Aleutian islands have been largely successful. Seabirds are beginning to make a comeback on islands previously colonized by foxes, and in some places the vegetation has begun to look lusher. But it is likely to take decades for the ecosystems to fully recover from the effects of the foxes, said James Estes, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a coauthor of the paper.</p><p>"Most seabirds only have a single offspring each year, so their capacity for population increase is quite low. The foxes are mostly off the islands now, but we will probably continue to see the effects for a long time," Estes said.</p><p>In addition to Croll and Estes, the authors of the <I>Science</I> paper include UCSC graduate student Eric Danner, University of Montana plant ecologist John Maron, and USFWS biologist Vernon Byrd. The study grew out of conversations between Estes, who has been doing research in Alaskan coastal waters for decades, and Byrd, the supervisory biologist for the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. While working to save the endangered Aleutian Canada goose, which the foxes were driving toward extinction, Byrd had noticed the differences between islands with and without foxes and speculated that nutrients might play a role. </p><p>"He had these interesting ideas about foxes and birds and nutrient chains, and I thought we should do some studies to see how robust the idea is," Estes said. </p><p>The team of researchers, accompanied by a small army of student assistants, conducted extensive surveys on the islands for several weeks each summer over three years. They surveyed dozens of islands from one end of the archipelago to the other. Estes said the differences were striking between fox-free islands and fox-infested islands (defined as those where self-sustaining populations of foxes persisted into the late 1990s). </p><p>"When you go to an island that had foxes, it's very easy to walk around because the plants don't grow much higher than your ankles. But on the other islands, it's hard work just to get through the vegetation. It was exhausting just trying to get around on those islands," he said.</p><p>The researchers found that the density of breeding seabirds on fox-free islands was two orders of magnitude higher than on fox-infested islands. The resulting difference in nutrient inputs was reflected in soil phosphorus levels that were more than three times higher on fox-free islands. The vegetation on the islands also showed significant differences in nutrient content. </p><p>Evidence that more ocean-derived nutrients were cycling through the ecosystems of fox-free islands than on fox-infested islands came from analyses of nitrogen isotopes in soil, plant, and animal samples. </p><p>"The terrestrial ecosystem was being subsidized by marine-derived nutrients, and the foxes basically cut off the subsidies by interrupting the flow of nutrients coming from offshore," Croll said. "It transformed the plant community from one that does well in nutrient-rich conditions to one that does well in nutrient-depleted conditions."</p><p>Foxes were first introduced to some of the islands by Russian fur traders in the mid- to late-18th century as a way to supplement the declining harvest of sea otter pelts. But the practice escalated between the 1890s and the 1930s, when the U.S. government worked to establish fox farming businesses on the islands. Mostly arctic foxes and smaller numbers of red foxes were introduced to more than 400 islands. </p><p>Byrd, who has been involved in restoration efforts in the Aleutian islands since 1971, said most of the islands had major breeding colonies of seabirds before the arrival of foxes. There are about 26 species of seabirds that regularly nest on the islands, he said. They include surface nesters, such as gulls and terns, that lay their eggs on the ground; burrow nesters, such as puffins, that dig burrows in the soil for their nests; and crevice nesters, such as auklets, that nest in boulder piles and rock crevices.</p><p>According to Byrd, surface nesters and burrow nesters tended to disappear completely from islands with foxes, while populations of crevice nesters were reduced but not eliminated. Ledge nesters such as murres and kittiwakes, which nest on steep cliff faces, were less affected by the foxes, he said.</p><p>"Wherever the puffins and gulls have come back after the removal of the foxes, the vegetation has started to become lusher again," Byrd said. "The terrestrial ecosystem was probably modified in more ways than we know, and maybe it won't be exactly like it was, but the conditions are there for a successful restoration of the native biodiversity."</p><p>______</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Croll at (831) 459-3610 or croll@biology.ucsc.edu; Estes at (831) 459-2820 or jestes@ucsc.edu; and Byrd at (907) 235-6546 or vernon_byrd@fws.gov.</p><p>Images are available on request from Tim Stephens in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4352 or stephens@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ea1348072704601a012ff62338e4a"><name>658</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Harlem activist Geoffrey Canada to speak at UCSC on April 12</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1111993200000</start-date><display-name>Harlem activist Geoffrey Canada...</display-name><path>/2005/03/658</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/658</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338103538</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338103538</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A tireless community activist, Geoffrey Canada has been described as "the brother who never left the 'hood because he keeps looking into the faces of the children and seeing himself there."</p><p>Canada will discuss his work on behalf of at-risk children and families during a free public lecture entitled "It Takes a 'Hood: Community Revitalization, Educational Reform, and the Harlem Children's Zone," on Tuesday, April 12, at 6:30 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room at UC Santa Cruz.

For the past eight years, students at UC Santa Cruz have flocked to a popular class taught by television consultant and UCSC alumnus Loren Steck for an inside look at the realities of an actual career in Hollywood.</p><p>Titled <i>Working in TV and Film,</i> the course brings in highly successful producers, directors, writers, and agents to give a candid, behind-the-scenes look at what their jobs are really like, how they got them, and the types of pressures and constraints they face on a day-to-day-basis. All of the guest lecturers are UCSC alumni.</p><p>At a recent class session, Dan Wolf, vice president of corporate communications at The Walt Disney Company, took 50 students through a whirlwind tour of his last 16 years at the company where he writes speeches, crafts press releases, and strategizes for top executives like celebrated CEO Michael Eisner. </p><p>Mixing autobiographical information with backstage details of the quirks and power struggles of the major players at Disney, Wolf shared insights about working at the company from an insider's point of view. At one point, he explained to the students how, while working as press secretary for Los Angeles Supervisor Kenneth Hahn in the early 1980s, he was offered a freelance job to write a speech for the president of Walt Disney Studios-despite the fact that had never written a speech before in his entire life.</p><p>"My advice is never to say no if there's a possibility offered to you in the industry," Wolf told the class. "Don't be intimidated. Because to a certain degree, everybody's faking it at every level. There's a lot of people at high levels of the film industry who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to pick successful movies and they fail miserably most of the time. So don't be fooled and think that people with titles, money, and cars are any smarter than you-they may be just as anxious and insecure."</p><p>"Things tend to be a little more exaggerated in the entertainment business," Wolf added. "There are less defined skill requirements in this world than for say an engineer. I'm actually one of the few people I know with a liberal arts education who actually uses the job skills I learned in college in my work. When I write a speech, what is it? It's a research paper that involves writing and critical-thinking skills."</p><p>Wolf was just one of the eight prominent visitors that Steck brought into the class this year. Other guests included David Tenzer, an agent at Creative Artists Agency; Karina Buck, president of Genuine Buck Film; and Jim Fredrick, senior vice president of creative advertising for Warner Brothers. Recent UCSC graduate Graham Rich also made an appearance, describing how some of the contacts he made in the class helped him to complete his first commercial feature film as producer and director.</p><p>Steck himself works in the industry as a consultant, "fixing television pilots and improving programs." He also works directly for the major television networks, advising them on what shows to buy and how to market them. A trustee of the UCSC Foundation for the past eight years, Steck said the idea for the class arose out of a conversation he had with former Porter College Provost Kathy Foley during his term as president of the UCSC Alumni Association in 1996. </p><p>"I knew so many alumni in the entertainment industry who so dearly love this campus," Steck recalled. "So I thought, how can I get them involved? It's really a way for them to give back, as well as an attempt to help young students and ease their transition into the real world."</p><p>The students seem to appreciate the effort. After the last class session in March, dozens of students gathered around Steck to thank him for offering the course. </p><p>"This class gives you the real deal," observed Alex Laleh, a senior film and digital media student. "Most students who come are hoping to get a job related to Hollywood, so they're thrilled to hear personal and realistic appraisals of how hard it is to get in the door. The class was as blunt and frank as possible. It showed the deeper layers of how the industry really works."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27a8ab28072704601a012ff81501d3c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626194059</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626194059</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27a8ab28072704601a012ff81501d3c"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/03/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/03/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626194059</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626194059</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
