The event is co-sponsored by the UCSC Women's Studies Department and admission is free.</p><p>The Koret Jewish Book Award is considered to be one of the highest honors for authors writing prose on Jewish themes. Baumgarten joins five other authors, including renowned Israeli novelist Amos Oz, as a 2005 recipient of the award. Each award carries a $10,000 prize, and the Koret Jewish Book Awards Ceremony this year will be the centerpiece of a Jewish Literary Arts Series in San Francisco. </p><p>Baumgarten was honored for her book, Mothers and Children: Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe, published by Princeton University Press and described as "a richly detailed and deeply researched contribution to our understanding of the relationship between Jews and their non-Jewish neighbors." She will speak at UCSC on the topic: "Women's Rites: Birth Ceremonies in Medieval Jewish Culture."</p><p>Baumgarten completed her doctorate in 2000 at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. She is a social historian and lecturer in the Department of Jewish History and the Gender Studies Program at Bar-Ilan University, specializing in the history of Jewish women, Jewish family life, and Jewish-Christian relations in medieval Ashkenaz. Baumgarten lives in Jerusalem with her husband and three children. </p><p>For more information, contact the UCSC Jewish Studies Program, at (831) 459-2566.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ea5708072704601a012fff0b1dcf0"><name>661</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sesnon Gallery features innovative exhibit by three new art faculty</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1112338800000</start-date><display-name>Sesnon Gallery features innovative...</display-name><path>/2005/04/661</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/661</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338104642</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338104642</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Innovative, kinetic, and sonic installations merging sculpture, electronic media, and performance art will be on display in Faculty Works: 2005 at UCSC's Sesnon Gallery. The exhibit, from April 6 to May 7, will feature works by three new art faculty: Dee Hibbert-Jones, Ed Osborn, and Jennifer Parker. </p><p>Dee Hibbert-Jones was recently hired as an assistant professor to develop the public art program at UCSC. Her current research explores the relationships between art, commerce, and mental health in a project she calls "Psychological Prosthetics." In collaboration with mental health workers, she has created (and patented) a brand of sculptural products designed to aid mental health disorders. The products employ sleek, high-tech designs with gadgetry attached such as LCD monitors, push-buttons for audio, and telescoping sections for portability. </p><p>Hibbert-Jones's creations include a "Separation Anxiety Disorder Teddy Backpack" and an "Attention Deficit Disorder Brace." She has also constructed a "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Security Vest"-complete with an LCD screen to cathartically retell a personal trauma story, a stress gauge connected to body temperature, and a walkie-talkie check-in device to monitor personal safety. </p><p>"Sculpture is an emotion made tangible," Hibbert-Jones explained. "I'm exploring the role of the artist as healer by creating a tangible product to soothe a mental health disorder. If someone is having an anxiety attack, I can give them something to hold or wear like a security blanket. I look at ideas like: 'How do you create an environment that creates an emotional response of safety?' or 'What kinds of things help?'"</p><p>Hibbert-Jones said she conceived her project while reflecting on the massive influence of the psycho-pharmaceutical industry. The presentation of her products mimics a corporate display, using the language of the pharmaceutical industry in text, logo, colors, and signage. "I'm turning the Sesnon Gallery into a trade show of psychological prosthetics," said Hibbert-Jones. "I'll have an infomercial about the products on display, banners advertising the products, and photos on the walls of people wearing and using the products."</p><p>Like political theater, Hibbert-Jones's work is both serious and satirical, with the intent of stimulating discussion of important issues related to mental illness, diagnosis, prescription, and treatment. The Sesnon installation will also include an interactive performance art aspect-outside the gallery, performers in lab coats will interview people about depression and anxiety to kick-start conversations about mental health.</p><p>Hibbert-Jones said that she will take the project on tour later this year to museums and galleries throughout the United States. She also noted that a portable "Psychological Prosthetics Trauma Unit" will tour Europe in 2006.</p><p>Assistant Professor Jennifer Parker's sculptures and installations combine found and manipulated sounds, organic material, video, and performances. Her contribution to the Faculty Works: 2005 exhibit will include Wigsuit, a performance sculpture consisting of a suit she constructed from over 100 wigs manufactured in Japan; and Self-Portrait, a piece created in response to the 2004 presidential elections made up of oil clay and digital images.</p><p>Parker will also exhibit a life-sized latex figure and skin with five crocheted speaker pods titled Skinned (Sound Residue). She said the work was created "as a result of thinking about sound as vibration.waves bounding off the body or being absorbed by the body. I imagined silence-a figure with no ears, having recently hatched or shed her skin.and of sounds embedded in the skin.left behind as residue of her life."</p><p>Ed Osborn, assistant professor of electronic and digital media, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and is now based in Oakland and Berlin. His sound art pieces come in a variety of forms, including installations, sculpture, radio, video, and public performance projects. Osborn's works range from rumbling fans and sounding train sets to squirming music boxes and delicate feedback networks. </p><p>For the Sesnon exhibit, Osborn will create a remix of Attempting Ziggurats, based on the story of the Tower of Babel and its ongoing reverberations in American culture. "The forms of social, political, and economic organizations needed to build the Tower of Babel--those of a massive system of coercion in service of an enormous and delusional task--are ones that recur frequently in American history," Osborn noted. </p><p>_____</p><p>An opening reception will be held on Wednesday, April 6, from 5 to 7 p.m. Sesnon Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. A lecture series with a talk by each of the artists will take place at Porter College Faculty Gallery: Dee Hibbert-Jones, 4/12; Ed Osborn, 4/13; and Jennifer Parker, 4/20.

The plant sale will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.</p><p>A wide variety of native and exotic plants will be available at the sale, including attractive selections of Grevillea, manzanita, pincushion protea, Salvia, succulents, and tea tree. Knowledgeable Arboretum staff and volunteers will be on hand to answer questions. </p><p>The Arboretum's sale is held in conjunction with the spring plant sale of the California Native Plant Society. Both sales are open early (from 10 a.m. to noon) to members of the Arboretum Associates and the California Native Plant Society, and to the general public from noon to 4 p.m.</p><p>A complete list of the plants available at the Arboretum sale will be posted at <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">arboretum.ucsc.edu</a> by April 8. A few of the many plants that will be available are described below. </p><p>Banksia spinulosa 'Red Rock' is a selection with exceptionally large, golden 6- to 8-inch long flowerheads that are well displayed among the linear serrated leaves. This shrub grows 8 feet tall and about as wide. It is best grown in well-drained acidic soils in partial or full sun. There will also be other banksias for sale, including Banksia baxteri. </p><p>No garden is complete without Leptospermum 'Queen of Hearts', a hybrid created by the Arboretum's founding director, Ray Collett. This is a low-growing, spreading plant with profuse 1-inch open white flowers with reddish sepals. The flowers smell like butter and cinnamon. Leptospermum turbinatum, the Grampians tea tree, is a larger shrub with shiny elliptical leaves and white-to-cream blossoms.    </p><p>Other plants from the Australian collection include many different flower colors of Anigozanthus flavidus (kangaroo paws), Patersonia glabrata, and Adenanthos sericea. From the South African collection, look for Leucospermum cordifolium 'Yellow Bird' and others.</p><p>California natives available from the Arboretum will include Romneya coulteri, the Matilija poppy, with its gigantic white flowers with yellow centers. Two low ground covers, Arctostaphylos edmundsii 'Little Sur' and Ceanothus hearstiorum will be available. For a large shrub, try Malosma laurina (laurel sumac) and enjoy its aromatic leaves and clouds of tiny white flowers in early summer. The Arboretum will also be selling Dudleya viscida, a native succulent that makes a nice addition to a rock garden. This plant is rarely for sale, except at the Arboretum and one or two specialty nurseries. Dudleya viscida is a narrow endemic from southern California that has open pink flowers on compact inflorescences and fragrant, shiny lime-green leaves.</p><p>For more information about the sale, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ea8658072704601a012ffcb13176c"><name>663</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC to lead ambitious multidisciplinary research project on wireless communication networks</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1112598000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC to lead ambitious...</display-name><path>/2005/04/663</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/663</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338105381</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338105381</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, are leading a major collaborative effort to develop the technology for complex wireless communication networks that can be set up in rapidly changing environments such as battlefields and emergency situations. Faculty in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering will head a multidisciplinary team of scientists at seven major universities working on the Dynamic Ad-hoc Wireless Networks (DAWN) project. </p><p>The project also includes researchers at UC Berkeley, UCLA, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Maryland, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). It is funded by a five-year grant from the U.S. Department of Defense that will provide an average of $1 million per year spread among the seven institutions. </p><p>J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Jack Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering at UCSC and the principal investigator on the DAWN project, said the methods and protocols developed for this project will have widespread applications. The research is of particular interest to the U.S. Army to enable troops to deploy mobile communications networks on the battlefield. But such networks could also be used by emergency personnel in the aftermath of an earthquake or other disaster in which pre-existing communications infrastructure has been knocked out. In addition, mobile and adaptable wireless networking may find more commonplace applications in the increasingly wireless world of modern communications.</p><p>"Even today, with the widespread use of wireless technology, little is understood about how wireless networks can scale up and become part of the Internet at large. We really need to develop a science of wireless networking," Garcia-Luna-Aceves said. </p><p>The DAWN project aims to establish the fundamental principles, tools, and methodologies needed to design reliable and efficient wireless networks. So far, the methods that have been applied in wireless networks have been derived from the wired world, Garcia-Luna-Aceves said. But ad-hoc wireless networks are complex systems with interactions and dynamics that do not occur in wired networks. </p><p>An ad-hoc wireless network is a self-organizing system of wireless devices in which individual nodes may move randomly and organize themselves into an unpredictable and rapidly changing network. The impact of a wireless transmission is not confined to a stable set of point-to-point links, as in a wired network, but reaches any receiver within its range. Interference at a receiver is a complex function of the characteristics of the wireless devices and the terrain or physical environment in which they are operating.</p><p>"We need a mathematical framework that will allow us to model the more complex world of the wireless environment. In the past, we have made many assumptions just to make the modeling tractable, but now we will be pushing the envelope," Garcia-Luna-Aceves said. </p><p>Garcia-Luna-Aceves has been working in the area of wireless networking for many years and has led several successful projects to develop small-scale mobile wireless networks. The DAWN project is an interdisciplinary effort to advance this research to a larger scale. By developing an understanding of how large-scale wireless networks operate, the project will lay the foundation for greater accessibility to the Internet, Garcia-Luna-Aceves said. </p><p>"For the Internet to become more pervasive, people need to have access wherever they are. Wireless networking will enable the Internet to be even more useful than it is today," he said.</p><p>The DAWN team includes some of the top researchers in the field of networking, and Garcia-Luna-Aceves noted that UCSC's leadership of the project is indicative of the campus's stature in the field. </p><p>"We are leading the best universities in the field on this project, and I think that's a recognition that UCSC is doing first-rate research in networking," Garcia-Luna-Aceves said.</p><p>In addition to Garcia-Luna-Aceves, the UCSC faculty involved in the project include Katia Obraczka, associate professor of computer engineering, and Hamid Sadjadpour, assistant professor of electrical engineering. Other major contributors include Tony Ephremides at University of Maryland, Andrea Goldsmith at Stanford, Jennifer Hou and Nitin Vaidya at UIUC, Mario Gerla and Rajive Bagrodia at UCLA, Muriel Medard at MIT, and Pravin Varaiya at UC Berkeley.</p><p>The DAWN grant is one of 33 research grants awarded this year under the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) program. The grant will provide support for 19 graduate students, including at least four at UCSC. Industry collaborations will provide additional support for students through summer internships. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Garcia-Luna-Aceves at (831) 459-4153 or jj@cse.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914eaa518072704601a012ff91c69f56"><name>664</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ecologist Erika Zavaleta receives prestigious Mellon Foundation grant</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1112598000000</start-date><display-name>Ecologist Erika Zavaleta receives...</display-name><path>/2005/04/664</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/664</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338105862</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338105862</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Erika Zavaleta, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has received a prestigious grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to investigate the ecological impacts of the loss of plant species in California ecosystems.</p><p>Through a program that supports the research projects of outstanding junior faculty, Zavaleta has been awarded a three-year, $200,000 grant. A maximum of only three such awards are presented each year.</p><p>Zavaleta, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2003, conducts research on the ecological impacts of biodiversity change. She is particularly interested in understanding the ecosystem effects of a decline in the number of plant species, including impacts on nutrient cycling and retention, productivity, and community and ecosystem resilience.  </p><p>The grant will support observational field research and an experimental study of the effects of removing vulnerable species from two key ecosystems: vernal pool and grassland habitats in central California.</p><p>Zavaleta's work fills a gap that persists because most studies on the ecology of species decline and extinction have focused on vertebrate animals, not plants. </p><p>"Despite the fact that plant species are declining and disappearing at an alarming rate around the world, we have only a marginal understanding of the ecological consequences of these declines," said Zavaleta, who described California as "a global hotspot for threatened plant diversity."</p><p>Zavaleta's project will focus on non-random loss of rare and vulnerable plants.  "Most species in ecosystems, and most at-risk species, are relatively uncommon," said Zavaleta. "They exert what influence they have in relatively small numbers."</p><p>In a pilot study in 2003-04, Zavaleta found that losses of even very rare species have a large impact on ecosystem productivity, colonization by other species, and water consumption. Her finding that declining biodiversity greatly reduced resistance to invasive species has important implications for resource managers. The new grant will enable Zavaleta to improve and expand on the pilot study to explore the mechanisms underlying the documented effects.</p><p>The observational study will compare approximately 500 currently threatened plant species and their nonthreatened relatives to explore whether they possess, as a group, unique or distinct characteristics, such as size, structure, life history, and defenses. "This will be the first phylogenetically controlled study of plant species vulnerability that we know of," said Zavaleta.</p><p>In the experimental study, Zavaleta will manipulate a small number of species in a single type of ecosystem to measure the ecological consequences of removing or reducing species.

Hulvey and a postdoctoral researcher will collaborate with Zavaleta, who will also work with colleagues at other universities.</p><p>	</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Erika Zavaleta may be reached at (831) 459-5011 or via e-mail at zavaleta@ucsc.edu. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914eabce8072704601a012ffb5fb6af3"><name>665</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz celebrates 40th anniversary with exhibit of early years at Cowell College</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1112857200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz celebrates...</display-name><path>/2005/04/665</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/665</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338106271</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338106271</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p></p><p></p><p>Cowell College opened in the fall of 1965 as a "challenging and imaginative experiment" undertaken by 650 students and 40 faculty members.</p><p>In celebration of its 40th anniversary, the college will present an exhibition titled Reminiscing: Cowell College, The Early Years, focusing on historical highlights from 1965 to 1975. The exhibit runs from April 16 to May 29 at the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery.</p><p>"I think what most people don't realize is that the history of Cowell and the early years of the university are one and the same," noted Linda Pope, curator of the gallery and the exhibit. "Cowell was the only college in existence when UC Santa Cruz was founded in 1965."</p><p>Pope said the exhibit will feature long-forgotten and little-known memorabilia and artwork--including a large flowered, psychedelic Andy Warhol rug that graced the provost's house until as late as the early 1990s. She added that the walls of the gallery will be covered with black-and-white photographs, letters, documents, and quotations illustrating the history of Cowell.</p><p>"I'm trying to come up with something different-things that haven't been seen before," said Pope. "I hope to use some very unusual early shots by Ansel Adams, an early protest poster, and some works by artists from the Cowell Press. The exhibit will show the clothing of the period and the feel of the times."</p><p>Adding to the historical atmosphere, a mix tape of music from the era will play in the background. Visitors will also be able to watch Super 8 films made by former students of the actual construction of Cowell College in the 1960s. Additional footage will include an interview with the late art history professor Mary Holmes about the early days of Cowell, and founding provost Page Smith being interviewed on CBS's 60 Minutes about the subject of education.</p><p>The adjoining Annex Gallery will also feature a display of watercolors by Cowell icon Jasper Rose, the innovative art professor and second provost of the college who now resides in England.</p><p>"I think it's going to be a fun exhibition and a great showcase of previously inaccessible items that Linda had to dig up," said Tyrus Miller, newly appointed in January as joint provost of Cowell with his wife, Deanna Shemek. "It's a chance for people to experience the strong sense of community, personality, and tradition at Cowell that goes back many years." </p><p>Alumni visiting the campus during the Banana Slug Spring Fair weekend will have an opportunity to meet the new provosts during a special April 16 reception in the gallery between 4 and 6 p.m. The opening reception for the exhibit--featuring live music and refreshments--begins earlier that same day at 2 p.m. For more information, contact the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery at (831) 459-2953.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ead678072704601a012ffb684eb44"><name>666</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Living Writers series brings guest authors/poets into UC Santa Cruz classes</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1113289200000</start-date><display-name>Living Writers series brings...</display-name><path>/2005/04/666</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/666</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338106629</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338106629</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Each quarter, the Humanities Division's Living Writers Series brings eight to 10 visiting authors and poets into UCSC classes to give students an in-depth look into the world of the working writer. </p><p>Sponsored by the campus's Institute for Humanities Research and the Porter College Hitchcock Poetry Fund, the series is coordinated by associate professors of literature Micah Perks and Karen Yamashita, codirectors of the UCSC Creative Writing Program.</p><p>"Our primary goal is to bring in people whose work we think will reach the students and broaden their horizons," said Perks. "We really try to bring a large variety of writers-people just starting out, those who have been around a long time, older people, younger people-to give students a sense of what's possible in the writing life and how the choices they make will affect their lives and work."</p><p>The spring 2005 schedule will include guests such as Vietnamese American writer Linh Dinh, novelist Stephen Elliott, and poet Elizabeth Willis. It will also feature visits by Patricia Wakida, an editor at Heyday Press in Berkeley, and Larry Siems, director of the "Freedom to Write" international program of the PEN American Center in New York City.</p><p>"I wanted to bring Larry in because I think he's an ideal person to talk about censorship issues and how writing can be dangerous," Yamashita noted. "I always want students to think about the integrity of their work and the consequences of their writing. And we're bringing in Patricia especially for students in the Senior Fiction Project--to give them an idea of what it's like to be an editor in the publishing industry and to point them in other directions related to writing."</p><p>Yamashita added that one of the benefits of the Living Writers Series is to help create a network in the publishing industry and to facilitate contacts for internships. </p><p>"Another guest this quarter will be Susan McCloskey, one of our very talented former students who is now the buyer for fiction at Bookshop Santa Cruz," Yamashita said. "She'll talk about what it's like to work in a bookshop-the process, the ins and outs of promotion, how she selects books. We're trying to show students there's a world out there that they might not be aware of; it's a way of informing them about possibilities."</p><p>Both Perks and Yamashita are themselves highly accomplished writers. Perks's first published short story, in Epoch magazine, was nominated for the prestigious Pushcart Prize. She has written a memoir, Pagan Time: An American Childhood (2001); a novel of historic fiction, We Are Gathered Here (1996); as well as a variety of short stories that have appeared in numerous anthologies and literary magazines.  </p><p>Yamashita is the author of Through the Arc of the Rain Forest (1990), which received the American Book Award, and Brazil-Maru, named by the Village Voice as one of the 25 best books of 1992. Her third novel, Tropic of Orange (1997), was a finalist for the Paterson Fiction Prize, and she followed that with Circle K Cycles (2001), a book based on her research of the Brazilian community in Japan.</p><p>Perks said that the Living Writers Series has particularly struck a chord with advanced students in the Creative Writing Program. </p><p>"The students benefit by learning how real working writers live, rather than the 10 percent who actually make a living from creative writing every year," she observed.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914eaf078072704601a012fff591e0af"><name>667</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Melissa Jurica earns prestigious grant from Searle Scholars Program</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1113375600000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Melissa Jurica earns...</display-name><path>/2005/04/667</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/667</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338107094</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338107094</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Searle Scholars Program has awarded Melissa Jurica, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a three-year, $240,000 grant to support her research. Jurica, who studies the complex system by which human cells process genetic information, is one of just 15 young scientists awarded the prestigious grants this year.</p>
<p>The Searle Scholars Program makes grants to selected universities and research centers to support the independent research of exceptional young faculty in the biomedical sciences. This is the first year that UCSC has been invited to participate in the program. Jurica, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2003, is the campus's first Searle Scholar.</p>
<p>Jurica's research focuses on a tiny molecular machine known as the spliceosome, which edits the genetic code before the code gets translated into the protein molecules that carry out a vast range of biological functions.</p>
<p>"It's like when you shoot a movie and you don't need all the footage, you cut some parts out and splice together the parts you want. That's what the spliceosome does with gene sequences," Jurica said.</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with the idea of genes as DNA sequences in the chromosomes. The genetic information in a gene is encoded in the sequence of chemical building blocks (As, Cs, Gs, and Ts) in the linear DNA molecule. When a gene is active, its DNA sequence gets copied into an RNA messenger, but the information there isn't actually ready to be used--it needs to be edited before it can direct the synthesis of proteins.</p>
<p>"RNA splicing is absolutely necessary for gene expression, and there are cancers and other diseases associated with problems in splicing," Jurica said.</p>
<p>In some cases, the same gene sequence can be edited in different ways, so that one gene can produce a variety of different protein molecules. This phenomenon, known as "alternative splicing," is especially common in humans. It is the primary explanation for the surprisingly small number of genes scientists have been able to identify in the complete human genome sequence.</p>
<p>The spliceosome is the key to understanding how the body's cells control the process of alternative splicing to ensure that the right protein gets made at the right place and time. But the spliceosome is extraordinarily complex and difficult to study. It is composed of more than 100 different proteins and several different RNA molecules that come together to form a highly dynamic and complicated structure.</p>
<p>The assembled spliceosome is about one millionth of an inch in diameter. Jurica is using several techniques to study the structure of the spliceosome, including electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography. She is also using biochemical techniques to investigate how the spliceosome is assembled from smaller components and how it carries out its functions.</p>
<p>Jurica is affiliated with UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, where she is able to consult and collaborate with scientists involved in similar research. For example, Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, studies RNA splicing in yeast, focusing in part on the effects of mutations and environmental changes on the regulation of alternative splicing. Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology and director of the RNA Center, has used x-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the ribosome, another complex molecular machine, which carries out protein synthesis.</p>
<p>"The collaborative environment of the RNA Center makes it a good place to do structural biology on the spliceosome. There are great structural biologists and splicing experts here," Jurica said.</p>
<p>The Searle Scholars Program was established at the Chicago Community Trust in 1980. It is funded from the estates of Mr. and Mrs. John G. Searle. Mr. Searle was the grandson of the founder of the pharmaceutical company G. D. Searle &amp; Company. It was Mr. Searle's wish that certain funds be used to support research in medicine, chemistry, and biology. To achieve this goal, grants are made to selected academic institutions to support the independent research of outstanding individuals who are in the first or second year of their first appointment at the assistant professor level, and whose current appointment is a tenure-track position.</p>

Flyers promote live music, entertainment, speeches, and student-taught courses.</p><p>While organizers claim that these activities are covered by "free speech" rights and are authorized by UCSC, campus officials have denied and discredited all claims that the advertised plans are sanctioned and will be allowed. Instead, if plans for erecting a "tent university" proceed, the university will enforce all relevant university policies and will apply maximum sanctions against violators. </p><p>"This is not an issue of free speech," said Chancellor Denice D. Denton.  "Rather, it is a matter of ensuring students' safety and protecting the orderly conduct of our educational mission. Well-intentioned but uninformed students could jeopardize their academic careers because they don't understand the seriousness of the situation. While we fully support civil debate, open dialogue, and alternative educational experiences, we cannot ensure the safety of large numbers of students camping for an extended period at the entrance to the campus."</p><p>University officials have been in discussion with students for several weeks to consider another more suitable venue at which cultural and educational events can occur outside of the classroom environment.  They also are seeking the support of local elected officials in their effort to thwart the creation of a campsite at the base of campus.</p><p>Modeled after "no camping" ordinances in the City of Santa Cruz, university policy as set forth in the Student Policies and Regulations Handbook (102.27b) prohibits camping on university-owned, controlled, or leased property. </p><p>Students violating these policies are subject to a range of consequences, up to and including fines, restitution, and suspension or dismissal from the university. If state laws or county ordinances are broken, then violators also will be subject to legal action.</p><p> "A university is the ideal venue for sharing ideas and working for positive change, but it is important for students to realize that there are consequences for violating university policies," Denton emphasized. "We encourage and welcome civil discourse, but the kind of event being promoted doesn't fit that description." </p><p>There are serious health and safety issues involved with the "tent university" scenario. The location would generate 24-hr. noise from loudspeakers and live music, disturbing the campus community, the child care center, and nearby neighbors. The danger of fire is a serious concern, as are sanitation and food preparation.</p><p>UCSC actively supports free speech and provides a multitude of opportunities for students to engage in productive discussion about a range of issues. There are several areas on campus where information may be distributed. Events with sponsored speakers and other venues for discussion and debate abound.

The series is part of the university's 40th anniversary celebration this year.</p>
<p>The Marie Beckham Arboretum Music Series, will present folk, classical, cultural, and jazz performers on the third Thursdays of the month from April through September. Performers this year include tenor saxophonist Dave Ellis, Hawaiian slack key guitarist Patrick Landeza, Linda Tillery &amp; The Cultural Heritage Choir, the Cypress String Quartet, and the Chicano folk-fusion band, Quetzal.</p>
<p>"It's a beautiful setting," said Stephen McCabe, coordinator of research and education for the Arboretum. "With the abundant rain this year, the Arboretum's flowers are outstanding this spring. Patrons will walk past or take a wagon shuttle by the flowering gardens to get to the outdoor amphitheater."</p>
<p>McCabe added that the concert series is named in honor of Marie Beckham "who has been tirelessly volunteering in many capacities at the Arboretum for the last 30 years, and has previously helped bring concerts to other venues in the Arboretum."</p>
<p>The 2005 Lineup:</p>
<p>Thursday, April 21--Keith Greeninger plus Dayan Kai and Band</p>

<p>Singer/songwriter Keith Greeninger has drawn comparisons to Jackson Browne and Bruce Cockburn for the soulfulness and imagery of his phrasing and the power of his voice. He first started gaining attention on the national music scene in 1989 as a principal songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist for the groundbreaking trio City Folk. The group was known for its powerful lyrics, harmony, and instrumental virtuosity, and quickly became one of the prominent new folk acts in northern California. Greeninger has just put the finishing touches on his second album, Back to You, on which he is joined by local Santa Cruz favorite, Water. Doors open at 5:15 p.m. Show starts at 6:15 p.m. Tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door, Arboretum members $10.</p>
<p>Thursday, May 19--Linda Tillery &amp; The Cultural Heritage Choir</p>
<p>In 1992, Linda Tillery came across a treasure trove of field recordings of traditional African American music. Within months she had assembled the Cultural Heritage Choir, a six-member ensemble to perform spirituals, work and play songs, field hollers, and other slave songs in the folk tradition. The group is one of the vital performing ensembles in its field, bringing traditional forms of African American culture to the stage. In addition to songs and chants, delivered through such stylistic forms as call-and-response, multilayered harmonies, and repetitive verse, the CHC repertoire includes intoned sermons, folk tales, polyrhythmic percussion, and dance.</p>
<p>Thursday, June 16--The Cypress Quartet</p>
<p>Founded in 1996 in San Francisco, the Cypress String Quartet has performed to great acclaim at prominent venues worldwide, playing sold-out concerts at the Kennedy Center, the Ravinia Festival, and Stanford Lively Arts. Praised by the Los Angeles Times for their "musical astuteness and virtuoso resources," quartet members Cecily Ward, Tom Stone, Ethan Filner, and Jennifer Kloetzel strive to reach a large and diverse audience through an extensive touring schedule and an array of innovative education and outreach programs. The quartet is also widely known as a champion of American music. Having commissioned and performed 10 original works by leading American composers, the Cypress recently won an Aaron Copland Award.</p>
<p>Thursday, July 21--Quetzal</p>
<p>From Los Angeles, Quetzal has built a strong reputation as a catalyst for Chicano/Latino music. Blending a variety of music traditions--including son, vera cruz, rock 'n' roll, and traditional Mexican ballads--Quetzal has created a new music scene reflecting the diverse mix of Mexican sounds in the United States. In the past several years, the six-member group has toured extensively with artists such as Taj Mahal, Ozomatli, and Los Lobos. The group also has two full-length albums to its credit, the self-titled Quetzal and the 2003 release Sing The Real, produced by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin.</p>
<p>Thursday, August 18th--Dave Ellis Trio</p>
<p>Tenor saxophonist Dave Ellis was named Best New Talent (along with Diana Krall) in the 1997 Jazziz magazine Readers Poll. In 1992, Ellis became a pioneer in California's nascent "new jazz" movement, teaming up with eight-string guitarist Charlie Hunter and drummer Jay Lane to form the immensely popular Charlie Hunter Trio. After recording for Les Claypool's Prawn Song label, the trio signed to Blue Note, which brought them national attention. State of Mind, his debut recording for Milestone, has received international acclaim and was selected as the 2004 California Music Award for Outstanding Jazz Album of the Year.</p>
<p>Thursday, September 15--Patrick Landeza</p>

<p>Patrick Landeza is considered to be a leading performer of Hawaiian slack key guitar, or ki ho'alu, one of the world's great acoustic guitar traditions. His career highlights include becoming the first slack key artist to perform the national anthem at a major league baseball game and opening for legendary Hawaiian musicians Israel "Bruddah Iz" Kamakawiwo'ole, Keali'i Reichel, and HAPA. Noted pianist and ki ho'alu player George Winston says "Patrick Landeza is one of the best and most dedicated of the new generation of slack key players."</p>

Sponsored by UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies, the research group is composed of graduate students and faculty engaged in the study of women of color. </p><p>The theme of this year's festival is "Disrupting Borders: Seeing Silences and Imagining Trans-Formations." The films range from Anita Wen-Shin Chang's 52-minute film about discovering the political sensibility of her 100-year-old Taiwanese activist grandmother and Nicole Willis's documentary exploring the impact of incarceration on mothers and children in Texas, to Boi Hair, Alma Lopez's documentary short about queer women of color and their short hair, and La Tortilla, a seven-minute short by UCSC alumna Azucena Varela that shows how tortilla makers are sculptors that conjure up the past as they shape maize dough to feed present and future generations.</p><p>"They're all very different films-it's a diverse mix of dramas, documentaries, and some comedy," noted Susy Zepeda, codirector of the festival. "We put out a call for films and people responded. There are three films from Mexico, one from Bangladesh, and other submissions from New York, Texas, and Washington State." </p><p>"Our goal is to understand what is actually happening in the lives of women of color-to map the territory of where they are today," Zepeda added. "The focus is not just on the negative aspects but also to explore the possibilities for change and transformation."</p><p>Zepeda said that the 2005 festival will include panel discussions and four keynote speakers who will discuss why they created their films. Performances of African folk-fusion music, rap, and spoken word will also be presented. </p><p>"Most of the filmmakers will be attending the festival," Zepeda noted. "We're very excited about this opportunity to foster communication and dialogue about women of color."</p><p>All events at the Women of Color Film and Video Festival are free and open to the public. Light refreshments will be provided. For more information contact the festival's codirectors: Susy Zepeda at szepeda@ucsc.edu or Roya Rastegar at rrastega@ucsc.edu.

Long is the first faculty member to hold the endowed chair, established in 2004 with a $1 million gift from Kumar Malavalli, cofounder of Brocade Communications and cofounder and CEO of InMage Systems. </p><p>Long directs the Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC) at UCSC and also serves as associate dean for research and graduate studies in UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering. He said the funds from the endowed chair would provide support for research, graduate students, and other activities of the SSRC, a leading center for research on data storage and storage systems.</p><p>"I see this endowment as recognition for the excellence of the research conducted by the SSRC as a whole. The center will benefit greatly from having this permanent source of support," Long said.</p><p>The mission of the SSRC is to improve the performance and profitability of the data storage industry through a strong focus on the software and systems aspects of data storage. Research in the SSRC focuses on caching, storage systems hierarchies, peta-scale storage systems, distributed storage systems, and security and performance. </p><p>Data storage technology has come to play a crucial role in modern society, as everything from business information to medical and financial records for individuals is stored on computers and must be available for efficient and secure access. The sheer volume of digital reference data that must be stored and accessed is increasing dramatically. Data storage makes headlines when criminals break into databases and obtain the personal information of thousands of people. But security is just one of many technical challenges in the area of storage systems.</p><p>Malavalli has made major contributions in storage systems and storage area networks. He was for many years the chief technical officer of Brocade Communications, the leading provider of storage area networking infrastructure, which he cofounded in 1995. He is also one of the principal architects of Fibre Channel technology, a high-speed data transfer technology used in storage networks. In 2003, Malavalli was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council Hall of Fame for his contributions to technology. </p><p>Long's appointment to the Malavalli Chair is for a five-year term. He has an international reputation as a leader in storage systems research, with more than 120 research publications and numerous patents related to storage systems.</p><p>Long has broad research interests in the area of computing systems, including operating systems, distributed systems, high-performance storage systems, fault tolerance, performance evaluation, and mobile computing. His research is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and other agencies, as well as by various industry partners. He has received an IBM Faculty Award and several IBM Research Invention Achievement Awards.</p><p>A senior member of the Computer Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Long served as chair of the society's Technical Committee on Operating Systems and now serves on the Executive Committee. He is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and serves as chair of the Scholars Committee for the Usenix Association. Long earned a B.S. in computer science from San Diego State University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from UC San Diego. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1988.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Long at (831) 459-2616 or darrell@cs.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914eb6bc8072704601a012ff16503bfa"><name>672</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz New Teacher Center gets $300,000 from Goldman Sachs Foundation</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1113807600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz New...</display-name><path>/2005/04/672</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/672</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338109072</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338109072</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The pace of growth and expansion at the UC Santa Cruz New Teacher Center will accelerate thanks to a $300,000 grant from the Goldman Sachs Foundation.</p><p>The funding will bolster the center's organizational infrastructure and support the rapid growth of the New Teacher Center (NTC), which leads the nation in the development of support programs for new teachers. </p><p>Since opening in 1998, the NTC has become a national resource for teacher training. </p><p>Research shows that teacher quality is the most important variable in student performance, and the NTC provides support during the critical first two years of a new teacher's career.

The result was an interactive, real-time performance where UC Santa Cruz dancers performed in front of three "liquid screens" upon which live images of the New York University dancers were simultaneously projected. </p><p>The project was conceived by new UC Santa Cruz assistant theater arts professor Ted Warburton and carried out in his movement research class last quarter. UC Santa Cruz's technical staff provided the expertise and instruction that eventually enabled students to run all of the technical aspects of the performances. </p><p>"I believe this is the first course in the U.S. to offer students both the opportunity to perform and to acquire the technical knowledge necessary to produce this type of event," noted Warburton. "We had both groups of performers on opposite sides of the country working together-interconnected and interdependent-using advanced telecommunications for artistic collaborative purposes."</p><p>Warburton has danced professionally with American Ballet Theatre and holds a doctoral degree in psychology from Harvard, as well as a master's in technology. He came to UC Santa Cruz last summer from New York University where he served as the director of its dance program. As a result, he invited Ben Munisteri, an award-winning choreographer who recently decided to attend graduate school at NYU, to collaborate from New York. Together, they set up a series of video-conferencing sessions to help create the event. </p><p> "There is a strong research component to this project," added Warburton. "We're interested in how students' perceptions of technology change and whether the technology is inhibiting or enabling creativity."</p><p>"There is not much research on distance education and zero research on arts distance education," he noted. "This is a new genre of art, and we are doing creative research pushing the boundaries of the dance discipline." </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ec0178072704601a012ffa1387212"><name>676</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz sponsors first 'good neighbor' community forum May 12</title><author>Kristen Townsend (831) 459-1768; gni_ucsc@yahoo.com</author><start-date>1114671600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz sponsors...</display-name><path>/2005/04/676</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/676</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338111466</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338111466</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-4058</phone><email>review@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The first in a series of "Good Neighbor Forums" sponsored by UC Santa Cruz will take place Thursday, May 12, from 6 to 9 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room at Harbor High School. The topic of the discussion, which is open to all members of the university and town community, will be the promotion of tolerance and a safe atmosphere in the public spaces of our diverse community.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">Focus will be on cultivating tolerance in the public spaces of our diverse community</font></b></td></tr></table>From beaches and parks to public school campuses and downtown sidewalks, public spaces are designed to be welcoming to all. Do we, as a community, ensure that all our public spaces are used and enjoyed by everyone? This gathering will provide a forum for discussion and an opportunity to address the question, "What is needed to make individuals feel safe and comfortable in public spaces around Santa Cruz?"</p><p>Featured speakers will address different aspects of the issue. UCSC sociology professor John Brown Childs will discuss his vision of how groups can preserve their uniqueness while engaging across race, class, and gender, and former Santa Cruz mayor Scott Kennedy will discuss ways to diffuse potentially volatile situations. School and local government officials, as well as local residents and representatives of the university and community organizations, are encouraged to attend.</p><p>The event is being presented by the UCSC Good Neighbor Initiative, which was launched last fall to build and maintain better relations with the Santa Cruz community. UCSC undergraduates Kristen Townsend and Anthony Tucci are directing the initiative under the auspices of the campus's Office of Government and Community Relations. The Santa Cruz Community Good Neighbor Advisory Board is a network of people working to increase discussion about what it means to be good neighbors in a community that cares about its citizens.</p><p>"We've heard from students of color on campus and from some students at local high schools who say they avoid certain places because they feel unsafe or unwelcome," said Donna Blitzer, director of the UCSC Office of Government and Community Relations. "We want to provide a forum for information sharing and brainstorming, so we can collaborate on ways to make our community more welcoming and comfortable for everyone."</p><p>Participants are encouraged to share their experiences with exclusion and inclusion in the community and to offer input regarding changes they would like to see.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ec1a38072704601a012ffb4d79174"><name>677</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Former chancellor, environmentalist are elected to American Academy of Arts and Sciences</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1114671600000</start-date><display-name>Former chancellor, environmentalist are...</display-name><path>/2005/04/677</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/677</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338111849</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338111849</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two scholars affiliated with UC Santa Cruz have been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), one of the most prestigious honors bestowed upon the world's leading scientists, academics, artists, businesspeople, and public leaders.</p><p>Former chancellor M.R.C.

But are they just a temporary aberration, destined to shrink in the years to come? </p><p>That is the hypothesis championed by Gerald Weber, lecturer emeritus in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. According to Weber, northern Monterey Bay beaches have been kept abnormally wide over the past 200 to 300 years by an excess of sand drifting down the coast from a large temporary source north of Año Nuevo. That source is now exhausted. Beaches just south of Año Nuevo have already shrunk in the past 30 years, and Weber said he expects that trend to spread slowly south to Santa Cruz and beyond. </p><p>"Beaches down drift from Point Año Nuevo have shrunk drastically over the past 25 to 30 years, and sea-cliff erosion is accelerating," Weber said.</p><p>Other geologists, however, do not anticipate dramatic changes. Gary Griggs, professor of Earth sciences at UCSC and an expert on coastal erosion, said he believes that the dune fields north of Año Nuevo provided only a small fraction of the sand nourishing Santa Cruz beaches. </p><p>"Losing the Año Nuevo sand supply may not have a significant effect on beaches in the Monterey Bay because of the large amount of littoral sand supplied by other sources," Griggs said.</p><p>Weber said he is used to that kind of skepticism. "When I first presented this idea in 1981, people thought I was nuts," he said. But he said he has accumulated more evidence over the past 20 years.</p><p>Weber will make his case this week in a presentation on Friday, April 29, at a joint regional meeting of the American Geological Society and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in San Jose.</p><p>Beaches are constantly remodeled by coastal currents that bring sand in and take it away. Along the northern California coastline, the current runs northwest to southeast. Santa Cruz beaches contain material from as far north as Half Moon Bay, Weber said.</p><p>A thin beach leaves cliffs exposed to the erosive power of waves, eventually causing the coastline to recede. As cliffs crumble, the beach widens, until an equilibrium is reached in which the beach remains wide enough to protect the cliffs from further erosion.</p><p>In Santa Cruz County, the equilibrium was tipped toward wider beaches some 300 years ago, when Año Nuevo Island separated from the mainland, perhaps as the result of an earthquake on the San Gregorio fault. A channel formed between the island and Point Año Nuevo, opening the way for sand trapped north of the point to gradually drift down the coast to more southern beaches. The extra sand made southern beaches wider, buffering the cliffs from the waves.</p><p>After releasing 13 to 20 million cubic yards of sand through the channel, the northern sand sources are now exhausted, Weber said. Southern beaches, no longer receiving an excess of sand drifting from the north, have started to shrink, and cliff erosion is poised to resume. The phenomenon is particularly pronounced at Point Año Nuevo and Greyhound Rock, three miles south of Point Año Nuevo, where beaches have receded by 60 to 75 feet over the past 30 years, Weber said.</p><p>Weber said he expects the phenomenon to spread further south within the next 20 to 100 years.</p><p>"A period of thin beaches and increased coastal erosion in northern Monterey Bay is near," Weber said.</p><p>Griggs said he does not dispute the depletion of the sand sources north of Año Nuevo. But he said the amount of sand they contributed--approximately 50,000 cubic yards per year, according to Weber's estimates--is small compared to the river of sand traveling southward along the coast--some 250,000 cubic yards per year. "What I question is the magnitude of the effect," he said. </p><p>Sand travels along the central California coast at approximately one mile per year. Santa Cruz beaches, 15 to 20 miles south of Año Nuevo, should have begun to show the effects of a decreased sand supply by now. But they have not been shrinking, Griggs said. The effect of the Año Nuevo sands might be too dilute to have a discernible impact by the time they reach Santa Cruz, he said.   </p><p>Weber said he expects a decrease in beach width to take place over an extended period of time, just as the increase in width during the period of excess sand supply would have been a gradual process involving relatively small amounts of extra sand in any one year. </p><p>"This is a process that slowly built up beach width over a period of perhaps 50 to 75 years, and I anticipate that the decrease in beach width will also not occur suddenly," he said.</p><p>Both Griggs and Weber agreed that understanding beach dynamics requires long-term observations because the system is so variable. "Most of our understanding of cliff erosion is based on observations that only span the last 30 to 50 years," Weber said.</p><p>By contrast, he based his hypothesis on historic maps going back to the time of the missions and photographic records from the past 75 years. And only time will tell if his interpretation is accurate. </p><p>"I'll probably be dead by the time we know if I'm right about this," he said.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Weber at (831) 469-7211 or jweber@earthsci.ucsc.edu and Griggs at (831) 459-5006 or griggs@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914fd1978072704601a012ffb8548b3d"><name>856</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>$1.8 million NSF grant funds UCSC prof's research on science learning in museums</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu </author><keywords>science, education, museum, aquaria, learning, ash, florida, technology</keywords><start-date>1113807600000</start-date><display-name>$1.8 million NSF grant...</display-name><path>/2005/04/856</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/04/856</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338181473</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338181473</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For many parents, taking the kids to the aquarium or a hands-on science museum combines fun and learning.</p>
<p>Like parents, education researcher Doris Ash sees facilities like the Exploratorium, Seymour Marine Discovery Center, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium as pathways that help all cross sections of the community learn about science while having a good time.</p>
<p>"Museums make science accessible and engaging," said Ash, an assistant professor of education at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Visitors sometimes don't recognize they're 'doing science,' but they are."</p>
<p>Called "informal science education," the learning that takes place at aquaria, zoos, and natural history museums enriches classroom learning and engages people in ways that schools sometimes can't. Such venues have become laboratories for Ash and other researchers eager to gauge the impact of museums on the learning process.</p>
<p>Ash recently received a $1.8 million grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct a five-year study of informal science education with Judith Lombana, vice president of research and institutional development at the Museum of Science &amp; Industry (MOSI) in Tampa, Florida.</p>
<p>"One hundred years ago, natural history museums were where the public learned most of what they knew about the natural world and conservation," said Ash. "There's value in looking at real objects and living things. It enhances the quality of learning in ways we don't even understand."</p>
<p>Ash, a trained biologist and former classroom teacher, is impressed by the scientific reasoning that takes place in museums. "People start asking questions, observing features, comparing and categorizing what they see, and they make connections," said Ash, who is especially interested in the impact of informal science learning on "nontraditional" visitors, including the poor and those with limited or no English skills.</p>
<p>"Families who can't read the display materials because they don't speak English are still very engaged in making sense of what they're seeing," she added. "The life sciences are so profound, and we all know something about them. In the absence of more specific knowledge, parents enter the conversation and families work together to bring meaning to the experience."</p>
<p>Cognitive and developmental psychologists have determined that even young children can make connections about living things, noting for example that they grow and reproduce. Less is known about when and how people grasp notions of form and function, which are other ways of reasoning about living things, she said.</p>
<p>At MOSI, Ash's team will videotape families to document and later analyze the interactions that occur among people with different levels of knowledge. Ultimately, her insights into the learning process could help museum educators improve their services and reveal successful strategies that could be carried over into classrooms.</p>
<p>Ash has researched informal science learning at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. She is a member of UCSC's Informal Learning Group, which has extensive expertise working with bilingual and English-speaking families in informal settings. MOSI is at the forefront of museum efforts to enhance educator training and museum programs by participating in research projects with practical applications.</p>
