"It shows that you can teach serious science in unexpected places," said Bridgeman, who has published a scholarly article that explains the perceptual effects at work at the Mystery Spot. His article, "Influence of Visually Induced Expectation on Perceived Motor Effort: A Visual-Proprioceptive Interaction at the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot," appears in the current issue of <i><a href="http://www.psychonomic.org/PBR/contents.htm">Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</a></i>.</p><p>Mystery Spot visitors will recognize the scene of Bridgeman's research: In a cabin on a steep hillside, an 8 kg. weight hangs on a chain from the ceiling. Although the weight hangs vertically, the tilt of the cabin makes the weight appear to be suspended at an angle. Visitors find that pushing the weight one way is perceived as much more difficult than pushing it the other way. Rather than a magical defiance of gravity, the explanation lies in the "mismatch" between expectations and the actual weight: Expectations based on visual information override the proprioceptive experience of moving the weight. (Often referred to as the sixth sense, proprioception is an unconscious aspect of the sensory system that provides information essential to movement.)</p><p>Far from spoiling the fun, Bridgeman said understanding the phenomenon adds to the enjoyment of a visit to the Mystery Spot. "To me, it's much more fun to have something that's real than not," said Bridgeman. "The real fun is that you can learn about how your mind works in an interesting setting." Mystery Spot managers welcomed the experiment, he added.</p><p>In the study, seven subjects pushed the pendulum away from vertical in both directions and were asked to judge the required effort on a 1 - 10 scale, with 1 described as "effortless" and 10 "immovable." All participants experienced the "effort illusion": perceived effort in pushing toward visual vertical was significantly greater than perceived effort in pushing away from visual vertical. </p><p>"The tilt of the cabin makes it appear that the pendulum is suspended in an impossible position," said Bridgeman. "It is as though some additional force holds the weight in this unstable position. That's why the visual illusion is so compelling, and why the expected force applied is so dramatically different from the actual force needed to move the weight." Pushing the weight toward what appears to be vertical will always require more force than expected, and pushing it away will always require less.</p><p>"The visual context strongly influences what you perceive, and you can't escape it, even if you know better," said Bridgeman. "Expectations and assumptions are as important to perceived weight as the actual effort required to move objects."</p><p>And what does the professor hope students take away from their visit to the Mystery Spot? </p><p>"We think of our perceptions as being pretty much accurate, but they seldom are," said Bridgeman, noting that people are notoriously inaccurate when they attempt to estimate things like distance and the slope of a hill, too. "The philosophy of the brain is not to be totally accurate but to reduce the chance of error. Perception in the service of action is error reduction." </p><p>In other words, he said, "We're wrong, but we're right enough to get us there."</p><p> </p><p>#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f2a028072704601a012ffb4a8e1a8"><name>752</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>ARCS Foundation scholarships support nine outstanding graduate students at UCSC</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>ARCS, scholarships</keywords><start-date>1128495600000</start-date><display-name>ARCS Foundation scholarships support...</display-name><path>/2005/10/752</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/752</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338138573</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338138573</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Nine UC Santa Cruz graduate students have received scholarships worth a total of $100,000 from the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation for the 2005-06 academic year.

Miller has resigned as director of the University of California Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), a position he held for 14 years. Miller will return to full-time teaching and research at UC Santa Cruz, where he is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics.</p><p>Michael Bolte, also a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, will serve as interim director of UCO/Lick while an international search is under way to appoint a new permanent director. </p><p>UCO/Lick, headquartered on the UCSC campus, operates the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton and is a managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Lick Observatory, founded in 1888, was the first major mountaintop observatory and continues to be an important research site. </p><p>When Miller became director of UCO/Lick in 1991, the Keck Observatory was just a contruction project and Lick was the only UC observatory. By 1993, the 10-meter Keck I Telescope was operational, and in 1996 it was joined by the twin Keck II Telescope. They remain the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, and they have enabled the research of UC astronomers to flourish at an unprecedented level. </p><p>"It has been a very eventful time," Miller said. "This job would have been impossible without the tremendous support of the excellent scientists and technical staff who make this one of the premier observatories in the world."</p><p>UCO/Lick astronomers are now working with partner institutions on plans for a giant 30-meter telescope. The Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) project is currently in the design phase, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through separate $17.5 million grants to UC and the California Institute of Technology. </p><p>"In his first ten years as director, Joe Miller led UC astronomy into the Keck Observatory era and to the very forefront of astronomical research. In the last four years, his vision for the future has been to have UC play a leadership role in designing, building, and using the first of the next generation of extremely large telescopes. The Thirty-Meter Telescope is the realization of that vision, and this project is progressing rapidly on all design fronts," said Bolte, who cochairs the TMT science advisory committee.</p><p>UCO/Lick has been in the forefront of developments in adaptive optics, the revolutionary technology for removing the blurring effects of the atmosphere from astronomical images. The world's first laser guide star for routine adaptive optics observations was implemented on the 3-meter Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory.</p><p>In 1999, UCO/Lick astronomers led the successful effort to establish the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center headquartered at UCSC. And in 2002, a $9 million grant from the Moore Foundation enabled UCO/Lick to establish the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics at UCSC. </p><p>Also during Miller's tenure, three major instruments for the Keck Telescopes were designed and built at the UCO/Lick Technical Laboratories at UCSC: the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), the Echelle Spectrometer and Imager (ESI), and the Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS).</p><p>"These instruments have led to many important discoveries," Miller said. "They are arguably as successful as any instruments on any large telescope in the world."</p><p>Miller, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1967, holds the Henry Bachmann Endowed Chair for Astronomical Instrumentation. His research interests include quasars and active galactic nuclei, focusing on their relationships with the surrounding environment and the nature of their host galaxies. </p><p>Miller was named director of UCO/Lick in 1991. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994 and served as chair of the AURA Coordinating Council of Observatory Research Directors from 1997 to 1999. He earned his B.A. in astronomy and physics from UCLA and his M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Wisconsin.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f2cd68072704601a012ff07f21f1d"><name>754</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>International economists gather at UCSC Oct. 14-15 for annual conference</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>economics, international, SCCIE, conference</keywords><start-date>1128582000000</start-date><display-name>International economists gather at...</display-name><path>/2005/10/754</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/754</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338139268</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338139268</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For Immediate Release</p><p>SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Eighth Annual International Economics Conference will take place October 14-15 at the University Center at UC Santa Cruz.

DÃ­a de los Muertos ("Day of the Dead") is celebrated throughout Mexico on the Christian holy days of All Saints Day and All Souls Day (November 1 and 2). The annual celebration is believed to have begun several thousand years ago.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The centerpiece of the October 25 event in Santa Cruz will be a "community altar" created by local elementary schoolchildren and Jamie Abbott's sculpture students from Cabrillo College. Members of a DÃ­a de los Muertos art class at UCSC and the campus's Chicano Latino Resource Center also contributed to the project.</p>
<p>Attendees are encouraged to bring photographs or other mementos to place on the altar as an <em>ofrenda</em> ("offering"). Tamales, beverages, and other refreshments will be served following the ceremony.</p>
<p>Poetry, music, and dance performances directed by UC Santa Cruz theater arts professor Alma Martinez and theater arts lecturer Rosa Apodaca will be featured. Artists include the UCSC student group Los Babosos, which will perform mariachi music.</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton will be the guest of honor, as the activity is one of a series of community events that the campus is organizing around her investiture on November 4 as UCSC's ninth chancellor.</p>
<p>Admission to the event is free, and shuttle service to the event will be provided from UCSC's Bay Tree Bookstore, beginning at 6 p.m.</p>

The initiative is the work of Campus CURB (Community United to Reduce Bingeing), a newly formed coalition of UC Santa Cruz administrators, students, UCSC and Santa Cruz police, and community leaders. The theme of Campus CURB's fall initiative will be "UCSC Students Just Say Gnome: Party Small!"</p><p><b>When:</b> 11 a.m., Thursday, October 6.</p><p><b>Where:</b> Conference Room, Cowell Student Health Center, UC Santa Cruz.</p><p><b>Press conference details:</b> UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton and other campus administrators, including University Health Services director Leslie Elkind and UCSC Police chief Mickey Aluffi, will be joined by community representatives, including Mike Rotkin, Santa Cruz mayor; Patty Sapone, deputy chief of administration for the Santa Cruz Police Department; and June Coha, of West Side Neighbors. </p><p><b>Background:</b> Campus CURB's initiative will address the issue on several levels. An educational campaign will show students and others how to host safe parties and examine their responsibility for the safety of their guests and neighbors. There will also be publicity about police enforcement of existing laws that protect the community from alcohol-related harm, including DUI enforcement, party patrols to disperse unruly crowds, and enforcing laws prohibiting alcohol sales to minors. In addition, the city's newly revised "party" ordinance that imposes fines on those who repeatedly require community or police response will be utilized as a tool to curb excessive drinking.</p><p>Data collected as part of the Safer California Universities study by the Prevention Research Center indicate many student-drinking problems at UC Santa Cruz are generated at community parties surrounding the campus. Poorly controlled parties disrupt neighborhoods and can lead to student injuries or assaults.</p><p>If you plan to attend: Please contact Louise Donahue in UCSC's Public Information Office </p><p>(831/459-5312) about special parking designated for reporters covering the press conference.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f36268072704601a012ffa3af2a81"><name>759</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fisheries management study focuses on small-scale fishing cooperatives in the Gulf of California</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Fisheries, PISCO</keywords><start-date>1129100400000</start-date><display-name>Fisheries management study focuses...</display-name><path>/2005/10/759</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/759</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338141656</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338141656</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has awarded a major grant to researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and other institutions to study fisheries in the northern Gulf of California. The $1.3 million grant funds a collaborative project to help local Mexican fishers and government officials understand and manage marine resources using cutting-edge fisheries science.</p><p>The project is an interdisciplinary effort that will combine social science, fisheries science, and outreach programs to promote the sustainability of fisheries in the Gulf of California. Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology, will lead UCSC's participation in the project, along with Giacomo Bernardi and Mark Carr, both associate professors of ecology and evolutionary biology. The project also involves researchers at the University of Arizona and three Mexican institutions. </p><p>Local fishers will play a pivotal role in the project by providing historical and anecdotal information, providing samples for scientific analysis, and participating in habitat surveys, Raimondi said.</p><p>The Gulf of California, between the Baja peninsula and the Mexican mainland, is a remarkably rich environment. It provides vital habitat for marine mammals, seabirds, fish, and shellfish, some of which are found nowhere else in the world. It also provides a livelihood for many of the people who live along its shores. </p><p>Local fishers, who rely on the marine resources for sustenance and income, have been hard hit by declining catches. In recent years, the Gulf of California has been plagued by overfishing and reduced freshwater flow due to diversion of the Colorado River. Many local fishers are in favor of marine reserves, restricted fishing seasons, and other measures to sustain their fisheries. </p><p>"The attitude of the local Mexican fishers in the northern Gulf of California is very different from what you see in the United States, where many fishers resist these kinds of management strategies, especially reserves," Raimondi said. </p><p>The local fishing industry in the northern Gulf of California is characterized by the "panga," a small open boat used by most small-scale fishers. In many cases, fishers from a single town or several small villages have formed cooperatives to protect their interests. These cooperatives are often territorial and discourage encroachment from nearby communities and larger commercial boats.</p><p>Although local stewardship has been effective in some situations, there is no guarantee that it will work in the Gulf of California. For each type of fish or shellfish, effective management will depend on its breeding and migration habits and on local ocean currents, Raimondi said. The "PANGAS project," as it is informally known, aims to answer questions that will help local fishers and the Mexican government manage resources effectively. For example, can the locally organized fishing cooperatives hope to regulate the fisheries they rely upon, or does management need to be regional? If cooperatives protect local breeding stocks by establishing reserves, will they reap the benefits of this protection, or will the young fish go somewhere else and enrich the fisheries of their neighbors?  </p><p>"We want to be able to look at each species and tell fishers what type of management will be most effective," Raimondi said.</p><p>In order to answer these questions, UCSC researchers will collaborate with partner institutions to learn about the habits of commercially important fish and shellfish. In addition to the University of Arizona, partners include the Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada (CICESE), Communidad y Biodiversidad (COBI) in Bahia Kino, and Centro Intercultural para el Estudio de los Desiertos y Océanos (CEDO) in Puerto Peñasco. </p><p>For many of the questions addressed, the researchers will use techniques similar to those used by Raimondi, Carr, and their colleagues in a long-term monitoring project on the U.S. West Coast known as the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO). Ocean current data will help scientists predict where free-floating larvae will end up when they finally settle down and transition to the juvenile phase. Other techniques will provide more direct data on local fish and shellfish populations. </p><p>Population genetics, for example, uses DNA to assess the degree of similarity between individuals of the same species. If all the mussels on one part of the coast share a sequence of DNA but mussels on a nearby section of coast do not have this sequence, researchers can conclude that the two populations are separate and usually do not interbreed. Unfortunately, the results are rarely this clear. </p><p>"Even one or two migrants per generation can scramble genes to the extent that there is no detectable difference between populations," Raimondi said. </p><p>More promising for the study of local populations may be an environmental sleuthing technique known as otolith microchemistry that allows scientists to look back at the migration history of an individual fish. Fish have small ear bones known as otoliths. Every day that a fish lives, it deposits a thin layer of calcium on the otolith (like the rings of a tree). The signature of the water in which the fish is living is incorporated in the calcium deposit. This signature is made up of trace elements that are present in the water (often contaminants such as lead, selenium, and barium). </p><p>In studies along the California coast, PISCO scientists have shown that the trace elements provide a fingerprint that is unique to a small part of the coast. From otoliths, scientists can determine the age of the fish and where the fish was when each layer of calcium was laid down, Raimondi said.</p><p>In the case of the PANGAS project, scientists will use the central (oldest) part of the otoliths to determine where a fish lived as a juvenile. If most of the fish caught by fishers in the cooperative were spawned and grew up nearby, then local management will likely be effective in protecting this population. If fish caught in one area began their lives widely scattered along the coast, however, a more regional approach to management will be needed to protect the fishery.</p><p>For the PANGAS project, scientists from UCSC will primarily work with CICESE to collect the scientific data for the project and to conduct outreach programs to train Mexican participants in the use of scientific techniques for fisheries management. The University of Arizona will work in partnership with the two other Mexican groups to collect social information about the nature and organization of the cooperatives and the history of the fisheries. Both groups will involve the local fishers extensively in their research. </p><p>The grant for the PANGAS project is part of a broader effort by the Packard Foundation to conserve marine richness and productivity and to contribute to the sustainability of marine and coastal economies.</p><p>The ongoing PISCO project is a partnership of four major universities (including UCSC) dedicated to studying the nearshore ecosystems of the U.S. West Coast from southern California to Oregon (see <a href="http://www.piscoweb.org">http://www.piscoweb.org</a>). The Packard Foundation funded the first six years of the PISCO project with $24 million in grants, and has now partnered with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to provide an additional $24.5 million over the next five years ($13.5 million from the Moore Foundation and $11 million from the Packard Foundation, of which about $7 million will go to UCSC).</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Peter Raimondi at (831) 459-5674 or raimondi@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f37b48072704601a012ff707d84e8"><name>761</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture to feature 50th anniversary screening of honored film</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1129100400000</start-date><display-name>Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture...</display-name><path>/2005/10/761</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/761</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338142081</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338142081</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sharmila Tagore, one of India's most famous film stars, and Indian art historian Dr. Partha Mitter will be the featured speakers at the fifth annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture set for Sunday, October 23 at 4 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p><table align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="9" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td width="5"></td><td BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><b><font color="#333333">See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/download/maitra05.jpg">poster</a> of event.</font></b></td></tr></table>The event will also feature the 50th anniversary screening of a restored print of Indian film director Satyajit Ray's trailblazing first film, Pather Panchali, which kicked off the "Classics" series at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The series focused this year on the preservation mission of the Film Foundation established in New York by Martin Scorsese with Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, Steven Spielberg, Robert Altman, and Clint Eastwood. Ray's Pather Panchali and Jean Renoir's The River were the two films chosen to represent the mission of the foundation which is to restore and preserve works "to assure the future of the cinema of the past."</p><p>The restoration of Ray's film was spearhead by Dilip Basu, director of the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection (RayFASC)-an archive on the UC Santa Cruz campus that hosts 31 of Ray's 36 films and more than 7,000 journals, scrapbooks, posters, stills, books, records and other memorabilia. The films are restored, and housed in climate-controlled vaults, at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles.</p><p>The Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture--presented by RayFASC--was established in 2001 by Anuradha Luther Maitra in honor of her husband, who was a scientist, entrepreneur, and admirer of the late Indian film director's work. Ray FASC was founded in 1993 to acquire, preserve, and provide scholarly access to Ray's films, papers, books, and artwork.</p><p>This year's event will begin at 4 p.m. with a short documentary directed by Basu on Ray's Apu Trilogy: Pather Panchali (1955), Aparajito (1956) and Apu Sansar (1959)-which traces the life of a Bengali family and their son Apu, and which made Satyajit Ray India's first internationally recognized director. Professor of art history Partha Mitter will then speak on "The Poetic Reality of Satyajit Ray," followed by actress Sharmila Tagore, who will give a personal perspective about her experiences working with Ray. The restored print of Pather Panchali will be screened at 5 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public.</p><p>Basu noted that the UC Santa Cruz event will culminate a yearlong celebration of the 50th anniversary of Ray's first film.</p><p>"We opened our anniversary celebration last December by taking author Salmon Rushdie to  Calcutta, where we had an exhibition of Ray's film art and a lecture by Rushdie," said Basu. "Then in May, we were invited by the Cannes Film Festival to be an official part of this year's program and launch their 'Classics' series."</p><p>Two-time Oscar-winning director and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences, Frank Pierson, accompanied Basu to the Cannes Festival, along with actress Tagore, whose film career began with Ray at the age of 14. She acted in five of his films, and has gone on to star in more than 150 movies in the Indian film industry known as Bollywood.</p><p>"The restored print of Pather Panchali screened this past year in such places such as London, Germany Rome, New Delhi, Bangladesh, and Korea," Basu added. "We are now concluding our yearlong celebration by showing it on campus at UC Santa Cruz as part of this year's Sidhartha Maitra annual lecture and screening."</p><p>For more information, call (831) 459-4012 or visit satyajitray.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f38fa8072704601a012ff6270bd45"><name>762</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scholar/performer tapped to lead UCSC programs in North Indian classical music</title><author>Contact:  Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1129100400000</start-date><display-name>Scholar/performer tapped to lead...</display-name><path>/2005/10/762</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/762</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338142407</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338142407</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dard Neuman has ambitious plans for promoting Indian music and culture at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>As holder of the university's Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair in Classical Indian Music, he is responsible for building interest in Hindustani music through a variety of programs--functioning as a combination of academic instructor, concert promoter, event coordinator, sitar teacher, fundraiser, and program manager.</p><p>A 2004 Ph.D. from Columbia University specializing in North Indian Classical music, Neuman is also trained as a sitarist. As a dedicated musician, anthropologist, and ethnomusicologist, Neuman will work to broaden UCSC's offerings in world music as he provides critical direction for programs and courses funded by the campus's Indian music endowments.</p><p>"We are delighted that Dard Neuman has joined us in our efforts to further the study and performance of the Indian arts at UC Santa Cruz," said Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "As our first endowed chair in Indian classical music, his appointment is a critical component of our long-range plans to create a flourishing center of South Asia studies on campus."</p><p>Neuman noted that the UC Santa Cruz endowed chair in Indian music may be the first of its kind for an American university. "To have a chaired position that was created solely for Hindustani music is unique in the United States," said Neuman. "I believe that UC Santa Cruz had the very first one."</p><p>The 33-year-old Neuman comes from a long musical lineage. His father is also a musician and ethnomusicologist who has studied the anthropology of Indian music. His mother was born in India to a family of music lovers, and his aunt is a professional sitarist. Neuman was presented with a small sitar on his fifth birthday in India, and he soon began studying with his aunt.</p><p>"I come from a background where music saturated the air," Neuman observed. "I had constant exposure to visiting artists. My grandparents were close to musicians who often played at our house when they came through town. And when my father was at Dartmouth and at the University of Washington, he would invite visiting artists and they would often stay at our place. So I couldn't help becoming obsessed with the music--either you rebel and have nothing to do with it, or it becomes part of your blood, your passion."</p><p>Neuman has many ideas to help build the Indian music program at UCSC over the next decade. In an effort to expose students and the community to a wider range of traditional music styles, instruments, and vocal techniques, he plans to create a revolving visiting artist course to bring different musicians from India to teach at UCSC.</p><p>He will also continue UCSC's Indian concert series and hopes to present an Indian music festival--modeled after the two or three-day festivals in India that run all day and all night long. "In Hindustani music, there are ragas for different times of the day," Neuman noted. "And since most concerts take place in the evening we seldom hear the late or early morning ragas."</p><p>In addition to bringing in scholars from around the world for academic conferences, Neuman also hopes to establish an archive of Indian music at UCSC. "There is a substantial collection of concert recordings dating from the 1950s and commercial recordings dating from the turn of the century," said Neuman. "An archive at UCSC would allow people to listen to a wide selection of archived music, interviews, and field recordings."</p><p>Neuman added he would like to create a CD series where both musicians and ethnomusicologists can reflect on what's happening in selected musical recordings. He additionally envisions creating videos of renowned musicians reacting to old recordings and talking about them as a way for students to have historical material come alive. And topping his wish list, as UCSC expands its programs, is to eventually produce an equivalent for Indian music of the Ken Burns documentary on jazz.</p><p>"It's quite exciting," said Neuman, as he described plans for the beginning sitar course he is teaching this fall quarter. "My ultimate goal is for UC Santa Cruz to become a center for Indian scholastic and performance activity in the U.S."</p><p>                                 </p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f3a298072704601a012ff1982dcfc"><name>763</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Women's Center to celebrate 20th anniversary</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1129186800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Women's Center to...</display-name><path>/2005/10/763</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/763</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338142709</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338142709</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Women's Center will observe its 20th anniversary with a celebratory luncheon, a new publication from the Regional History Project of the University Library, and an art exhibit by UCSC women staff and alumnae. </p><p>The luncheon will take place from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m on Saturday, October 22, at the Women's Center, located at Cardiff House on the UCSC campus. Featured speakers include Santa Cruz County supervisor Mardi Wormhoudt and UCSC psychology professor Aida Hurtado, who will both speak on the topic: "Why a Women's Center?"-Wormhoudt from a town/gown perspective and Hurtado from an academic point of view. UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton will provide the opening remarks. This event is free and open to the community. For reservations, contact Roberta Valdez at (831) 459-2169.</p><p>The Women's Center will also celebrate the publication of Crossing Borders: The UCSC Women's Center, 1985-2005, a new oral history from the Regional History Project of the UCSC Library. Conceived of and completed especially for this anniversary, the new volume features seven interviews with narrators who address the vision, achievements, and challenges faced by the Women's Center over the past two decades. Two of the center's founding faculty-UCSC literature professor Helene Moglen and American studies/women's studies lecturer emerita Marge Frantz--as well as five staff women who served as directors, are featured in the publication, including Kathie Olsen, Beatriz Lopez-Flores, Arlyn Osborne, Shane Snowdon, and Roberta Valdez. </p><p>"The UCSC Women's Center was founded with a broad vision far beyond that of most academic women's centers," noted Irene Reti, director of the Regional History Project. "It has served not only students, but also staff and faculty, as well as the surrounding community."</p><p>The Women's Center will also celebrate its anniversary with an art exhibit titled Legacies, running through October 28 at the Cardiff House. The show will feature photographs, paintings, sculpture, and surface design created by UCSC staff and alumnae. </p><p>Copies of the oral history may be ordered from the Regional History Project by calling (831) 459-2847 or e-mailing ihreti@ucsc.edu. The oral history is also available online at http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html or in the University Library's collection. </p><p>For more information, call (831) 459-2169 or go to the Women's Center web site at: http://www2.ucsc.edu/wmcenter/. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f3b768072704601a012ffccc3594a"><name>764</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Public forum on education and state funding at UCSC October 25&#13;

The book is packed with valuable tips on how to become a better birder, as well as interesting stories and information about birds, but its real subject is the experience of being a birder. </p><p>In 50 short essays, Newberry addresses topics ranging from the practical (aiming binoculars) to the philosophical (do seagulls play?). Illustrated with delightful drawings by Gene Holtan, the essays are elegant and insightful meditations on the challenges and rewards of birdwatching. </p><p>Newberry is a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He focused on marine invertebrates as a researcher, but birding has been his lifelong avocation. A popular and influential teacher at UCSC (he won the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1987), Newberry retired in 1994 but has found that birding continues to provide new opportunities to teach. </p><p>In his biology classes, Newberry said, he tried to teach students how to become "investigative reporters of nature." Birders can do that, too, and Newberry explains in <i>The Ardent Birder</i> how to move beyond asking the basic question of "Who are you?" when observing birds in the field. One of the most entertaining and instructive essays in the book involves an imagined "interview" with some godwits on a mudflat. The exercise gives a hint of Newberry's own remarkable skills as an investigative reporter of nature.</p><p>Newberry said he set out to write a book for intermediate birders, because there seemed to be good books already available for beginners and advanced birders. He calls advanced birders the "varsity" (professionals are "major leaguers"), and at one point the book was about how to join the varsity. But in the end, Newberry produced a book that will appeal to all ardent birders regardless of their skills, and even nonbirders are likely to enjoy many of the essays.</p><p>What makes someone an ardent birder? Newberry explains it in terms of an emotional attachment to nature that comes from experiencing those special moments when, as he puts it, "lightning strikes." For Newberry, lightning struck for the first time when he was a boy in boarding school and a meadowlark shot up from the ground at his feet. Those moments of exhilaration and awe are essential to understanding why birders pursue their avian obsession with such passion. </p><p>"The thing that bonds us are those special moments. It's a private thing, but I think it's something we all share," he said.</p><p>Since his retirement, Newberry has taught occasional courses on birds at UCSC. He also leads outings of the local bird club and will be guiding visitors during the first annual Monterey Bay Birding Festival in November. (For more information, visit the festival web site at <a href="http://www.montereybaybirding.org/">http://www.montereybaybirding.org</a>.) </p><p>The Monterey Bay region is one of the great birding hot spots of North America. "People come from all over to go birding here," Newberry said. </p><p>But wherever they may go, birders of all kinds are sure to find pleasure and inspiration in <i>The Ardent Birder.</i></p><p>Newberry's writing has appeared in <i>Omnivore, The Antioch Review, The North American Review,</i> and <i>Three Penny Review.</i> He came to UCSC as a founding faculty member when the campus opened in 1965. He earned a B.A. in biology from Princeton University and a Ph.D. in biology from Stanford University. </p><p>The artist Gene Holtan has devoted a long life to the visual arts, painting and drawing in a range of media including paper, canvas, pottery, and children's books. After many years in Santa Cruz, he now lives in Oakland. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Notes to reporters:</b> You may contact Newberry at taxa@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p>For review copies of <i>The Ardent Birder,</i> contact Tim Stephens in the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-4352 or stephens@ucsc.edu; or contact Ten Speed Press at (510) 559-1600 or publicity@tenspeed.com.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f3de38072704601a012ff22a06a6a"><name>766</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC completes Draft EIR related to update of campus's Long-Range Development Plan</title><author>Jim Burns, 831/459-2495</author><start-date>1129618800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC completes Draft EIR...</display-name><path>/2005/10/766</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/766</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338143670</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338143670</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has completed work on a Draft Environmental Impact Report that assesses potential impacts related to the implementation of UCSC's Draft 2005 Long-Range Development Plan.

The release of the Draft EIR today (Tuesday, October 18) begins a 60-day period in which people can submit comments on the document's adequacy. The comments-and UCSC's response to them-will be incorporated into the LRDP's Final EIR. Both the Final EIR and the 2005 LRDP will be submitted to UC's Board of Regents for consideration, probably next summer.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The completion of the Draft EIR is the latest step in the campus's three-year effort to update its Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP). Five public workshops were held before the Draft 2005 LRDP was completed and released this past January; following the release of the Draft LRDP, UCSC hosted three "scoping" meetings to receive input from public agencies and individuals on the scope of issues to be considered in the Draft EIR.</p>
<p>"We believe that this Draft EIR provides a thorough examination of the environmental impacts associated with implementing our updated LRDP-and includes a number of measures for reducing or eliminating identified impacts," said campus architect Frank Zwart, associate vice chancellor for UCSC's Office of Physical Planning and Construction. "But just as we welcomed public participation when we were preparing the Draft 2005 LRDP, we encourage public participation during the important comment period for this Draft EIR."</p>
<p><strong>The Draft EIR is available off campus at:</strong></p>
<p>. Santa Cruz Central Library (224 Church Street), for free on-site review.</p>
<p>. Santa Cruz Fed-Ex Kinko's (105 Laurel Street), for purchase of personal CD or printout.</p>
<p><strong>The Draft EIR is available on campus at:</strong></p>
<p>. McHenry Library and the Science &amp; Engineering Library, for free on-site review.</p>
<p>. UCSC XpressIt!-Business &amp; Creative Solutions, for purchase of computer CD or printout.</p>
<p>In addition, UCSC has posted the Draft EIR online (at <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu">http://lrdp.ucsc.edu</a>) as a convenience for people who have the ability to access the document through a personal computer. (The dependability of on-line access is influenced by a number of factors, including the speed of a computer's Internet connection and the availability of up-to-date web browser and PDF software.)</p>
<p><strong>People who wish to submit a comment on the adequacy of the Draft EIR may do so orally and/or in writing at public hearings that have been scheduled on the draft document. The two hearings will take place on:</strong></p>
<p>. Wednesday, November 16, 2005</p>
<p>7 to 10 p.m., at University Inn &amp; Conference Center</p>
<p>611 Ocean Street in Santa Cruz</p>
<p>. Wednesday, November 30, 2005</p>
<p>3 to 6 p.m., at the Stevenson College Events Center (formerly Stevenson Dining Hall)</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz campus</p>
<p><strong>Written comments on the Draft EIR may also be e-mailed, mailed, or hand-delivered to UCSC anytime before the document's comment period ends at 5 p.m. on December 19, 2005.</strong></p>

<p>Within the University of California system, LRDPs are drafted to support the academic goals of individual campuses; they also take into account projected statewide enrollment demand. Upon their completion, the long-range plans define a building program and a land-use map that serve as a planning framework for capital construction, infrastructure, and land-use programs. LRDPs, however, are not implementation plans, and adoption of an LRDP does not constitute a commitment to specific projects, construction schedules, or funding priorities.</p>
<p>The three-year process that began in fall 2003 will produce UCSC's fifth Long-Range Development Plan, following plans that were adopted in 1963 (two years before the campus opened), 1971, 1978, and 1989.</p>

His findings appear in the October issue of the Economics of Education Review. </p><p>"The digital divide is large and persistent, and black and Latino children are particularly hard-hit," said Fairlie. "The digital divide has important implications for educational and economic inequality in the United States. These findings should be a wake-up call for policy makers."</p><p>Although many studies have explored the impact of computers in schools, and the federal government has made computer access in schools a priority, very few studies have assessed the impact on youth of having a computer in the home.

Teenagers who have access to home computers are 6 to 8 percentage points more likely to graduate from high school than teens who lack access to a home computer, after controlling for individual, parental, and family characteristics.</p><p>. Only 50.6 percent of blacks and 48.7 percent of Latinos have access to home computers, compared to 74.6 percent of whites. </p><p>. Only 40.5 percent of blacks and 38.1 percent of Latinos have Internet access at home, compared to 67.3 percent of whites.</p><p>. Among children, slightly more than half of all black and Latino children have access to a home computer, and about 40 percent have Internet access at home. By comparison, 85.5 percent of white children have home computer access, and 77.4 percent can use the Internet at home.</p><p>. Asians have home computer and Internet access rates that are slightly higher than white rates (77.7 and 70.3 percent, compared to 74.6 and 67.3 percent).</p><p>. Among Latinos, Mexicans have the lowest home computer and Internet access rates, followed by Central and South Americans.</p><p>Racial disparities in access to computer technology--the so-called digital divide--are ignored in the latest Department of Commerce reports, entitled A Nation Online. </p><p>"We are clearly not all a 'nation online'," said Fairlie. "Twenty million children in the United States, or 26 percent of children, have no computer access at home, and race is a key part of who's online and who isn't." </p><p>In previous work, Fairlie has found that racial disparities in access to computers at home are highest among the age group 8-25. "These patterns are particularly troubling in light of the presumption that information technology is a new prerequisite for success in the labor market," said Fairlie, a labor economist who specializes in minority entrepreneurship. His research is funded by the W. T. Grant Foundation and the Community Technology Foundation of California.                                  </p><p>During a recent trip to Washington, D.C., Fairlie presented his report, "Are We Really a Nation Online? Ethnic and Racial Disparities in Access to Technology and Their Consequences," to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and participated in a Congressional briefing on the digital divide.</p><p>#####</p><p>Note to Journalists: Fairlie may be reached at (831) 459-3332 or via e-mail at rfairlie@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f408b8072704601a012ffde465e7a"><name>768</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gas leak causes Hahn evacuation; building open for business first thing Thursday</title><author>Jim Burns (831/459-2495)</author><start-date>1129705200000</start-date><display-name>Gas leak causes Hahn...</display-name><path>/2005/10/768</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/768</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338144350</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338144350</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jim Burns</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>jrburns@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A leak of natural gas prompted UCSC fire officials on Wednesday to evacuate staff from the Hahn Student Services Building. Approximately 80 people left the building at 3:15 in the afternoon. The building was declared safe to reoccupy about an hour later.</p>
<p>The leak was related to work being done outside the building in an area where an emergency generator is under construction.</p>
<p>While the building is now safe to occupy and will be open for business first thing on Thursday, heat and hot water will not be restored to the building immediately.</p>
<p>The evacuation involved fewer people than normally would have been the case, as the building is undergoing seismic retrofit construction during this academic year. That project required that the second floor be vacated earlier this year, leaving only first-floor occupants to exit during Wednesday's evacuation.</p>
<p>UCSC fire, environmental health &amp; safety, and physical plant crews were on the scene at Hahn on Wednesday.</p>

What's unusual is that she was born November 9. Better yet, when Martin sits down to Thanksgiving dinner, a rose-based bouquet often adorns his table.</p>
<p>Impossible, you say? Not so, replies Martin, manager of the celebrated Alan Chadwick Garden at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Roses require a little bit of attention every day, and for that, they'll reward you with a spectacular bloom in April, a mini-spring in August and September, and blossoms into November and December, depending on the weather," said Martin.</p>
<p>After years of perfecting the art of organic rose care, Martin shares his expertise with the rest of us in the new book, <em>A Rose Primer: An Organic Approach to Rose Selection and Care</em> (Santa Cruz, CA: Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden and the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems).</p>
<p>The book spells out the steps to success in a year-round guide to the care and feeding of organically grown roses, and includes Martin's tips regarding selection, sources, and planting, as well. Each section ends with a handy "In a Nutshell" summary for busy gardeners. Though focused on rose-growing on the Central Coast, the book is filled with principles that carry over to rose cultivation in other areas.</p>
<p>"People think of roses as requiring lots of chemicals, but really what they need is care. If you have five minutes a day, you can do it," said Martin. "Roses are resilient. With good care, you can turn them around in a matter of weeks during the growing season."</p>
<p>Success lies in a program of pruning, fertility, and disease control, according to Martin.</p>
<p>. Pruning--Winter pruning is performed during January's brief period of dormancy to stimulate growth. Counterintuitively, the more you prune, the more growth you'll get. Heavy pruning is followed by "fingerpruning" in February and March to control new growth and shape the plant.</p>
<p>. Fertility--Winter pruning should be followed with a liberal two-inch layer of organic compost, topped by an inch of mulch to control weeds and hold moisture.</p>
<p>. Disease control--Following the winter pruning, a light spray of dormant petroleum oil will combat insects and lime sulfur will reduce fungus. Using both produces a synergistic effect and requires one-third less product, noted Martin. "If you do nothing else with your roses, prune them hard in the winter and use these sprays in tandem," said Martin.</p>
<p>Other rose necessities include good drainage, regular water, and tidy surroundings. "Remove spent blooms and any diseased foliage promptly, and keep the soil at the base of your roses free of leaves, which are disease vectors," urged Martin. After the first bloom, apply more compost and a granular organic fertilizer, followed by a deep watering, and you'll be rewarded in a matter of weeks. "Roses are cyclical, with a four- to eight-week hiatus between blooms," said Martin. "When you cut a spent flower, it prompts the plant to create a new bud. As my grandmother always said, with roses, you've got to take to get."</p>

The investiture ceremony, expected to last less than an hour, will follow a two-day academic symposium that reflects Chancellor Denton's commitment to have the campus focus on academic priorities in lieu of a formal inauguration.<br/>
<br/>
<p>The "Achieving Excellence Through Diversity" symposium, beginning on Thursday, November 3, launches three days of investiture activities that also include the annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner on Saturday, November 5.</p>
<p>The first day of the symposium gets under way at 2:30 p.m. in UCSC's Media Theater. The symposium keynote speaker will be Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Preceding her talk, Jackson will be honored with the third UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal, an award recognizing individuals whose achievements illustrate the ideals and vision of UCSC. Following her talk, a discussion will take place on the best practices for enhancing diversity, access, and inclusion.</p>
<p>The symposium will continue on Friday, November 4, at 8:30 a.m. at UCSC's University Center. The second-day session, which ends at noon, will feature three "breakout sessions," including one in which President Dynes will preview a UC Faculty Diversity Study. The other two are titled: "What is diversity? Thinking at the edge" and "Teaching to a diverse student body."</p>
<p>The two-day symposium is expected to assist the campus in developing a plan for enhancing excellence. Both days of the symposium are free and open to the public, but online reservations are recommended.</p>
<p>Later on Friday, at the investiture in the Recital Hall, Dynes will present Chancellor Denton with the UC Santa Cruz Chancellor's Medallion. Chancellor Denton's inaugural address is titled "Excellence and Diversity: Leading in the 21st Century." George Marcus, vice chair of the UC Board of Regents, will represent the 10-campus University of California's governing body. Other participants include UCSC Academic Senate chair Faye Crosby and UCSC alumna Adilah Barnes. Overflow seating for the investiture will be available at the Media Theater, where a live audio/video feed will be transmitted. The investiture is also open to the public, but online reservations are required for both venues.</p>
<p>The "Celebration 2005" events, underscoring support for students as a theme of Chancellor Denton's administration, also include the Scholarships Benefit Dinner. The event raises badly needed funds for undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships.</p>
<p>The dinner, which was sold out by mid-October, will celebrate the success of the recently completed Cornerstone Campaign, which raised more than $67 million in private support. The event will also recognize Jack Baskin, a UCSC and Santa Cruz community benefactor; Baskin will receive the campus's first-ever Fiat Lux Award for his distinguished and sustained service to the university's programs and goals.</p>
<p>A number of regional events, held before and after the November 3-5 celebration, are also taking place-offering additional opportunities for the public to join in the investiture activities.</p>
<p>The six regional events began October 8, with a presentation on UCSC's New Teacher Center at a meeting of the Santa Cruz and Watsonville branches of the American Association of University Women. The last such event will take place on November 10, when So Percussion, one of the most exciting young ensembles in the country, performs at the Recital Hall as part of UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures program.</p>

But the future will bring a new threat--climate change--which could drastically reduce the areas in which oaks can grow. </p><p>Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have taken a close look at the implications of climate change for two familiar California oak species--blue oak and valley oak. Their findings will be published online this week in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> and will appear in the November 8 issue of the journal. </p><p>The researchers found that the areas of the state where the climate is suitable for these species to grow will shift northward and could shrink to nearly half their current size as a result of global warming. </p><p>"Species such as oaks that we think of as occurring throughout California and that are such a recognizable part of the landscape are vulnerable to climate change. It's not just the rare and endangered species that will be affected," said Lara Kueppers, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC and first author of the study. </p><p>The researchers used sophisticated climate models to project what California's climate may be like in the final decade of the 21st century, assuming a "business-as-usual" scenario for ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases. Based on those projections, they predicted the potential ranges for blue oak and valley oak under the new climatic conditions, and compared that with their ranges under current conditions.</p><p>Other researchers have used global climate models to study how the geographic areas where various species occur are likely to shift as a result of climate change. Even with powerful supercomputers, however, global climate models are limited in how much detail they can provide on a regional level. The UCSC researchers thought this would be a particular problem in California, with its complex geography and diverse ecosystems. So in addition to a global climate model, they also used a regional climate model for California that provides enough detail to distinguish major mountain ranges and valleys.  </p><p>As expected, the global and regional climate models gave different results, with the regional model indicating significantly smaller potential ranges in the future for the two oak species. The main reason for the difference is that the regional model shows stronger and more rapid warming at higher elevations, whereas the global model yields average results over large areas that blur the distinction between mountains and valleys within California. </p><p>The regional model yields a climate scenario in which the future range for blue oak shrinks to 59 percent of its current range, and for valley oak the future range shrinks to 54 percent of its current range. For both species, their potential habitat shifts northward, meaning that these species are not present in much of the area where climatic conditions will be right for them in the future.</p><p>"Suitable habitat is lost in the southern part of the state, and about a third of the new potential habitat is in areas where blue oaks do not currently grow. Most ecologists would not be comfortable assuming that the oaks will be able to get to those new areas," Kueppers said.</p><p>Lisa Sloan, professor of Earth sciences and a coauthor of the paper, said the shifting of ranges for oaks and other species poses a challenge for conservation planning. </p><p>"Our state parks and other protected areas are not set up to move with climate change," said Sloan, who directs UCSC's Climate Change and Impacts Laboratory where the climate model computations were carried out. </p><p>The other coauthors on the <i>PNAS</i> paper are postdoctoral researcher Mark Snyder; Erika Zavaleta, assistant professor of environmental studies; and Brian Fulfrost, coordinator of UCSC's Geographical Information Systems Laboratory.</p><p>Blue oak and valley oak do not occur naturally outside of California. Blue oak is found in the foothills of the Coast Ranges and the western Sierra Nevada, while valley oak grows on deeper soils along rivers and streams, particularly in the Central Valley. Both species are sensitive to temperature and rainfall. The changes in their potential ranges under the climate change scenario were attributable primarily to increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall during the growing season, Kueppers said.</p><p>"If this scenario is what we can expect with climate change, then these oak woodlands are going to have to adapt pretty dramatically to new conditions or move significant distances in a relatively short period of time," Kueppers said.</p><p>The study highlights the importance of studying climate change on a regional scale, because its effects will vary from one region to another, Sloan added. </p><p>"More intense hurricanes are the issue on the Gulf Coast, while melting sea ice is important in the Arctic," she said. "In California, the strongest effects of climate change are in the mountains, creating concern for our water supply and for the natural ecosystems that attract so many visitors."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Kueppers at (831) 459-3504 or kueppers@es.ucsc.edu and Sloan at (831) 459-3693 or lcsloan@earthsci.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27b85638072704601a012ffc915e6a1"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626258224</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626258224</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27b85638072704601a012ffc915e6a1"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/10/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626258224</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626258224</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
