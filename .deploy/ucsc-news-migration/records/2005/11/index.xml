The Institute for Scalable Scientific Data Management (ISSDM) will address looming issues of data storage and management for projects that involve large-scale simulation and computing.</p><p>"This new partnership builds on a history of fruitful scientific collaboration between UCSC faculty and students and Los Alamos scientists. The educational and research programs supported by the institute will benefit both partners while addressing major challenges in scientific computing," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton.</p><p>The institute will provide opportunities for UCSC graduate students to gain specialized experience and expertise in scientific data management by working on large-scale computing projects at Los Alamos. In addition, the students who take advantage of these opportunities will provide a pool of potential employees for the laboratory with skills in key areas of computer science and data management where the lab foresees significant staff needs in the future.</p><p>"We want to be able to hire people who already understand our problems and can come in and be immediately productive. This partnership will provide a valuable pipeline for recruitment and retention of staff in a key area for the laboratory," said Gary Grider of the High Performance Computing Systems Integration Group at Los Alamos.</p><p>UCSC's Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC) is a leading center for data-management research, and the expertise of faculty in this area made UCSC an ideal choice for this partnership, said Grider, who will direct the institute at Los Alamos. </p><p>Increases in computational power are driving the need for improvements in scientific data management. When powerful supercomputers run large-scale simulations of complex physical processes, enormous amounts of data are generated every second. The challenge for computer scientists is how to manage and store such a massive influx of data, said Darrell Long, who holds the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems Research at UCSC and will serve as the campus director of the new institute. </p><p>"The amount of data you may have to handle is on the scale of petabytes, or one quadrillion bytes. Doing data storage and data management for things that large is a real challenge," Long said.</p><p>The problem is much the same in the case of scientific experiments in which a large array of sensors are used to collect data, resulting in a flood of real-time data coming from the sensors. Grider said the institute will address aspects of data management related to both simulation data and real-time experimental data.</p><p>"We have challenges now with the vast amounts of simulation data we generate using the large computational platforms we have. And what we see on the horizon is an explosion of real-time experimental data coming from the engineering, manufacturing, and experimental side of the lab," Grider said.</p><p>Los Alamos has established similar institutes focusing on other disciplines in partnership with other UC campuses, including UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara. Los Alamos also has announced a partnership to form an advanced studies institute with three New Mexico universities.</p><p>At UC Santa Cruz, the primary participants in the ISSDM will be faculty and students affiliated with the SSRC, one of the major research groups in the Baskin School of Engineering. Directed by Long, the SSRC is focused on improving the performance, security, and reliability of data-storage systems and software.</p><p>The educational component of the new institute will include specialized courses delivered at both Los Alamos and UCSC via a two-way Internet link. Los Alamos senior scientists will serve as adjunct professors, lecturers, and mentors in the program. </p><p>"This allows us to offer courses that wouldn't otherwise be possible. It enables students to learn about things that very few institutions have the resources to offer," Long said.</p><p><i>Los Alamos National Laboratory is operated by the University of California for the National Nuclear Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy and works in partnership with NNSA's Sandia and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to support NNSA in its mission. Los Alamos enhances global security by ensuring the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, developing technical solutions to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction and solving problems related to energy, environment, infrastructure, health, and national security concerns.</i></p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Long at (831) 459-2616 or darrell@soe.ucsc.edu and Grider at (505) 665-9077 or ggrider@lanl.gov.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f49138072704601a012ff3f72dc4a"><name>775</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum will hold Dried Flower and Succulent Wreath Sale on November 19 and 20</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>Arboretum</keywords><start-date>1130828400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Arboretum will hold...</display-name><path>/2005/11/775</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/11/775</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338146512</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338146512</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Wonderful holiday decorations and gifts will be available from the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum at the annual Dried Flower and Succulent Wreath Sale on Saturday and Sunday, November 19 and 20.

Titled "Venice, the Jews and Italian Culture: Historical Eras and Cultural Representations," the institute is scheduled to take place in Venice from June 19 to July 21, 2006.</p><p>The five-week interdisciplinary program will explore the cultural, intellectual, and historical experience of Italian and Venetian Jews through the study of literary, artistic, and dramatic works. The institute is designed for the professional development of college and university teachers in various fields of study--including European culture, literature, art, history, Holocaust studies, Italian studies, and Jewish studies. </p><p>Baumgarten will serve as codirector of the institute along with Shaul Bassi, associate professor of literature at the University of Venice. The program will have its headquarters in the historic Jewish ghetto of Venice and include tours of Renaissance art and architecture, as well as a visit to the only concentration camp established by the Nazis in Italy. Optional instruction in Italian and Hebrew will also be available to participants.</p><p>"The University of Venice has been very hospitable to us, and they have offered us space to meet in," Baumgarten noted. "Their dean is also very interested in seeking a cooperative arrangement with UCSC in language studies--they teach 32 languages."</p><p>Baumgarten explained why he decided to create a summer institute that would focus on Venice. </p><p>"The Jewish community in Venice is an important but neglected piece of Jewish and European history," he said. "Having been expelled from most of Western Europe, Jews settled in Venice in 1516, and though they were sequestered in a ghetto, the Jewish community flourished in business and the arts. Jews were eventually allowed to become traders with the Middle Eastern world and had an integral role in early capitalism. They also built five synagogues in Baroque styles and changed the culture by introducing music and composers into the synagogue."</p><p>"Fifteen years after Gutenberg invented movable type, Venetian Jews with the help of Christian companies became involved in publishing books, and one-third of all Jewish books in the 16th century were published in Venice," Baumgarten added. "So the Jews of Venice became an important source of Jewish culture all over the world." </p><p>Baumgarten noted that one aspect of the project is to put together a Venetian Jewish anthology that includes significant documents, commentaries by scholars, and pieces by a variety of renowned Jewish authors. "Many famous writers visited Venice and wrote about it," said Baumgarten. "We will collect those documents and excerpt them--that will be a source for the teachers to use when they go back to the classroom."</p><p>NEH grants for summer institutes and seminars are awarded annually to offer teachers the opportunity to gain a deeper knowledge of current scholarship in the humanities. Baumgarten's project is one of 20 summer institutes funded nationwide this year through competitive grants totaling more than $3 million. Overall, the NEH awarded almost $20 million to fund 124 projects for 2006.</p><p>"The humanities convey the story of civilization, and NEH grant recipients tell that story," said NEH chairman Bruce Cole. "NEH supports projects that are rigorous, wide-ranging, and substantial in their examination and illumination of the great events and great ideas of the past."</p><p>Twenty-four teachers will be selected from around the country to participate in the Venice institute, and each will receive a stipend of $3,600.

For those determined to live next to this dynamic shoreline, the new book <i>Living with the Changing California Coast</i> should be required reading.</p>
<p>Written by Gary Griggs, Kiki Patsch, and Lauret Savoy, with contributions from more than a dozen other coastal experts, the book was released in November from the University of California Press. It is a completely revised and updated edition of the 1985 book <i>Living with the California Coast,</i> by Griggs and Savoy. Griggs is a professor of Earth sciences and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Patsch and Savoy both worked with Griggs as graduate students, and Patsch is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Virginia, while Savoy is a professor of geology and environmental studies at Mount Holyoke College.</p>
<p>The first part of the book provides a wealth of background information on coastal processes and hazards, with advice for home buyers, residents, coastal managers, and developers. There are sections on climate change, rising sea levels, coastal erosion, responding to coastal hazards, and coastal policy and legislation. The second part of the book consists of 12 chapters, each providing a comprehensive discussion of one geographic section of the coast.</p>
<p>"There has been a lot of investment on the coast, both public and private, so we need to heighten people's awareness of these issues," Griggs said.</p>
<p>Much has changed in the 20 years since the first edition appeared. People have continued to move to the coast, property values have skyrocketed, and the coast has been battered by stronger and more frequent storms. Starting with the El Ni&#241;o event of 1978, the coastal climate shifted from a more moderate phase of its cycle to a period dominated by major El Ni&#241;o events that bring powerful and destructive storms to the California coast.</p>
<p>"We entered this period of big El Ni&#241;o events, with stronger storms, more cliff retreat, more beach erosion, and more seawall proposals. The combination of more people, more hazards, and higher property values has focused a lot of attention on this narrow strip of shoreline that is constantly changing," Griggs said.</p>
<p>The book includes nearly 300 photographs and 81 detailed maps covering the entire coast. Patsch prepared the maps using geographic information system (GIS) technology to provide precise information on geologic hazards along all 1,100 miles of the California coastline. The maps include hazard ratings, erosion rates where available, descriptions of coastal landforms, locations of seawalls and other types of armoring, and other useful and interesting information about every stretch of shoreline.</p>
<p>The photographs include dramatic illustrations of damage to coastal structures, as well as extensive documentation of natural and man-made features along the coast. Many of the photos were provided by the California Coastal Records Project, which includes photographs of the entire coastline on its web site (<a href="http://www.Californiacoastline.org">www.Californiacoastline.org</a>).</p>
<p>"We have much better photo coverage of the coast in this edition, and the GIS-based maps are more accurate and easier to read," Griggs said.</p>
<p><i>Living with the Changing California Coast</i> is an essential resource for those intending to buy or build along the coast, for planners in coastal cities and counties, and for anyone who needs or wants specific information about California's various coastal regions. Aside from its practical value, the book provides a fascinating look at one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world, with information on its natural history, the forces that have shaped it, and how it continues to evolve over time.</p>
<p>"I think it should appeal to anybody who is interested in the coast and curious about the way the coastline operates, how it changes, and what are the issues we face in dealing with coastal hazards," Griggs said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f4cfa8072704601a012ff57ef89b0"><name>778</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC physicists deliver detector for NASA's GLAST telescope</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>high-energy astrophysics, GLAST, gamma rays</keywords><start-date>1131433200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC physicists deliver detector...</display-name><path>/2005/11/778</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/11/778</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338147498</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338147498</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>After more than a decade of work, a team led by physicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has completed a major detector subsystem for NASA's Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). Completion of the tracking detector is a significant milestone for the telescope project, scheduled for launch in 2007.</p><p>GLAST will give astronomers a powerful new tool for studying the sources of high-energy gamma rays in the universe. It will help astronomers investigate poorly understood phenomena such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, pulsars, and gamma-ray bursts. Scientists also hope to learn about the fundamental properties of the universe itself by studying how gamma rays propagate across the universe. </p><p>"With GLAST, we can look at gamma rays emitted from the farthest reaches of the universe and study the sources of those gamma rays. We expect that GLAST will see thousands of quasars and related objects," said Robert Johnson, a professor of physics at UCSC and manager of the tracker subsystem for the telescope.</p><p>The tracking detector will give GLAST unprecedented sensitivity for detecting high-energy gamma rays and pinpointing their sources in the sky. The design, engineering, and fabrication of the detector was overseen by Johnson and other researchers at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC. The project was a collaborative effort involving SCIPP, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and institutions in Italy and Japan.</p><p>GLAST will be much more powerful than its predecessor, the EGRET experiment that operated on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in the 1990s, Johnson said. </p><p>"Currently there is no other telescope that can detect gamma rays within the energy range that GLAST will cover, and it will be 30 to 100 times more sensitive than any previous gamma-ray telescope," he said. </p><p>The tracking detector has nearly 900,000 detector channels, each connected to its own amplifier. Packed into 16 compact modules are nearly 80 square meters of solid-state silicon detectors and 576 electronics boards, all supported on a carbon-composite structure. The whole system operates on just 160 watts of power, and it had to be designed to withstand severe vibrations during the rocket launch that will carry the telescope into orbit.</p><p>"It is really an unprecedented design for a detector system that will be put into space," Johnson said.</p><p>The initial design work for the GLAST detector was begun in 1992 by William Atwood, then at SLAC and now an adjunct professor of physics at UCSC. Johnson began collaborating with Atwood on the detector project in 1994, and in 2000, NASA chose their detector from among several competing designs for the GLAST mission. Three weeks ago, SCIPP scientists and their international team delivered the last of the detector modules to the integration and test team at SLAC, where the modules were installed into the overall instrument structure. </p><p>Over the years, many UCSC undergraduates and graduate students have contributed to SCIPP's work on the GLAST project, Johnson said. In addition to Atwood and Johnson, other UCSC faculty involved in the project are Hartmut Sadrozinski and Terry Schalk, both adjunct professors of physics.</p><p>High-energy astrophysicists at UCSC and elsewhere are eagerly awaiting the day when GLAST will begin collecting data. GLAST's main instrument, the Large Area Telescope for which the tracking detector was built, will provide unprecedented sensitivity to gamma rays in the energy range of about 20 MeV to about 300 GeV. Other space-based gamma-ray instruments, such as NASA's Swift mission, cover lower energy ranges, while new ground-based instruments will detect higher-energy gamma rays.</p><p>"The new generation of ground-based gamma-ray observatories cover complementary energy ranges and will work closely with GLAST," Johnson said. "We are looking forward to quite an exciting time in terms of being able to reach into new energy ranges and hopefully find the answers to fundamental questions about the universe."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Johnson at (831) 459-2125 or rjohnson@scipp.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f4e4d8072704601a012ff925f34f6"><name>779</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC presents Jack Baskin with achievement award</title><author>Elizabeth M.

Denton announced that $2.7 million was raised in the last year to benefit scholarships and fellowships for undergraduate and graduate students at UC Santa Cruz. The announcement was made on Saturday (November 5) to approximately 350 campus supporters at the annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner. At the dinner a year ago, campus officials said that $1 million had been raised for that purpose.</p><p><table align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="9" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td width="5"></td><td BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><b><font color="#333333">Record amount nearly triples the $1 million announced at last year's benefit dinner</font></b></td></tr></table>"Support for students changes lives," Denton stated. After asking for a show of hands of those attending the dinner to indicate how many had benefited from scholarships or fellowships, she said, "It's clear that most of us can attest personally to the value of supporting students."</p><p>The dinner was co-hosted by the UCSC Alumni Association and the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. Dominic Siababa and Anuradha Luther Maitra, presidents, respectively, of those organizations, officiated at the event. Besides Denton, other speakers included Professor Faye Crosby, Academic Senate Chair, and Tremain Jones, a recent graduate and scholarship recipient. </p><p>The event culminated a series of activities celebrating Denton's investiture as the campus's 9th chancellor. Earlier in the week, Denton had hosted a symposium on "Achieving Excellence through Diversity," and on Friday, November 4, UC President Dynes officially invested Denton as chancellor. Approximately 400 campus members and friends attended the investiture and inaugural address, which Denton sprinkled with statements in Japanese, Arabic, Spanish and Swahili to underscore the theme of diversity and excellence. In her remarks, she highlighted six priorities that will guide the future of the campus, while acknowledging the work of the campus pioneers and others whose efforts have brought the campus to its present distinction.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f50e08072704601a012ff3be0e1b0"><name>781</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Rapidly accelerating glaciers may increase how fast the sea level rises</title><author>Emily Saarman or Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>global warming, climate change, sea level</keywords><start-date>1131951600000</start-date><display-name>Rapidly accelerating glaciers may...</display-name><path>/2005/11/781</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/11/781</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338148510</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338148510</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Satellite images show that, after decades of stability, a major glacier draining the Greenland ice sheet has dramatically increased its speed and retreated nearly five miles in recent years. These changes could contribute to rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet and cause the global sea level to rise faster than expected, according to researchers studying the glacier. </p><p>A paper describing these findings will be published this month in <i>Geophysical Research Letters.</i> The study focused on the Helheim glacier, one of the largest outlet glaciers in Greenland. Warming air and sea temperatures in the area likely caused the glacier to speed up, said Slawek Tulaczyk, associate professor of Earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a coauthor of the paper.</p><p>The Greenland ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea levels by 15 to 20 feet. Although the entire ice sheet is unlikely to melt in this century, even a small change in the rate of melting could inundate low-lying coastal plains and add enough fresh water to the North Atlantic to change ocean circulation patterns, Tulaczyk said.</p><p>Ian Howat, a UCSC doctoral candidate in Earth sciences and first author on the paper, said changes such as this could have dramatic implications for climate models. Scientists use complex mathematical models to predict how climate, sea level, and ocean circulation will change in response to growing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p><p>"Current models treat the ice sheet like it's just an ice cube sitting up there melting, and we're finding it's not that simple," Howat said.</p><p>The researchers used satellite images to determine the movement and retreat of Helheim glacier. Howat tracked the positions of glacial surface features to assess how fast the glacier moved between satellite fly-bys. Satellite images dating back as far as the 1970s show that the front of the glacier has remained in the same place for decades. But in 2001 it began retreating rapidly, moving back four and a half miles between 2001 and 2005. Howat's measurements also show that the Helheim glacier has sped up from around 70 feet per day to nearly 110 feet per day and thinned by more than 130 feet since 2001. </p><p>As the glacier speeds up and retreats, new factors come into play that cause further acceleration and retreat, Howat said. "This is a very fast glacier, and it's likely to get faster," he said.</p><p>The Helheim glacier is a river of ice that pours from the inland Greenland ice sheet, through a narrow rift in the coastal mountain range, and down into the sea at a rate of several miles per year. In the sea, the glacier's weight keeps it firmly resting on the bottom, as long as the water depth is less than about nine-tenths of the glacier's thickness. Where the water is deep enough to cause the end of the glacier to float, its front becomes brittle and crumbles into icebergs, Tulaczyk explained.</p><p>Warming disrupts the delicate balance between glacier thickness and water depth by melting and thinning the glacier. Temperatures in Greenland have increased by more than five degrees Fahrenheit (three degrees Celsius) over the last decade. If the glacier thins beyond a critical point, it becomes ungrounded, floats, and rapidly disintegrates. </p><p>"Outlet glaciers may have been thinning for over a decade," Howat said. "But it's only in the last few years that thinning reached a critical point and began drastically changing the glacier's dynamics."</p><p>The retreating front of the glacier causes it to move down the mountain slope more rapidly. This thins the glacier further, which causes upstream parts of the glacier to perceive a steeper slope and begin moving faster, Tulaczyk said.</p><p>Many fiords, the channels carved by glaciers flowing into the sea, are deep with a shallow lip in front. Once the glacier floats off this shallow pinning point, it retreats into deeper water, making further disintegration likely. Reduced friction between ice and rock at the glacier bed can also increase glacier speed. Fiords often widen inland, causing the glacier to grate less heavily at the fiord walls and move faster as it retreats. And ice crystals in fast-moving glaciers can realign, further reducing friction, Howat said.</p><p>The Helheim glacier's speedup has already propagated 12.5 miles up the glacier. The center of the Greenland ice sheet is only 150 miles inland, and the researchers worry that the effects of the glacier's retreat will continue to move inland, ultimately decreasing the thickness of the whole ice sheet.</p><p>"If other glaciers in Greenland are responding like Helheim, it could easily cut in half the time it will take to destroy the Greenland ice sheet," Howat said. "This is a process we thought was only happening in Antarctica, and now we're seeing that it happens really fast in Greenland."</p><p>Recent studies have shown that many other glaciers in the southern half of Greenland are retreating. To date, only one other glacier, the Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier in the southwest, has been studied sufficiently to determine that it is speeding up as it retreats. But Tulaczyk expects similar mechanisms are at work in other retreating glaciers. </p><p>"Our research provides strong evidence that rapid melting processes such as we observed at the Helheim glacier will play a role in ice sheet reduction, but they are currently not included in the models," Tulaczyk said. "My ultimate goal is to convince ice sheet modelers to incorporate this dynamic process in the models."</p><p>In addition to Howat and Tulaczyk, the authors of the paper include Ian Joughin of the University of Washington and Sivaprasad Gogineni of the University of Kansas. The research was funded by grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation.</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Tulaczyk at (831) 459-5207 or tulaczyk@es.ucsc.edu and Howat at ihowat@pmc.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f52298072704601a012fff524b546"><name>782</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Philanthropist Jack Baskin chosen for Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1132124400000</start-date><display-name>Philanthropist Jack Baskin chosen...</display-name><path>/2005/11/782</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/11/782</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338148857</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338148857</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jack Baskin, whose steadfast support led to the establishment and rapid growth of the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has been selected for induction into the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame. The Silicon Valley Engineering Council (SVEC) announced the Hall of Fame winners last night during the group's annual open house at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. </p><p>Baskin and four other distinguished engineering leaders will be formally inducted into the Hall of Fame in a ceremony hosted by the SVEC on February 24, 2006. The Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame recognizes local engineers for outstanding professional achievement and significant contributions to the Silicon Valley community. </p><p>The other inductees announced last night are Thomas Kailath, Hitachi America professor emeritus at Stanford University; Jerry Sanders, chairman of the board emeritus at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD); Sass Somekh, president of Novellus Systems; and Lotfi Zadeh, professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Baskin and Sanders were both nominated for this honor by Steve Kang, dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering and a former president of the SVEC. </p><p>"It is a great pleasure to see these deserving nominees selected for the Hall of Fame," Kang said. "Jerry Sanders is considered one of the architects of Silicon Valley and one of its best CEOs. Jack Baskin's commitment to bettering the community is reflected in both his professional activities and his long history of active involvement and support for engineering at UC Santa Cruz."</p><p>Baskin, who earned a B.S. in aeronautical engineering from New York University, built a successful development company that worked on commercial, industrial, and public construction projects throughout California. In 1967, Baskin moved to Palo Alto from southern California and sought to fill what he saw as a serious need for affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. Now retired, he is a leading philanthropist in the Santa Cruz community. </p><p>Baskin has been actively supporting engineering programs at UCSC for over two decades, providing guidance to faculty and university leadership as well as generous financial support. In 1997, his gift of $5 million helped launch the Baskin School of Engineering. His donations to the engineering school now total almost $8 million. Baskin, who has served as a UCSC Foundation trustee since 1978, was recently honored as the first recipient of UCSC's "Fiat Lux Award."</p><p>"His leadership, support, and guidance in the creation of the Baskin School of Engineering will have a long-term impact through the preparation of students for engineering careers that will enhance the quality of life for many generations to come," Kang said.</p><p>Jerry Sanders, the visionary cofounder of AMD, led the company to become one of the leading semiconductor manufacturers in the world. He also cofounded several prominent industry groups, including the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Santa Clara Manufacturing Group, the Semiconductor Research Corporation, SEMATECH, and the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation. </p><p>Sanders earned a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Kang, who served as professor and department head of electrical and computer engineering at UIUC before coming to UCSC, knew Sanders as one of his department's most distinguished alumni.

So UCSC researchers were thrilled when their proposal to sequence the complete genomes of five species of Archaea was approved earlier this year by the Community Sequencing Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute (JGI). JGI will carry out the sequencing and make the results publicly available.</p><p>"Having complete genome sequences will be enormously helpful to our research," said Todd Lowe, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering.</p><p>Lowe and Chad Saltikov, an assistant professor of environmental toxicology at UCSC, teamed up with Sorel Fitz-Gibbon of UCLA and Christopher House of Pennsylvania State University to submit the Archaea proposal to the Community Sequencing Program. The five species they proposed for sequencing are closely related heat-loving Archaea found in various hot springs from Iceland to the Philippines. These species belong to a unique group of Archaea that can use sulfur compounds and toxic metals like arsenic and selenium to power their cells. They use these compounds in much the same way that our own cells use oxygen, Lowe said.</p><p>One of Lowe's goals is to identify the genes and metabolic pathways that enable the Archaea to thrive at extremely high temperatures and make use of toxic compounds. His lab investigates the unique biology of Archaea using a combination of laboratory experiments and computational techniques for genetic analysis.</p><p>Superficially, Archaea look much like bacteria. It wasn't until about 25 years ago that genetic techniques enabled scientists to see beyond the cell surface and recognize the differences between Archaea and bacteria.</p><p>"Archaea are as different from bacteria as bacteria are from us," Lowe said. "They account for a third of the biodiversity on the planet and they've hardly been studied."</p><p>Scientists now divide all known organisms into three distinct domains: the eukaryotes, which include all plants, animals, and fungi; the bacteria; and Archaea. </p><p>"We're studying a third group of life that we know very little about and that may tell us about the origin of life, how life works, and geochemical processes. It's really exciting," said Aaron Cozen, a graduate student in Lowe's lab.</p><p>Archaea have already yielded some useful products, such as heat-resistant enzymes used in laundry detergents. Other practical benefits are likely to emerge from ongoing research on the unusual metabolism and genetics of these organisms, said Saltikov, who is focusing on their metabolic use of arsenic.</p><p>The use of naturally occurring arsenic by Archaea and certain types of bacteria has serious consequences in some parts of the world, because the process converts the arsenic to a more toxic form that is also more likely to remain dissolved in water. In Bangladesh, many people have been poisoned by drinking water that is laden with this toxic form of arsenic. Saltikov and others have already found the bacterial gene involved in arsenic respiration, but they have not found a match for this gene in Archaea.</p><p>"Archaea may have the same gene, but the sequence is so different that it's not recognizable. Or they may have a completely different metabolic pathway, or an older pathway that leads us to greater understanding of the bacterial mechanism," Saltikov said.</p><p>For now, the biggest challenge for Lowe and Saltikov is learning how to grow Archaea and experiment with them in the lab. Many Archaea are poisoned by oxygen and have to be grown in special airtight containers. The heat-loving Archaea that Lowe is studying can only live at near-boiling temperatures and have to be grown in ovens. Keeping the conditions just right can be difficult and expensive, which limits the kinds of experiments researchers can do.</p><p>"These Archaea are more difficult than bacteria to grow and keep happy, so there are fewer ways we can assault them to learn about how they respond," Lowe said. He hopes that at least one of the five species chosen for genome sequencing will be easy to grow so it can become a model system for him and other scientists studying Archaea. </p><p>DNA microarrays (sometimes called "gene chips") are among the most powerful tools that Lowe is using to study Archaeal biology. Microarrays can provide a comprehensive view of gene activity in cells, revealing which genes are turned on and off in response to different conditions. Lowe's lab has already developed DNA microarrays based on the full genome sequences of two species of Archaea, and he plans to do the same for the five new species that will be sequenced by JGI. Using this "whole genome" approach to study Archaeal biology, he hopes to uncover the secrets that enable these organisms to live at the extreme limits of life on Earth.</p><p>"It's really exciting to know that you are the first person to understand something," Lowe said. "It's the potential for discovery of new biology that keeps me in this field."</p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Todd Lowe at (831) 459-1511 or lowe@soe.ucsc.edu and Chad Saltikov at (831) 459-5520 or saltikov@etox.ucsc.edu</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f54a88072704601a012fff8b63696"><name>784</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two UCSC engineering professors named IEEE Fellows</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>IEEE</keywords><start-date>1132556400000</start-date><display-name>Two UCSC engineering professors...</display-name><path>/2005/11/784</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/11/784</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338149495</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338149495</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two faculty members of the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have been elected Fellows of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

The bill includes about $2 million for each of the programs: the Center for Integrated Marine Technologies (CIMT), an ongoing effort to improve long-term monitoring of ocean ecosystems, and the Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI), a science and technology partnership based in Silicon Valley.</p><p>The BIN-RDI is planned as a broad partnership of government, academia, and industry focusing on the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology. Based at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, it is a key component of UCSC's Silicon Valley Initiative.</p><p>The BIN-RDI will support both open-exchange fundamental research and industry-supported start-up research aimed at developing breakthrough bio-info-nano fusion technologies. It will also provide an educational test-bed for novel curricula and teaching methodologies to develop a workforce for the future, and will exert national influence on technology policy and investment, said Carl Walsh, UCSC vice provost for Silicon Valley initiatives. </p><p>"The BIN-RDI offers a great opportunity to build on UCSC's successful partnership with NASA Ames in the University Affiliated Research Center, while leveraging the research strengths of UC, NASA Ames, and industry to maintain the Silicon Valley's leadership as the global center for innovation," Walsh said.</p><p>Congresswoman Anna Eshoo helped get funding for the BIN-RDI included in the appropriations bill. </p><p>"I'm very proud to have helped secure federal resources for the Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute," Eshoo said. "This project capitalizes on the very best of NASA Ames, UC Santa Cruz, the entire UC system, and the many other private-sector and academic partners. This effort will launch a new generation of skilled workers and scientists, fostering American innovation in the 21st century. It's exactly what we should be doing to keep America the world's leader in groundbreaking research and technology."</p><p>The CIMT, established in 2002, brings together scientists from six partner institutions around Monterey Bay to study the processes that drive California's highly productive coastal ecosystems. The center serves as a regional pilot project for a national integrated ocean observing system, a top priority of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other federal agencies. Congressional funding for the center dried up after three years, however, and researchers have struggled to keep it running for the past year. The renewed funding comes at a crucial time, said Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and chair of CIMT's board of directors.</p><p>"This is really great news, because the Central Coast is one of only a few places in the world with a highly productive coastal upwelling system, and through CIMT we are well on our way to putting in place a coastal observation system and figuring out how this whole system works," Griggs said. "This renewed funding will enable us to continue doing the technology development and integrated long-term monitoring needed to observe trends in the system over time."</p><p>Congressman Sam Farr negotiated funds for the program as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.</p><p>"Ocean observation provides the foundation of knowledge we need to develop and enact more effective ocean management policies, like ecosystem-based management," Farr said. "CIMT is a critical contributor to this research on both a local and national level, and I am pleased to be able to secure this funding for them."</p><p>The appropriations bill that includes funds for CIMT and BIN-RDI (the Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Bill) has been approved by both houses of Congress. </p><p>______</p><p><b>Note to reporters:</b> You may contact Walsh at (831) 459-4082 or walshc@ucsc.edu and Griggs at (831) 459-5006 or griggs@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f57248072704601a012ffcc8396a4"><name>786</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Thar she glows!

Denton announced today (November 30) that UC Santa Cruz will extend to January 11 the time in which the public may comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Report of the campus's proposed Long Range Development Plan. Responding to a request made by the City of Santa Cruz, the extension emphasizes UCSC's intent to engage as fully as possible with the City in addressing future challenges together.</p><p><table align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="9" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td width="5"></td><td BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><b><font color="#333333">Addition of more than three weeks underscores commitment to collaboration with the City of Santa Cruz</font></b></td></tr></table>"We greatly value our partnership with the City of Santa Cruz and have decided to further augment the public comment period to accommodate the City's request. We understand that there is a turnover in the City's planning staff, and we want to be certain that the City has enough time to review this important document," Denton said. "At the same time, by nearly doubling the amount of time legally required, we want to make it clear that the university welcomes and values comments from everyone in our community."</p><p>The extension adds 23 days to the comment period, for a total of 83 days, almost double the legal minimum of 45 days specified by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).</p><p>The comment period now ends at 5 p.m. on January 11, 2006. All interested parties can submit written comments anytime before that deadline.</p><p>The Draft EIR was released by UCSC in mid-October, beginning what had been a 60-day comment period. The original deadline was 5 p.m. on December 19.</p><p>UC Santa Cruz is holding two public hearings on the Draft EIR. The first was held on November 16; the second is scheduled from 3 to 6 p.m. today (November 30). CEQA requires one public hearing.</p><p>Written comments may be e-mailed, mailed, or hand-delivered to UCSC anytime before the new deadline.</p><p>The Draft EIR may be reviewed at no cost at three local libraries; it can also be ordered for purchase at two area copy centers.</p><p>For detailed information on accessing the Draft EIR and for details on how to submit a comment, please go to the project web site at: <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu">lrdp.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27bbaa38072704601a012ff3758f4d8"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626271868</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626271868</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27bbaa38072704601a012ff3758f4d8"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/11/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626271868</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626271868</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
