If all goes well with a technical study approved by NASA for this year, the telescope should be orbiting Earth by the end of the decade and taking the first focused high-energy x-ray pictures of matter falling into black holes and shooting out of exploding stars. </p><p>Named the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), the project has just been pegged by NASA for detailed study in the competitive Small Explorer Program, which seeks out new technologies and new proposals for space missions that can be launched at low cost. Pending a final NASA review next year, NuSTAR will be scheduled for launch in 2009. </p><p>"This is a real explorer mission. There has never been a sharp focusing telescope in this part of the spectrum before, so there is a very broad range of exploration science that needs to be done," said Stephen Thorsett, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Thorsett chairs the science team of 11 co-investigators from seven institutions who have been planning the science goals for NuSTAR. Stan Woosley, also a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, is another of the co-investigators. Supermassive black holes, gamma-ray jets, and the birth of new elements in supernovae are the three main areas of investigation planned for NuSTAR. But Thorsett said the most interesting results are likely to be the unexpected ones.</p><p>"We're almost certain to be surprised. Even in the first calibration observations, when we plan to look at local neutron stars, I expect the results will provide a thesis worth of work for a graduate student," he said.</p><p>According to Fiona Harrison, a California Institute of Technology astrophysicist and principal investigator of the NuSTAR project, an April high-altitude balloon flight in New Mexico should help to demonstrate whether the telescope's advanced sensors, invented and built at Caltech, are ready for space. The balloon test will mark the first time that focused pictures at high-energy ("hard") x-ray wavelengths will have been returned from high altitudes. </p><p>Focusing hard x-rays the way an optical telescope focuses light is technically very challenging, but well worth the effort, Thorsett said. Hard x-rays tend to penetrate the gas and dust of galaxies much better than the soft x-rays observed by existing x-ray satellites. NuSTAR will be 1,000 times more capable of finding new black holes than anything previously launched into space. </p><p>"Black holes that have large amounts of matter falling into them shine very brightly in this part of the spectrum, and the signal can get out of the cores of galaxies because hard x-rays are very penetrating. So this telescope will give us a very direct way to see and measure the growth of supermassive black holes, which we think are very common in the cores of galaxies," Thorsett said.</p><p>Studying black holes is one of three basic science goals for NuSTAR. The telescope will be used to take a census of black holes at all scales, and will also measure the "accretion rate" at which matter has fallen into them over time.</p><p>Another goal is to detect and measure radiation emitted in the aftermath of stellar explosions, or supernovae. The remnants of supernovae that exploded centuries ago still emit signals that can shed new light on how elements are formed and ejected in supernovae. NuSTAR will be especially good at observing the radioactive decay of titanium to calcium, which tends to be produced in the region of a supernova where material either is ejected forever from the explosion or falls back inward to form a compact remnant of some sort. NuSTAR will provide a direct test of theories developed by Woosley and others to explain how the elements are formed.</p><p>"We can look at these newborn elements in supernova remnants and compare the observations with the predictions from computer models," Thorsett said.</p><p>The third goal is to observe the highly energetic jets that stream out of certain black holes at nearly the speed of light. Coupled with observations from the Gamma-Ray Large-Area Space Telescope (GLAST), NuSTAR will provide data to help scientists explain this still-enigmatic but powerful phenomenon. </p><p>UCSC scientists are also involved in the GLAST project, which will use detectors designed and built by UCSC physicists in the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics. </p><p>"NuSTAR is another step in the development of a strong program in high-energy astrophysics at UCSC. Together with our partner institutions in the Bay Area and southern California, and other national and international partners, we are looking forward to a very active future for high-energy astrophysics research," Thorsett said. </p><p>In addition to UCSC and Caltech, the other participating organizations and universities in the NuSTAR project are the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (managed by Caltech for NASA), Columbia University, Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Sonoma State University, and the Danish Space Research Institute. NuSTAR's spacecraft will be built by General Dynamics Spectrum Astro.</p><p>The Small Explorer Program is designed to provide frequent, low-cost access to space for physics and astronomy missions with small to midsized spacecraft. NASA has successfully launched six SMEX missions since 1992. The missions include the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, launched in February 2002, and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, launched in April 2003 and led by Caltech physics professor Chris Martin.</p><p>The selected proposals were among 29 SMEX and eight mission-of-opportunity proposals submitted to NASA in May 2003. They were in response to an Explorer Program Announcement of Opportunity issued in February 2003. NASA selected six proposals in November 2003 for detailed feasibility studies. Of these, NASA has now selected the International Boundary Explorer for launch in 2008 and NuSTAR for a possible launch in 2009.</p><p>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., manages the Explorer Program for the Science Mission Directorate.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Thorsett at (831) 459-5170 or thorsett@ucolick.org.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e7ab98072704601a012ffab98c12d"><name>632</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Indonesian tsunami benefit set for Feb. 12 at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1107241200000</start-date><display-name>Indonesian tsunami benefit set...</display-name><path>/2005/02/632</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/02/632</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338093701</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338093701</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Department will present a special benefit performance for the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia on Saturday, February 12, from 3:30 to 5 p.m. at UCSC's Second Stage Theater. </p><p>	</p><p>The event will feature a dance performance by visiting Indonesian choreographers Irawati Durban and Bulan Djelantik, plus Bay Area gamelan players led by UCSC Music Department lecturer Undang Sumarna, and local dancers who have performed extensively in Indonesia. </p><p>Santa Cruz resident and Sumatran scholar Sjamsir Sjarif will also speak briefly about conditions in Aceh--Indonesia's tsunami-battered province that was one of the most devastated areas affected by the Dec. 26 disaster that killed more than 150,000 people and left thousands missing throughout southern Asia.  </p><p>"That part of Indonesia is one of the hardest places to get into because of the insurgency of the last five years," noted UCSC theater arts professor Kathy Foley, who is coordinating the benefit. "Outsiders have been banned for some time because Americans had been going in and writing negative things about the national government. So it has been a complicating factor in relief efforts."</p><p>"Getting aid to where it needs to be dispersed is not always a straightforward path in Indonesia," Foley added. "From what I've heard from people in Jakarta, the government is doing everything it can, but the infrastructure is just not set up for the true flow of aid that we would have if it was Florida."</p><p>Foley said that proceeds from the benefit will be directed to organizations such as the Indonesian Lions Club International, Doctors Without Borders, and World Vision. </p><p>"Our intention is to set up a table that identifies these organizations and allow people to donate in whichever direction they desire," she said. "Because I personally know the individuals involved in each of these organizations, we know the money will definitely get there."</p><p>The benefit was organized in conjunction with a student theatrical production that is scheduled to run on campus in February. Titled The Ghostly Goddess and  the Sinner Saint: How Islam Came to Java," the production is directed by Foley and features choreography by the guest Indonesian artists. Performances will take place at 7 p.m. (Sundays at 3 p.m.) on Feb. 4-6 and 10-13 at the Theater Arts Second Stage. </p><p>"People wanted to do something and we had this opportunity to utilize these guest artists who were already here choreographing and directing a dance/drama for the Theater Arts Department," Foley explained. "And because I was directing the production, I had access to the performing space. So we hope to bring together the campus, Indonesian, and Santa Cruz communities."</p><p>Durban, a senior lecturer at Indonesian College of the Arts (STSI) in Bandung, has performed internationally since 1964. A visiting artist at UCSC this winter quarter, she recently presented a seminar for the UCSC Arts Division that included an exhibit of Southeast Asian masks, which are now on display at the East-West Center on the grounds of the University of Hawaii.</p><p>"The Indonesians will be very thankful for all the Americans who helped and tried to collect money for the Tsumami victims-not only in Indonesia, but in other countries as well," Durban observed. "Young children were even making cookies and selling them in malls to raise money. We are very impressed and grateful."</p><p>"It's a drop in the ocean, but it's doing something," added Djelantik, who has taught Balinese dance nationally and internationally since the 1970s. "It's helping to make the image of Americans in Muslim countries like Indonesia more popular."</p><p>_____</p><p>The Feb. 12 benefit at 3:30 p.m. is limited to 200 people and seating will be first-come, first-served. Donations are requested. It will be followed at 7 p.m. by a performance of The Ghostly Goddess and the Sinner Saint--tickets for the evening performance are available at the UCSC Ticket Office: (831) 459-2159.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e7bfe8072704601a012ff1b2f6ee3"><name>633</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Journalists Amy Goodman and Naomi Klein to speak at UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1107327600000</start-date><display-name>Journalists Amy Goodman and...</display-name><path>/2005/02/633</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/02/633</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338094026</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338094026</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Amy Goodman, host of Pacifica Radio's Democracy Now! program, and Naomi Klein, author of No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies, will each give a free public talk at UC Santa Cruz in February during two separate events hosted by College Ten.</p>
<p>Goodman will appear at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, February 23, when she will reflect on the life of slain Los Angeles Times reporter Ruben Salazar during a talk about the importance of independent, corporate-free media and the role it plays in democracy. (<strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The starting time for this event was initially listed as 7 p.m.)</p>
<p>Goodman began her career in community radio in 1985 and helped launch Democracy Now! in 1996. She is also coauthor of the best-selling book, The Exception to the Rulers: Exposing Oily Politicians, War Profiteers, and the Media Who Love Them. Her talk will take place in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. During the event, Goodman will be presented with College Ten's first Ruben Salazar Journalism Award, which honors the memory of Salazar, who was killed during an anti-Vietnam War protest in East Los Angeles when he was hit in the head by a police tear gas canister.</p>
<p>Klein's talk, "War &amp; Fleece: How Economic 'Shock Therapy' Backfired in Iraq," will begin at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, February 16. Klein will discuss the Bush administration's efforts to transform Iraq into a "free-market utopia" and the forces of resistance the reforms unleashed. She will suggest specific actions activists can take to support the struggle for genuine freedom and sovereignty in Iraq. Klein is an award-winning journalist and the author of Fences &amp; Windows: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Globalization Debate. She writes an internationally syndicated column for the Nation, the Guardian, and the Globe and Mail. Klein's talk will also take place in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.</p>
<p>The public is invited to attend the lectures, which are free, but seating is limited. Ticket distribution for both events will begin at noon on Monday, February 7, in Social Sciences 1, Room 104; limit one ticket per person. Priority will be given to College Nine and College Ten students with student identification. Ticket distribution will continue until 4 p.m. that day and will take place every weekday from noon to 1:30 p.m. while supplies last. Call (831) 459-1253 for updated information on ticket availability. Ticket holders are advised to arrive at the events by the scheduled start time; tickets not redeemed by that time may be considered void, and open seats will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>Both events will be broadcast live on campus radio station KZSC and cable television (channel 30), and Community Television of Santa Cruz County plans to simulcast Goodman's talk.</p>

Patterson Medal for Environmental Chemistry from the Geochemical Society.</p>
<p>Bruland currently holds the Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health at UCSC. He is an expert on ocean chemistry and the ways in which certain trace elements influence marine ecosystems. Much of his research has focused on the role of trace metals in the growth of phytoplankton, microscopic algae that form the base of marine food webs.</p>
<p>Election as a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) recognizes scientists who have attained acknowledged eminence in one or more branches of geophysics and is one of the few honors that the group confers. The AGU limits the number of fellows elected each year to no more than a tenth of a percent of its membership. Bruland's election recognizes his lifetime achievements in the area of chemical oceanography. The award will be presented at the AGU's spring meeting in New Orleans in May.</p>
<p>The Geochemical Society's Patterson Medal is awarded to individuals who have made an exceptional contribution to the field of environmental geochemistry. The medal recognizes Bruland's record of highly significant contributions to the field of trace-metal biogeochemistry. It will be presented at the Goldschmidt Conference, the premier annual meeting in geochemistry and mineralogy, in Moscow, Idaho, in May.</p>
<p>Bruland and his students have pioneered the development of clean sampling and analytical methods for the determination of trace metals (and metalloids) in natural waters. His research group has also pioneered the development of analytical methods for the determination of the chemical form or speciation of metals, in particular the degree to which metals such as iron, copper, zinc, cadmium, and cobalt bind to organic compounds in seawater.</p>
<p>Bruland has played a central role in studies of iron as a limiting nutrient in large portions of the Earth's oceans. He has been the chief scientist of major oceanographic research expeditions studying the role of iron as a limiting nutrient, most recently to the Bering Sea and the Peru upwelling regime. In addition to his studies of metals as limiting nutrients, Bruland has also pioneered research on toxic metals in both freshwater and coastal environments. This work includes research on the chemical speciation of selenium, arsenic, mercury, and lead.</p>
<p>Bruland has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed publications, which have had a demonstrable impact on his field. He is listed among the select group of "Highly Cited Scientists" identified by ISI, a company that specializes in analyzing the scientific literature. ISI compiles lists of the authors whose work is most frequently cited by other researchers. ISI's Highly Cited Scientists represent less than one-half of one percent of all publishing researchers (see <a href="http://isihighlycited.com">isihighlycited.com</a>).</p>
<p>Bruland joined the UCSC faculty in 1974. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award in 2001-02 from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.

But as people age, they rely more heavily on a comparison process that favors positive emotional outcomes, said lead researcher Mara Mather, an associate professor of psychology at UCSC.</p><p>"The results add a twist to our understanding of how people remember things that weren't there," said Mather, who coauthored the paper with UCSC graduate student Marisa Knight and then-undergraduate Michael McCaffrey, who graduated in 2003. "The way we remember one option is shaped by what we know of the other options, and the comparison process changes as we age."</p><p>"People are always surprised by how malleable memory is, but researchers have really only scratched the surface," added Mather.</p><p>Mather's research used studies of decision making to glean insight into how inaccurate memories are generated. The first study explored how adults make decisions when two options lack directly comparable features. For example, when deciding between rental apartments, prospective tenants compare features such as rent, square footage, and natural light. But the comparison is problematic when more is known about one option than the other-Apartment A has hardwood floors, for example, but nothing is known about the flooring in Apartment B.</p><p>"It's a problem in decision making, because people are driven to make decisions by comparing feature-by-feature," said Mather, who wanted to know how people cognitively cope with the gaps.</p><p>It turns out that adults of all ages tend to falsely fill in the gaps and then remember circumstances as being "more alignable" than they were. For instance, in the rental example, the tenant might "fill in the gap" by inferring that Apartment B had carpets and go on to recall that incorrect information later.</p><p>"People remember features that can be compared more than those that can't be aligned, and they make inferences that fill in the blanks and that contrast with the other information," she said. "Alignability helps memory but also leads to false memories." </p><p>In another experiment, Mather explored emotion's powerful impact on memory and found that older adults with high cognitive functioning use a decision-making strategy that generates more positive emotional outcomes.</p><p>These older adults tend to favor the feature-by-feature decision-making process because it guards against regret. By contrast, younger adults are more likely to employ what psychologists call the "whole option" strategy, in which they consider both the negative and positive aspects of each option before examining the next option. "Young people are trying to learn as much as they can about each option, while older people are more focused on feeling good about their choices," said Mather. </p><p>Mather found that in general, adults aged 65 to 80 tend to initially ignore negative features--and to remember them less--than younger adults. Elders also remember more positive features than negative, compared to younger adults, she said.</p><p>Researchers previously have attributed most age differences to cognitive decline, said Mather. But in this study, Mather's team tested older adults for their cognitive abilities, and those with the best performance on tests of working memory and other complex tasks were most likely to use different strategies than the younger adults. </p><p>"This pattern suggests that younger and older adults' comparison processes are influenced by different goals," she said. "Even when older adults show little or no signs of cognitive decline, they make decisions differently than younger adults, in ways that should help them avoid regret."</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Mara Mather may be reached at (831) 459-3819 or mather@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e808b8072704601a012ff605029e0"><name>636</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Department establishes new student-run production company</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1107846000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz Theater...</display-name><path>/2005/02/636</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/02/636</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338095190</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338095190</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Department has established a new student-run production company to help ease the transition for undergraduates from academia to the professional theater world. </p><p>	</p><p>Named "Barnstorm" because of its home base in the Barn Theater at the foot of the UCSC campus, it has been created as a model of a small professional theater company-completely organized and managed by students.	Participants receive five units of academic credit and must put in a minimum of 150 hours each quarter working in one particular area such as an actor, director, publicist, or set designer.  </p><p> 	</p><p>"Barnstorm allows the students to run their own theater company in the barn," noted Danny Scheie, chair of the UCSC Theater Arts Department. "It gives the students a chance to have a legitimate avant-garde theater and run it how they want--the dream of every artist on the Lower East Side, but a financial impossibility for artists in the real world." </p><p>Now in its second quarter, Barnstorm is still a work-in-progress. During its premier quarter last fall, the company presented two productions of previously published works (Revenge of the Space Pandas by David Mamet and Fat Men in Skirts by Nicky Silver), plus three staged readings of original student work, and a variety of short-run performances that included improvisational comedy and live-action episodes of television shows. </p><p>"We teach students how to be professional practitioners," observed Mike McCann, the company's managing director and a UCSC graduate student in theater arts. "We give students an opportunity to see what life would be like in an actual company where there's an artistic director, a marketing team, a technical director, and various other positions."</p><p>McCann said the goal during this first year is to create the framework of the company and have three productions running in repertory by spring quarter.</p><p> "We're thinking on a company level instead of just looking at one specific show," he explained. "For example, the marketing people must learn to consistently look ahead to promote future shows in repertory. And the set designers need to build in such a way that a set can be easily removed for the comedy group that will come in afterward."</p><p> Barnstorm hosts a number of workshops such as 24/7, where students have just 24 hours to conceive, write, rehearse, and perform a seven-minute play--the event begins at 9 p.m. on a Saturday night and the plays are all performed by 9 p.m. on Sunday. It also presents weekly Syndication/Vindication nights, offering Santa Cruz-based soap operas such as 90210 in 95064 and All My Kresge Children. A revolving team of writers create the episodes, and the directors change every week. "We were turning people away by the end of last quarter," McCann noted.</p><p>Although some students have been able to take advantage of the proximity of Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC)-the professional theater company housed at UCSC-positions available to students have generally been limited by the very fact that SSC is a professional company. Students also must currently compete for a limited number of spots to present original productions through the Theater Arts Department.</p><p>"Barnstorm is filling a huge need," noted Leah Gardner, Barnstorm's artistic director and also a UCSC theater arts graduate student. "We have at least two or three events every week. And I would say that probably 25 out of 30 days in any month there's something going on in the Barn-whether a performance or a rehearsal of a production. There are so many students who want their voices to be heard and their art to be seen."</p><p>Gardner added that another goal of Barnstorm is to help build bridges between theater arts and other departments in the UCSC Arts Division.</p><p> "We would like to have art students use the lobby of the Barn Theater as a gallery space, have film students show their short films, and have music students write themes for the soap operas or songs for a musical," Gardner said. "We ultimately want to make the Barn available for all students, not just those in theater arts."</p><p>_____</p><p>For more information about Barnstorm, call (831) 459-4001 or contact by e-mail at: barnstorm@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e81f58072704601a012ff0fee91a6"><name>637</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz chancellor hosted by Korean consul general</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1108105200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz chancellor...</display-name><path>/2005/02/637</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/02/637</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338095541</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338095541</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Chancellor Denice D. Denton underscored her value for UCSC's international perspective at a recent dinner hosted by the Korean Consul General in San Jose. </p><p>Designed to brief the Korean media and business community about the upcoming Pacific Rim Music Festival at UCSC in May, the event was part of an ongoing effort to promote cultural collaborations between the campus and Korea.</p><p>"Creativity flourishes in diverse environments where there are adequate opportunities for cross-cultural exchange," Denton noted in her opening remarks at the dinner. "Fostering stronger ties with the international community and building UCSC's global perspective is one of my top priorities as incoming chancellor."</p><p>Denton added that initiatives like the Pacific Rim Music Festival and a proposed UCSC Center for Pacific Rim Music and Culture are key examples of how the campus can benefit from its strategic location on the Pacific Rim next to the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley-major centers for international commerce and the arts. </p><p>The dinner was attended by a number of CEOs from the Korean press, radio, and television, as well as such business leaders as the president of the Korean-American Chamber of Commerce in Silicon Valley and the president of the Korean Industry Network. UCSC was represented by Hi Kyung Kim, associate professor of music and artistic director of the Pacific Rim Music Festival; David Evan Jones, Porter College Provost and professor of music; Ron Suduiko, vice chancellor of University Relations; and Steve Kang, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. </p><p>"A new wave of musicians, composers, and artists grounded in the music and art of their own Asian cultures is invigorating and shaping what was previously considered the music of the West," Jones said in his brief address to the assembled guests.  "At the same time, European and American composers are seeking influence in ever more fundamental ways from the rich and diverse cultural traditions of Asia."</p><p> </p><p>Jones, who traveled to Korea last spring to hear his own opera performed in Seoul, observed that the UCSC Music Department offers an unusually diverse curriculum with an important focus on the study of world music. He noted that Santa Cruz recently became the first UC campus to offer a doctorate in music composition with a specialty focusing on indigenous non-Western composers. </p><p>"Americans have a great deal to learn from Korean attitudes toward culture and, indeed, a great deal to learn from Korean culture itself," said Jones. "It is very important--not only for Korean-Americans but for all Americans--that traditional Korean culture be prominently represented in our universities."</p><p>Engineering dean Kang additionally spoke about his personal pride as a Korean-American in seeing Korean traditions being presented and celebrated on an American campus.</p><p>The 2005 Pacific Rim Festival will take place at UCSC from April 29 through May 7. It will include a new composition by artistic director Hi Kyung Kim, who is internationally known for incorporating Western classical music with traditional techniques and instruments from her native Korea.

<p>The work of dancer/choreographer Trisha Brown is well known for its lack of respect for the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Throughout Brown's artistic career that has spanned more than three decades, her dancers have literally walked on walls and down the faces of buildings. Twisting in midair, they have climbed up and down each other in simulation of a spiral staircase. As the Seattle Times noted in a recent review, "entire dancers abandoned the earth for what felt like extended periods of time during" during the U.S. premiere of her piece, "Present Tense."</p>
<p>The Trisha Brown Dance Company will perform "Present Tense" along with two other dynamic works on Wednesday, February 23, at the Henry Mello Center in Watsonville. The show begins at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>"Trisha Brown is quite famous for her gravity-defying choreography," noted UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures production coordinator Moon Rinaldo. "'Present Tense' uses daring aerial choreography, which is essentially borrowed from the circus. Suspended in space, her dancers seem to come out of thin air."</p>
<p>Brown's company will also perform "Groove and Countermove," a mesmerizing homage to jazz, and "Geometry of Quiet," a piece lauded by the Village Voice for the "calm austerity" that "pervades her stunning new dance."</p>
<p>"In 'Groove and Countermove,' the dancers are each dressed in a solid color so that together they form a full-spectrum rainbow," said Rinaldo. "As they come together and split apart, it's as though they are embodying the paths of refracted light falling over the stage."</p>
<p>The first woman to receive a coveted MacArthur Foundation "genius" award, Brown became one of the leaders of New York's experimental Judson Dance Theater in the 1960s--a revolutionary movement that changed modern dance forever. After forming the Trisha Brown Dance Company in 1970, she began collaborating with such artists as Robert Rauschenberg, Laurie Anderson, Nancy Graves, Fujiko Nakaya, and John Cage.</p>
<p>In 1987, Brown received both a Dance Magazine award for "25 Years of Sustained Innovations" and the Laurence Olivier Award for "Most Outstanding Achievement in Dance." Brown was inducted as an Honorary Member of the Academy of Arts and Letters in 1997.</p>
<p>The Trisha Brown Dance Company can be found performing regularly at the landmark opera houses of New York, Paris, and London, as well as numerous theaters throughout the world.</p>
<p>"Brown is really the queen of postmodern dance-she was integral to defining the American avant-garde movement and her style has stood the test of time," said Rinaldo. "Her choreography is quintessential sixties cool-elegantly minimal and poetic in an urban sort of way."</p>

<p>Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are very short blasts of gamma rays, lasting about one millisecond, that are emitted into space from Earth's upper atmosphere. The gamma rays are thought to be emitted by electrons traveling at near the speed of light when they scatter off of atoms and decelerate in the upper atmosphere. TGFs were first discovered in 1994 by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory.</p>
<p>BATSE could only detect TGFs in a special observing mode and was limited in its ability to count them or measure their peak energies. New observations from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite raise the maximum recorded energy of TGFs by a factor of ten and indicate that the Earth gives off about 50 TGFs every day, and possibly many more. The findings are reported in the February 18 issue of Science by a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, and the University of British Columbia (UBC).</p>
<p>"The idea that the Earth, a fairly small and tame planet, can be an accelerator of particles to ultrarelativistic energies is fascinating to me," said David Smith, an assistant professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the paper.</p>
<p>"The energies we see are as high as those of gamma rays emitted from black holes and neutron stars," Smith said.</p>
<p>The exact mechanism that accelerates the electron beams to produce TGFs is still uncertain, he said, but it probably involves the build-up of electric charge at the tops of thunder clouds due to lightning discharges, resulting in a powerful electric field between the cloudtops and the ionosphere, the outer layer of Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Regardless of the exact mechanism, there is some enormous particle accelerator in the upper atmosphere that is accelerating electrons to these very high energies, so they emit gamma rays when they hit the sparse atoms of the upper atmosphere," Smith said. "What's exciting is that we are now getting data good enough for the theorists to really test their models."</p>
<p>TGFs have been correlated with lightning strikes and may be related to visible phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere over thunderstorms, such as red sprites and blue jets. Just how these various phenomena are related is a question the RHESSI investigators plan to pursue in collaboration with other researchers around the world, Smith said.</p>
<p>The Science paper presents the first analysis of RHESSI data for TGFs. RHESSI, a NASA Small Explorer spacecraft, was launched in 2002 to study x-rays and gamma-rays from solar flares. But RHESSI's detectors pick up gamma rays from a variety of sources. Smith worked with RHESSI principal investigator Robert Lin at UC Berkeley and Christopher Barrington-Leigh, now at UBC, to plan ways they could use the satellite for a range of investigations in addition to studying solar flares.</p>
<p>Liliana Lopez, a UC Berkeley undergraduate, has been working with Smith to analyze the RHESSI data for TGFs. The Science paper presents the results from a search of three months of RHESSI data, and the analysis of additional data is ongoing.</p>
<p>The authors estimated a global average rate of about 50 TGFs a day, but the rate could be up to 100 times higher if, as some models indicate, TGFs are emitted as narrowly focused beams that would only be detected when the satellite is directly in their path.</p>
<p>The duration of TGFs recorded by RHESSI ranged from 0.2 to 3.5 milliseconds. The most energetic TGF photons detected by RHESSI were in the range of 10 to 20 million electron volts (10-20 MeV), or about 300 times as energetic as medical x-rays. The electrons that emitted these gamma rays would have been traveling at 99.99 percent of the speed of light, with energies on the order of 35 MeV.</p>
<p>The findings raise many interesting questions, including whether the electrons that emit TGFs ultimately contribute to the high-energy electrons in Earth's radiation belts, Smith said. "This is a very interesting process involving extreme physics right here on Earth, and if we can understand the process here it might give us insights into similar processes in less accessible parts of the universe."</p>

But this aspect of science rarely makes it into the classroom, where students spend a lot more time on established facts and concepts than on the messy process by which those facts and concepts get established.</p>
<p>That's unfortunate, because being able to evaluate conflicts and inconsistencies in scientific findings is a very useful skill for students to develop, according to Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"Even if you're not a researcher, it is helpful to have a researcher's mentality when you are trying to evaluate all the conflicting information that comes at you these days from different sources," said Ares, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute professor.</p>
<p>"We want to create lifelong learners and thinkers who can take information that doesn't add up and make sense of it," he said.</p>
<p>Ares has developed a teaching exercise for undergraduate biology classes to give students a sense of how scientists proceed when valid data appear to conflict. In the course of the exercise, the students work together to resolve the apparent conflicts, while at the same time learning important concepts in molecular biology.</p>
<p>Ares described this teaching exercise and his experiences using it in the classroom at a symposium on science education on Sunday, February 20, at the 2005 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The exercise involves laboratory experiments to test for interactions involving certain proteins in yeast. The students also do a literature search for related information and present their findings in class. Ares chose a system in which conflicts and inconsistencies are published in the literature, and as the students present their findings they use diagrams to develop a model of the system that incorporates all the results.</p>
<p>"In addition to teaching the students about protein-protein interactions, this exercise seems to give students a sense of the processes scientists use to incorporate individual findings into viable intellectual constructs for understanding how biological systems work," Ares said.</p>
<p>This is just one example of the novel approaches to teaching science that Ares is developing in an experimental undergraduate research laboratory he established at UC Santa Cruz in 2002 with support from the HHMI Professors program. He developed the protein interaction exercise during his work with students in the undergraduate research laboratory and subsequently tested and evaluated it in a regular biology class.</p>
<p>Another idea Ares has been exploring in his experimental teaching laboratory is how to cultivate interdisciplinary thinking in undergraduates. His thoughts on this subject can be found in a commentary published in the December 2004 issue of Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology.</p>
<p>"The seeds of disciplinary entrenchment are sown in undergraduate classrooms," Ares wrote.</p>
<p>His undergraduate research laboratory brings together students from different majors to learn about genomics by carrying out their own research projects in small groups. The 1,200-square-foot teaching lab features a wet lab and specialized equipment for molecular biology, as well as a bench loaded with computer equipment, including a dedicated network server for bioinformatics work. Computer science and bioinformatics majors work together with molecular, cell, and developmental biology majors.</p>
<p>Ares said he hopes to break down the cultural barriers between undergraduate majors, encourage students to think outside the disciplinary boundaries of their majors, and prepare them to be effective collaborators in the cutting-edge interdisciplinary research of the future.</p>
<p>"In interdisciplinary research, it may be more important to know simply how to communicate with someone in another discipline than to know that discipline intimately," he said.</p>

The symposium, organized by Steven Berkeley of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Larry Crowder of Duke University Marine Laboratory, was part of the 2005 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). </p><p>"Much of what we now know about fish populations is not being accounted for in current fisheries management," said Berkeley, a research biologist at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory. </p><p>Berkeley's research on West Coast rockfish, for example, shows that large, old females are far more important than younger fish in maintaining productive fisheries. The larvae produced by these "big, old, fat females" grow faster, resist starvation better, and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish. Unfortunately, older fish tend to disappear under current fisheries management practices--the old fish get caught and the younger fish never have a chance to grow old.</p><p>"Our research shows that you need to maintain older fish in the population because those are the most successful at reproducing. But normal fishing at what we now think of as safe levels will not maintain old fish in the population," Berkeley said. </p><p>The effects of fishing on the age structure of a population is particularly striking in the various species of rockfish, which are very long-lived fish. Many rockfish can live for 50 years or more, and some species can live well over 100 years. </p><p>Current fisheries management actually aims to reduce the number of old, slow-growing fish in the population, leaving more room and resources for younger, faster-growing fish. Most marine fish produce huge numbers of eggs and larvae, so the assumption has been that the spawners that remain after harvesting will produce plenty of larvae to replenish the population. According to Berkeley, however, elimination of older generations drastically reduces the ability of the population to replenish itself. </p><p>Failure to account for the role of older fish in maintaining healthy populations may help explain the recent collapse of some major West Coast fisheries. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has declared several stocks of groundfish--a group that includes numerous species of rockfish and other bottom-dwelling fish--to be overfished. Tight restrictions were imposed to allow the overfished populations to recover, causing economic hardship for many in the West Coast fishing industry. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades. </p><p>One way to prevent such problems may be to establish marine reserves--areas where fishing is not allowed and fish populations are able to age naturally. </p><p>"Marine reserves are the only good way of protecting the full age structure of a population of fish, so that at least some of the population ages naturally," Berkeley said. "There may be other approaches, but no matter how you manage the fishery, you can't have a full complement of age classes unless some part of the population is off limits."</p><p>Other research presented at the symposium includes new findings about genetically distinct populations within the geographic ranges of some marine fish species, as well as evidence that successful breeders may be few and far between in some populations. These and other findings further undermine fundamental assumptions of current fisheries management, Berkeley said. "These are all things that should make us stop and think about how we manage fisheries," he said. </p><p>Berkeley and his collaborators have published recent papers on their research and its implications for fisheries management. Findings on the influence of maternal age on larval growth and survival appeared in the May 2004 issue of Ecology. Management implications of these and other findings were discussed in a paper in the August 2004 issue of Fisheries. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Berkeley at (831) 459-3530 or stevenab@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e89c68072704601a012ffacb01aee"><name>642</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book documents first statewide civil rights movement in Florida</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1109574000000</start-date><display-name>New book documents first...</display-name><path>/2005/02/642</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/02/642</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338097556</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338097556</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Decades before the Montgomery bus boycott, African Americans in Jacksonville, Florida, organized streetcar boycotts that forced the city to abandon efforts to segregate the system. </p><p>	That little-known act of rebellion is one of many instances of African Americans organizing against white supremacy that historian Paul Ortiz, an assistant professor of community studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, documents in his new book, Emancipation Betrayed.</p><p>	Handed down within black families but unknown among historians, the story of black resistance in Florida from Reconstruction until the bloody election of 1920 is an inspiring chapter of U.S. history. Written for a general audience, Emancipation Betrayed focuses on the African American struggle for voting rights while documenting networks of secret societies, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and churches that black Floridians relied on to organize and sustain themselves in the state with the highest lynching rate in the country.</p><p>	"They created the first statewide civil rights movement in U.S. history," said Ortiz. "This book is really about what happens when people are faced with political terrorism--how they challenge that and find the courage and self-confidence needed to put together a social movement."</p><p>	Through oral histories, Ortiz learned about the courageous actions of African Americans who fought for their rights, often at enormous risk to themselves and their families. Sam Dixie, an octogenarian, told of blacks taking up arms in self-defense and shared his childhood memories of a shootout in his hometown of Quincy between blacks and the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan had found out about a secret oath taken by members of the Colored Knights of Pythias, a black fraternal organization, to fight for their rights, and Klansmen burned the lodge and killed several knights during the shootout.</p><p>	That memory was the catalyst that "completely changed my understanding of American history and social change," wrote Ortiz in the preface to Emancipation Betrayed: The Hidden History of Black Organizing and White Violence in Florida from Reconstruction to the Bloody Election of 1920 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005).</p><p>	Ortiz described going "back and back" in time, picking up threads of resistance. "We are not taught to see African Americans as protagonists fighting for their own rights, but that's exactly what these people did," he said. </p><p>	Black Floridians found inspiration in the activism of their parents and grandparents. In 1901 and 1905, black residents of Jacksonville organized boycotts that forced the city to abandon efforts to segregate the streetcar system. (The system was ultimately segregated, however, with the intervention of the state legislature.) "In the long term, these organizing campaigns taught African Americans how to challenge the system," said Ortiz.</p><p>	The Colored Knights of Pythias, which at one point claimed one in six African American men in Florida as members, was a vital avenue for organizing, according to Ortiz. After World War I, the knights passed a resolution requiring each member to pay his poll tax and register to vote before the 1920 election or face expulsion. Churches and other organizations promptly followed suit. Years of organizing culminated with the 1920 presidential election in Florida, when the state sanctioned white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan to use violence to prevent blacks from voting. Between 30 and 60 African Americans were killed, according to cautious estimates by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and scores were wounded and displaced. Despite copious evidence of political terror presented during a congressional investigation, the election results were certified. The Florida movement was defeated.</p><p>	Despite the tragic outcome, the legacy of early black activism in Florida is a powerful one. With roots in the days of slavery, it set the stage for the civil rights movement of the 1960s, said Ortiz. "Black Floridians' courageous struggle for emancipation established the grounds for our modern expectation that all adults in the United States have the right to vote," he said. "This is a brutal part of our history, but we are the beneficiaries of their struggle and sacrifice."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to Journalists: Paul Ortiz may be reached at (831) 459-5583 or via e-mail at portiz@ucsc.edu. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e8b2e8072704601a012ff11c7894b"><name>643</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ocean scientist Mary Silver to give annual Faculty Research Lecture at UCSC on Thursday, March 10</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1109574000000</start-date><display-name>Ocean scientist Mary Silver...</display-name><path>/2005/02/643</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/02/643</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338097898</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338097898</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Professor of ocean sciences Mary Silver will give the annual Faculty Research Lecture at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on Thursday, March 10. Her lecture, titled "A Naturalist's View: Toxic Algae in the Coastal Ocean," will begin at 8 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the public. A reception will be held at the University Center after the lecture.</p><p>An internationally recognized leader in biological oceanography, Silver has been highly influential through her research and teaching. Her findings have affected research directions for the entire field of oceanography and have often caused the oceanographic community to rethink and change the prevailing wisdom of the time.</p><p>In recent years, Silver has been studying one of the most pressing issues of ocean health: harmful algal blooms caused by toxin-producing marine phytoplankton (microscopic algae). When other organisms eat the toxic algae, the toxins can move through the marine food web, poisoning marine mammals and seabirds and accumulating in fish and shellfish that may be harvested for human consumption. This issue is receiving increased attention because of growing human populations near the coasts, increasing human consumption of marine food sources, and more frequent and widespread occurrence of harmful algal blooms. </p><p>Silver's research on harmful algal blooms focuses on determining the environmental conditions that lead to toxin production by phytoplankton and understanding the pathways by which these toxins are transmitted to higher organisms, including humans. </p><p>Silver joined the UCSC faculty in 1972, and she was a founding member and leading developer of the campus's highly respected program in ocean sciences. She is probably best known for her studies of "marine snow" that began in the mid-1970s. The small flocs and flakes of nonliving particles that drift down through the water like snow had been ignored by other scientists until Silver decided to take a close look at them. She showed that marine snow is a major source of sinking organic matter in the world's oceans and that it is the site of intense microbial activity. </p><p>Silver's findings on marine snow had a major impact on the basic understanding of the way that decomposition and nutrient regeneration processes occur in the ocean and the ways in which microbial populations interact. This work resulted in the first estimates of the abundance of marine snow and the communities of microorganisms that inhabit it. It also showed that many planktonic organisms thought to be "free-living" actually reside on particles. Because these organisms are abundant and active, the particles are actually semi-isolated microhabitats for dense and unique microbial communities. </p><p>"Silver's collective body of work on marine snow stands out as one of the great individual contributions in modern biological oceanography," wrote the committee of the UCSC Academic Senate that recommended her as this year's Faculty Research Lecturer.</p><p>Silver has received many awards and honors in recognition of her accomplishments, including the Mary Sears Woman Pioneer in Oceanography Award in 2002 and the Henry Bryant Bigelow Award in Oceanography in 1992, both awarded by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She received the 1995-96 Outstanding Faculty Award from UCSC's Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, was elected as a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences in 1997, and was selected by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to give the 2001 Ricketts Memorial Lecture. </p><p>A popular teacher, Silver has taught well over 4,000 students in her years at UCSC and has sponsored and encouraged many young marine biologists and oceanographers.

On February 13, the disc won a 2005 Grammy Award for "Best Pop Instrumental Album" from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
<p>Released on the Solid Air Records label, the CD features a number of top acoustic fingerstyle guitarists performing a collection of tunes by Henry Mancini--the great composer/conductor/arranger who died in 1994. An icon of film and television music, Mancini was nominated for 72 Grammys and 18 Academy Awards. He won four Oscars for such tunes as the "Pink Panther Theme," "Moon River," "Days of Wine and Roses," and "Peter Gunn."</p>
<p>"I'm excited, flattered, and honored to be on it," said Coulter by phone from a Music Department studio where he also works as the campus recording technician. "What's odd is that it was music that I don't normally play; I mostly play classical and traditional folk music, so doing a pop song was new for me. But I enjoyed the challenge."</p>
<p>"I never thought it would win," Coulter added. "It was up against a tribute album to Luther Vandross."</p>
<p>Coulter was contacted for the project by Solid Air Records, a label he had recorded for in the past. They sent him a list of Mancini songs to choose from, but it turned out that his first choice, "Moon River," was already taken. The label's producer suggested instead "Baby Elephant Walk," a tune from the 1962 Howard Hawks adventure/comedy film Hatari starring John Wayne.</p>
<p>"I had never actually heard the tune before," said Coulter. "So I got a couple of versions to listen to and came up with an arrangement that fit. I enjoyed doing it; it took maybe a week."</p>
<p>Coulter added that Solid Air also released a DVD and book containing the music for all the tunes on the CD, plus a five-minute mini-lesson from each artist about his song.</p>
<p>"I recorded the whole thing-both the tune and the lesson-in my backyard studio," Coulter said. I also wound up using different parts of the tune in my teaching."</p>
<p>Coulter began teaching on campus in 1995 after earning a master's degree from UCSC in ethnomusicology with an emphasis on traditional Irish music, language, and song. He will celebrate the release of his latest CD, The Road Home, at a March 19 concert to be held at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center. The event, presented by his record label, Gourd Music, will feature Coulter on guitar plus Barry Phillips (cello, tabla), Shelley Phillips (harp, winds), Lars Johannesson (flute), Neal Hellman (dulcimer), and Deby Benton Grosjean (fiddle).</p>
<p>Coulter's new CD includes pieces from Ireland, Brittany, Norway, Portugal, and America, as well as a number of original compositions and a solo arrangement of Neil Young's "After the Gold Rush." The recording concludes with the title cut, "The Road Home," a track composed on the Irish whistle by McHenry Library reference specialist Laura McClanathan, and named by Coulter's son, Evan.</p>
<p>The Road Home and tickets to the March 19 Kuumbwa show are both available at Gourd Music: <a href="http://www.gourd.com">www.gourd.com</a> or by calling (831) 425-4939.
