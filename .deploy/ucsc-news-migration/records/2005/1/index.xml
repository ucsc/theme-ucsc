She credited her time studying at UCSC as an important milestone in her life because the campus had accepted her as an "older" re-entry student in 1974, paving the way for her future success.</p><p>The gift brings UCSC closer to its <a href="http://giveto.ucsc.edu/campaign.asp">Cornerstone Campaign</a> goal of raising $50 million by June of 2005. The campus has raised $45 million to date and hopes to bring in $5 million of the grand total specifically for student scholarships, fellowships, and research grants. Prior to this donation, more than $3 million had already been raised for student support, including $1.5 million generated from two highly successful Scholarships Benefit Dinners.</p><p>"This extraordinary gift will eventually have a huge impact on UCSC students," said Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers, "as it will ensure state-of-the-art library facilities and provide significant support for re-entry students with scholarships and child care." </p><p>"This is an exemplary act of leadership by a UCSC Foundation trustee who is also an alumna, underscoring the philanthropic maturity of UCSC's founding cohort of students," Chemers added.</p><p>Mura-smith graduated from UCSC in 1975 with a degree in applied social anthropology. Three years later, while attending law school and working for Hewlett-Packard, she and three partners purchased technology from her employer to found their own company in Sunnyvale called Trimble Navigation. The firm became a leader in Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology, with applications in fields as diverse as marine navigation, land survey, mobile communication, aerospace, geographic information systems, and personal navigation. </p><p> Now retired, Mura-smith held executive positions in marketing, product development and manufacturing operations at the company, in addition to heading the original marine business. She also became the co-owner of three patents, including a battery-powered GPS navigation wristwear device. Mura-smith is married to artist and former rock musician John Ware, and they now reside in Denver.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e69168072704601a012ffad2903c2"><name>621</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New view of distant colliding galaxies captured by Keck laser system</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1105513200000</start-date><display-name>New view of distant...</display-name><path>/2005/01/621</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/01/621</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338089135</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338089135</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For the first time, astronomers have been able to combine the deepest optical images of the universe, obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope, with equally sharp images in the near-infrared part of the spectrum using a sophisticated new laser guide star system for adaptive optics at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The new observations, presented at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in San Diego this week, reveal unprecedented details of colliding galaxies with massive black holes at their cores, seen at a distance of around 5 billion light-years. </p><p> </p><p>Observing distant galaxies in the infrared range reveals older populations of stars than can be seen at optical wavelengths, and infrared light also penetrates clouds of interstellar dust more readily than optical light. The new infrared images of distant galaxies were obtained by a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, UCLA, and the Keck Observatory. Jason Melbourne, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the study, said the initial findings include some surprises and that researchers will continue to analyze the data in the weeks to come. </p><p> </p><p>"This is very exciting, because we have never been able to achieve this level of spatial resolution in the infrared before," Melbourne said.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to Melbourne, the research team, led by David Koo of UCSC and James Larkin of UCLA, includes Jennifer Lotz, Claire Max, and Jerry Nelson at UCSC; Shelley Wright and Matthew Barczys at UCLA; and Antonin H. Bouchez, Jason Chin, Scott Hartman, Erik Johansson, Robert Lafon, David Le Mignant, Paul J. Stomski, Douglas Summers, Marcos A. van Dam, and Peter L. Wizinowich at Keck Observatory. </p><p> </p><p>"For the first time now in these deepest images of the universe we can cover all wavelengths of light from the optical to the infrared with the same level of spatial resolution, which allows us to observe detailed substructures in distant galaxies and study their constituent stars with a precision we couldn't possibly obtain otherwise," said Koo, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p><p> </p><p>The images were obtained by Wright and the Keck AO team during testing of the laser guide star adaptive optics system on the 10-meter Keck II Telescope. They are the first science-quality images of distant galaxies obtained with the new system. This marks a major step for the Center for Adaptive Optics Treasury Survey (CATS), which will use adaptive optics to observe a large sample of faint, distant galaxies in the early universe, said UCLA's Larkin.</p><p> </p><p>"We've worked very hard for several years taking data around bright stars. But we have been very restricted in terms of the number and types of objects that we can observe. Only with the laser can we now reach the richest and most exciting targets, especially those with beautiful optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope," Larkin said. </p><p> </p><p>Adaptive optics (AO) corrects for the blurring effect of the atmosphere, which seriously degrades images seen by ground-based telescopes. An AO system precisely measures this blurring and corrects the image using a deformable mirror, applying corrections hundreds of times per second. To measure the blurring, AO requires a bright point-source of light in the telescope's field of view, which can be created artificially by using a laser to excite sodium atoms in the upper atmosphere, causing them to glow. Without such a laser guide star, astronomers have had to rely on bright stars ("natural guide stars"), which drastically limits where AO can be used in the sky. Furthermore, natural guide stars are too bright to allow observations of very faint, distant galaxies in the same part of the sky, Koo said.</p><p> </p><p>"The advent of the laser guide star at Keck has opened up the sky for adaptive optics observations, and we can now use Keck to focus on those fields where we already have wonderful, deep optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope," Koo said.</p><p> </p><p>Because the diameter of the Keck Telescope's mirror is four times larger than Hubble's, it can obtain images four times sharper than Hubble in the near infrared now that the laser guide star adaptive optics system is available to overcome the blurring effects of the atmosphere.</p><p> </p><p>The images being presented at the AAS meeting were obtained in an area of the sky known as the GOODS-South field, where deep observations have already been made by Hubble, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and other telescopes. There are six faint galaxies in the images, including two x-ray sources identified by Chandra. The x-ray emissions, combined with the disordered morphology of these objects, suggested recent merger activity, Melbourne said. Mergers can funnel large amounts of matter into the center of a galaxy, and x-ray emissions from the galactic center indicate the presence of a massive black hole that is actively consuming matter.</p><p> </p><p>"We are now fairly certain that we are seeing galaxies that have undergone recent mergers," Melbourne said. "One of these systems has a double nucleus, so you can actually see the two nuclei of the merging galaxies. The other system is highly disordered--it looks like a train wreck--and is a much stronger x-ray source." </p><p> </p><p>In addition to lighting up the galactic nucleus with x-ray emissions, mergers also tend to trigger the formation of new stars by shocking and compressing clouds of gas. So the researchers were surprised to find that the system with a double nucleus is dominated by relatively old stars and does not appear to be producing many young stars.</p><p> </p><p>"If we are right about the merger scenario, then this merger is occuring between two galaxies that had already formed most of their stars billions of years before and did not have a lot of gas left over to make new stars," Melbourne said. </p><p> </p><p>If additional study shows that such objects are common further back in time, these observations could help explain one of the puzzles of galaxy formation. According to the prevailing theory of hierarchical galaxy formation, large galaxies are built up over billions of years through mergers between smaller galaxies. Since mergers trigger star formation, it has been difficult to explain the existence of very large galaxies that lack significant populations of young stars.</p><p> </p><p>"One idea is that you can have a so-called dry merger, where two galaxies full of old stars but little gas merge without forming many new stars. What we are seeing in this object is consistent with a dry merger," Melbourne said. "Even in a dry merger, there may still be enough gas to feed the black hole, producing x-ray emissions, but not enough to yield a strong burst of star formation."</p><p> </p><p>Further observations at mid- to far-infrared wavelengths, expected later this year from the Spitzer Space Telescope, may help confirm this. The Spitzer data will provide a better indication of the dust content of the galaxy, a crucial variable in interpreting these observations, Melbourne said.</p><p> </p><p>The laser guide star adaptive optics system was funded by the W. M. Keck Foundation. The artificial laser guide star system was developed and integrated in a partnership between the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the W. M. Keck Observatory. The laser was integrated at Keck with the help of Dee Pennington, Curtis Brown, and Pam Danforth. The NIRC2 near-infrared camera was developed by the California Institute of Technology, UCLA, and the Keck observatory. The Keck Observatory is operated as a scientific partnership among CalTech, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. </p><p> </p><p>This work has been supported by the Center for Adaptive Optics, a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center managed by UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Melbourne at (831) 459-5891 or jmel@ucolick.org; Koo at (831) 459-2130 or koo@ucolick.org; Larkin at larkin@astro.ucla.edu; and Wright at saw@astro.ucla.edu.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/">www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e6ab28072704601a012ff90532170"><name>622</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz hosts American Indian colloquium series&#13;

Susan Hough, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist, will speak on "The Very Long Reach of Very Large Earthquakes" on Wednesday, January 26, at 7 p.m. at the University Inn and Conference Center, 611 Ocean St., in Santa Cruz. Preceding her talk, from 6:30 to 7 p.m., UCSC scientists will answer questions from the audience about recent events in South Asia. Admission is free, and doors will open at 6 p.m.</p><p>The magnitude 9.0 Sumatra earthquake on December 26, 2004, showed the tremendous "reach" of very large earthquakes. In addition to the devastating tsunami, this earthquake generated enormously powerful waves within the Earth. Recently, scientists have learned that waves from large earthquakes may disturb faults in distant regions and cause "triggered earthquakes." Might the Sumatra earthquake generate similar triggered events around the globe? Hough will discuss this possibility and other implications of her research.</p><p>Hough's talk, sponsored by the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth (CSIDE) at UC Santa Cruz, is part of the Distinguished Lecture Series of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology and the Seismological Society of America. </p><p>A USGS seismologist since 1992, Hough is editor-in-chief of Seismological Research Letters. Her research interests include the nature of ground shaking produced by large earthquakes, historic earthquakes (the 1811-12 New Madrid earthquakes in particular), earthquakes and earthquake hazard in India, and remotely triggered earthquakes.</p><p>Hough has published two books on earthquake science for the nonspecialist audience: Earthshaking Science: What We Know (and Don't Know) about Earthquakes, and Finding Fault in California: An Earthquake Tourist's Guide. A third book, Elastic Rebound: Past and future Earthquakes on an Urban Planet (by Susan Hough and Roger Bilham), is scheduled for publication this year. Hough has also published several feature articles in magazines such as Natural History and American Scientist.</p><p>CSIDE, which is hosting Hough's lecture, is part of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at UCSC. CSIDE integrates UCSC expertise on dynamical processes within the Earth and imaging of the manifestations of those processes. Research is directed at quantifying the complex structures and interactions of Earth systems, ranging from Earth's core to the surface environment. CSIDE director Susan Schwartz, a professor of Earth sciences and director of the Keck Seismology Laboratory at UCSC, will join other UCSC experts on earthquakes and tsunamis to answer questions before Hough's talk. Thorne Lay, IGPP director and professor of Earth sciences at UCSC, and research geophysicist Steven Ward are expected to join Schwartz. </p><p>For more information about this public lecture, contact Jennifer Fish at (831) 459-1235.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e6de78072704601a012ff2d7015ed"><name>624</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Library's Regional History Project announces completion of agricultural history series</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1105599600000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Library's Regional History...</display-name><path>/2005/01/624</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/01/624</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338090402</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338090402</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Library's Regional History Project has just published seven oral histories to complete a series focusing on the ethnic and agricultural history of Santa Cruz County. </p><p>All of the interviews were conducted in 1977 by oral historians Randall Jarrell and Meri Knaster, and were edited by Irene Reti, the current director of the Regional History Project.

Frank Barba: Filipino Labor Contractor, Watsonville, California, 1898-1977.</p><p>Frank Barba's narrative is a significant contribution to the history of agriculture and to the history of Filipino immigration in Santa Cruz County. Born in 1898 in San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, on the largest of the Philippine islands, he came to Watsonville in 1927 to take over the management of a Filipino labor camp that had already been established by his aunt. He worked as a labor contractor from 1927, at first independently, and then for the Birbeck Company of Aromas, which grew lettuce, string beans, broccoli, and sugar beets. At the time of this interview in 1977, Barba was 78 years old and semi-retired, supervising schoolchildren in the fields for various growers in the area. </p><p>. Porter Chaffee: Labor Organizer and Activist, 1900-1977</p><p>Porter Chaffee's oral history offers valuable primary source documentation on the labor struggles of the 1930s, particularly from the point of view of a Communist labor activist and WPA writer. He wrote for the leftist New Masses magazine and composed an unpublished memoir entitled "The Journal of a Hungry Man," which is on deposit together with his other papers at the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley.</p><p>Chaffee founded a branch of the Communist Party in Santa Cruz in 1929. He shares his recollections of some of the socialists in Santa Cruz County, many of whom were of German heritage. He recalls organizing a hunger march up Pacific Avenue in Santa Cruz that went past the Santa Cruz County Court House, and also describes fascist reprisals against Santa Cruz socialists. During the 1930s, Chaffee forged friendships with radical luminaries such as the muckraking journalist and editor Lincoln Steffens and the writer Kenneth Rexroth. He also became an organizer for the Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union, which organized several successful strikes. Chaffee's oral history is a significant contribution to the historical record on this tumultuous chapter of California labor history.</p><p>. Apolonia Dangzalan: Filipina Businesswoman, Watsonville, California, 1896-1992.</p><p>This oral history provides rare primary documentation of the history of Filipino immigration in California from a female perspective. Dangzalan was born in February 1896 on the largest of the Philippine islands. In 1927, she joined her nephew in Watsonville and opened a boarding house for Filipino agricultural workers on Bridge Street, where she became known as "Mama" Dangzalan. She also opened another boarding house on Salinas Road in 1930. Dangzalan served as a labor contractor, hiring men to work in the Gary Company's fields and was one of very few women engaged in labor contracting. She also opened a liquor store, dance club, and pool hall on Main Street in Watsonville in 1936. During World War II, she owned a house of prostitution on Union Street in Watsonville. In 1950, Dangzalan went into business for herself as a farmer, primarily growing strawberries. She died in 1992, at the age of 96.</p><p> </p><p>. John Melendy: Santa Cruz County Farm Advisor, 1947-1976</p><p>Melendy served as a Santa Cruz County farm advisor with the Agricultural Extension Service for 30 years, including 10 as county director of the Agricultural Extension Service. He discusses changes in agriculture in Santa Cruz County from the 1940s through the 1970s--how rising land prices affected the types of crops grown, the effects of mechanization, farm size, pest control, and controversies over pesticide use that were only beginning to come to light at that time. A substantial portion of the interview is devoted to a detailed discussion of the rise and fall of the poultry industry in the Live Oak area.</p><p>In addition to providing a history of agriculture in Santa Cruz County, Melendy's narrative contributes to the institutional history of Agricultural Extension Service itself, particularly the position of farm advisor. While Melendy's oral history is useful for its detailed descriptions of the methods and practices of farming in the mid-20th century on the Central Coast of California, it also documents the tremendous changes that swept Santa Cruz County from 1946 to 1976 as it transitioned from a largely rural to the urban and suburban landscape that it is today.</p><p>. Mary Ann Berina Radovich: Croatian Apple Farmer, Watsonville, California</p><p>This oral history focuses on Radovich's extensive experience as an apple farmer in Watsonville from the 1930s to the 1970s. It is also a significant contribution to the ethnic history of the Croatian community in the Pajaro Valley of California. Radovich owned Berina Orchards from the 1940s through the time of this interview in 1977. Radovich discusses her family's history and emigration to the United States. She describes the early apple industry in Watsonville, and the changes that took place over the years in terms of labor, mechanization, irrigation, crop varieties, pest control, harvesting, and land use. Her detailed and reflective narration makes this oral history a singular contribution to the agricultural history of central California.</p><p>. Alvin Richardson: Family Farming: Watsonville, California, 1908-1977</p><p>Alvin C. Richardson was born on Beach Road in Watsonville in 1908. His grandfather had arrived in the Pajaro Valley in 1858, where he began the family farm on Beach Road. Richardson grew up in Watsonville and spent his entire life in the Pajaro Valley. At the time of this interview in 1977, he had lived at his farm on Buena Vista Drive since 1934. Except for a brief stint at Permanente in Moss Landing during World War II, Richardson completely devoted himself to farming and primarily raised bush berries. Richardson discusses in detail the varieties of berries grown throughout the years, the labor and capital requirements of farming, and the challenges of marketing and distribution.</p><p> </p><p>Photocopies of all 18 volumes can be ordered from the Regional History Project at (831) 459-2847 or via e-mail to ihreti@ucsc.edu.

The grant provides funding to maintain and enhance the Oracle Peregrines Outreach Program, which includes presentations to school and community groups on birds of prey and conservation of endangered species.</p><p>"The Oracle grant enables us to continue offering our presentations to school assemblies and other groups. Educating the public about protection of endangered species is an important part of our mission," said Glenn Stewart, program director with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG). </p><p>Stewart gives most of the group's outreach presentations, usually accompanied by his four-year-old tame peregrine falcon, Sophie. The education program has reached thousands of students throughout California.</p><p>To schedule presentations, schools and community groups can contact the SCPBRG at falconet@ucsc.edu, or use the online form available on the SCPBRG web site (<a href="http://www.scpbrg.org">www.scpbrg.org</a>). </p><p>"The school visits are a great way to increase students' appreciation for birds of prey and for nature in general, and to stimulate their interest in science and conservation biology," Stewart said.</p><p>The Oracle grant will also help the SCPBRG with efforts to recruit and train interns, coordinate volunteers, and maintain its web site.</p><p>The SCPBRG was founded at UCSC in 1975 to restore the endangered peregrine falcon population in California, which had been decimated by the pesticide DDT. At the time, only a few nesting pairs of peregrine falcons remained in California (two pairs had been found in a 1970 survey). By 1999, however, the SCPBRG was able to celebrate the removal of the peregrine falcon from the federal endangered species list, and the group received an award from the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in recognition of its "pioneering efforts." </p><p>The SCPBRG now applies its expertise to a wide range of bird species and is working toward creative solutions for a variety of wildlife management challenges in the western United States. </p><p>"Oracle is excited to continue our partnership with the SCPBRG," said Rosalie Gann, director of Oracle Giving and Oracle Volunteers. "Oracle is dedicated to helping preserve and protect endangered species like the peregrine falcon and is thrilled to aid in the recovery of the falcon population by supporting SCPBRG's efforts, including the monitoring of falcons at our campus."</p><p>SCPBRG biologists have been observing peregrine falcons at Oracle's campus in Redwood City since 1999. The company has supported the group's monitoring of falcons on the Oracle campus, as well as outreach efforts to share its work with the public. In spring of 2000, a pair of falcons began using a nest box installed by SCPBRG atop one of the Oracle buildings and nested there for three successive years. A camera in the nest box enabled visitors to the SCPBRG web site to watch the falcons raising their chicks.</p><p>Stewart's talks typically include a review of the work of UCSC conservation biologists that helped bring about the recovery of the peregrine falcon population; information about current nesting of peregrine falcons at the Oracle campus and other urban sites; and discussion of the SCPBRG's current work, including satellite tracking of migrating bald eagles and ecological restoration efforts on California's Channel Islands. </p><p>An article about Stewart and his school presentations can be found in UCSC's Currents Online newspaper at <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/10-11/stewart.asp">currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/10-11/stewart.asp</a>.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Stewart at (831) 459-2466 or gstewart@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e70e68072704601a012ff471f5331"><name>626</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz community collaborations receive nearly $1 million from Kellogg Foundation</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1106031600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz community...</display-name><path>/2005/01/626</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/01/626</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338091164</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338091164</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two of UC Santa Cruz's most highly regarded community collaborations have received nearly $1 million from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to support their work promoting educational achievement, economic equity, and environmental justice.	</p><p>UCSC's Bridging Multiple Worlds Alliance (BMWA) and the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC) will share a grant of $978,125 over three years. The Kellogg Foundation awarded the funds as part of its "engaged institutions" program. Since 1930, the nonprofit foundation has focused on "helping people help themselves," and its programs build the capacity of individuals, communities, and institutions to solve their own problems.  	</p><p>Since opening in 1965, UCSC has gone beyond its purely academic mission to distinguish itself as an engaged partner with local, regional, state, nationwide, and global communities.</p><p>	</p><p>"Our faculty are committed to building a better world, and these two programs strengthen the capacity of community-based organizations to change social policy and educational outcomes for the underrepresented and disadvantaged," said Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers. "Communities have a great deal to gain from interacting with the university, and the university also sees important gains from these collaborations. Our researchers are generating exceptionally useful work on issues of equity, diversity, and social justice."</p><p>Both BMWA and CJTC emphasize partnerships in which community members are active participants who help shape the research agenda, a commitment that the Kellogg Foundation also embraces.</p><p>BMWA was developed by UCSC psychology professor Catherine Cooper and is codirected by Cooper and Elizabeth Dominguez, director of the Cabrillo Advancement Program at Cabrillo College. The alliance is devoted to encouraging young people from diverse backgrounds to get on the path to higher education and college-based careers by increasing their awareness of college as an option for them and of the resources that are available to them. Active in six states, the alliance reaches out to children, beginning with sixth graders, and works with families, schools, and neighborhood programs to "bridge multiple worlds" and build university/community partnerships that open the academic pipeline to youth of all backgrounds, including those of African, Chinese, Filipino, Latino, European, Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Native American descent.</p><p>"Within the alliance, we create partnerships to help low-income, ethnic-minority, and immigrant youth create networks of support so they can build pathways to college and careers," said Cooper.</p><p>Under the leadership of Manuel Pastor and Dana Takagi, professors of Latin American and Latino studies and sociology, respectively, CJTC has built upon UCSC's reputation by building collaborative relationships between the center and community organizations working on issues of environmental degradation, regional empowerment, employment assistance programs, and local impacts of globalization, to name a few. </p><p>"The CJTC is dedicated to 'leveling the playing field' in public policy debates by giving community organizations the empirical data they need to seek social, economic, and environmental justice," said Pastor.</p><p>The Kellogg grant will support the ongoing work of BMWA and CJTC and will position each initiative as a model for university/community collaborations across the country. Programs will provide training to social justice leaders, educators, students, and policy makers to encourage collaboration with community-based organizations and the building of enduring alliances with other individuals.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914e72708072704601a012ff6f2e1916"><name>627</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sustainability leader to speak Jan. 27 at UCSC Earth Summit</title><author>Louise Donahue (831) 459-5312; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1106550000000</start-date><display-name>Sustainability leader to speak...</display-name><path>/2005/01/627</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/01/627</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338091575</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338091575</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Professor David Orr, the chair of environmental studies at Oberlin College and a leading figure in the campus sustainability movement, will be the keynote speaker at UC Santa Cruz's annual Campus Earth Summit on Thursday, January 27.</p><p>Sponsored by the Student Environmental Center, the summit will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., followed by an organic lunch, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.</p><p>The newly established Chancellor's Sustainability Council will be introduced at the summit, which will also include a brief opening address by Acting Chancellor Martin M.

The prize is awarded each year by the High Energy Astrophysics Division of the American Astronomical Society.</p><p>Woosley, an expert in theoretical astrophysics, is being recognized for his detailed modeling of supernovae--the massive explosions of dying stars. Woosley's work on the evolution of massive stars and their explosion as supernovae describes how the "heavy" elements needed for life, such as oxygen and iron, are forged and ejected. In addition, Woosley's "collapsar" model of massive star explosions has recently been identified as the central engine of some gamma-ray bursts, a major breakthrough in this field. </p><p>"There's something terribly attractive about a titanic explosion, as long as it occurs far enough away," Woosley said. "To think that the same explosions that make black holes and neutron stars are also creating the elements of life still continues to amaze me. I am honored to receive the Rossi Prize for what has been such rewarding work with so many bright students and colleagues."</p><p>The Rossi Prize is given in recognition of significant contributions as well as recent and original work in high-energy astrophysics. The prize is in honor of Bruno Rossi, an authority on cosmic-ray physics and a pioneer in the field of X-ray astronomy. The prize also includes an engraved certificate and a $1,500 award.</p><p>Woosley was recently awarded the American Physical Society's 2005 Hans Bethe Prize, which recognizes outstanding work in the area of astrophysics, nuclear physics, and related fields. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UCSC in 2003-04.

<p>That's the word from researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who surveyed consumers to find out what people want to know about their food and what factors would influence their purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>Food safety topped the list of consumer concerns, perhaps not surprisingly following headlines about mad cow disease and recurrent outbreaks of food contaminated with e. coli bacteria. Consumers also want to know more about the nutritional value of their food, the treatment of animals in food production, environmental impacts--including pesticides and genetic engineering--of food production, and the working conditions of people who labor in the food industry.</p>
<p>"Our goal was to give consumers a voice they might not have, and the first step was to find out what they want to know," said Phil Howard, a second-year postdoctoral researcher at UCSC's Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), who conducted the survey with postgraduate researcher Jan Perez. "Food retailers, processors, and growers should all start looking closely at these issues because people are interested in supporting them through their purchases. Broadly speaking, ethical consumerism is an emerging force, and people on the Central Coast appear eager to make more informed purchases."</p>
<p>Howard and Perez conducted five focus groups and mailed a 26-question survey to more than 1,000 randomly selected households in San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey Counties; the survey response rate was 48 percent. The survey was funded by a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant to foster sustainable agriculture on the Central Coast.</p>
<p>From Salinas to Silicon Valley, consumers voiced a strong interest in learning more about their food. Consumers expressed interest in knowing more about the wages food workers receive, the influence of large corporations, and how far food travels before it is sold.</p>
<p>More than 80 percent of survey respondents endorsed the idea of food labels as a source of the information they're seeking, said Howard.</p>
<p>"Product labels and brochures or retail displays were the most popular sources of information," said Howard, noting that newspapers, magazines, books, and the web were selected by about half of respondents. "People really want the information when they're making their purchasing decisions."</p>
<p>In some parts of Europe, Howard noted, meat is packaged with bar codes and stores are outfitted with computer terminals that allow consumers to scan the product and call up profiles of the farm where the food was produced. "Europeans are more committed to the idea of ethical consumption, and regional and local labels are a lot more prevalent there," said Howard. "The fair-trade movement began in Europe and is already changing the production practices of products like coffee and bananas."</p>
<p>Citing the growing popularity of seals or logos that signify food meets certain standards, such as the USDA's "organic" food label, survey respondents were asked to rank five potential "eco-labels," defined as follows:</p>
<p>o Humane--meat, dairy products, or eggs from animals that haven't been treated cruelly</p>
<p>o Locally grown--grown within 50 miles of point of purchase</p>
<p>o Living wage--provides above-poverty wages to workers involved in producing the food</p>
<p>o U. S. grown--grown in the United States</p>
<p>o Small-scale--supports small farms or businesses</p>
<p>Respondents were most enthusiastic about the idea of a "humane" label, with more than 30 percent citing it as their first choice, followed by locally grown (22 percent), living wage (16.5 percent), U.S. grown (5.9 percent), and small-scale (5.2 percent). "Humane treatment of animals was a very emotional topic in the focus groups--it came up in all of them," said Howard. In the survey, respondents were asked to choose only one standard from different combinations, but Howard noted that most people found that "very difficult"; many respondents said they would prefer one label that represented all of the standards.</p>
<p>"People are interested in buying food that is fresh and that they trust because they know where it came from," said Howard. "Consumers like the idea of supporting the local economy, and they want to support family farms, which have a strong emotional appeal to a lot of people."</p>
<p>In a separate question, consumers showed a strong willingness to pay a "price premium" for strawberries that would guarantee a living wage and safe working conditions for farmworkers. Eighty-four percent of respondents said they were willing to pay a 5 cent--or 3 percent--price premium on a $1.50 pint of strawberries for the assurance the standards were being met. The median price premium people were willing to pay was $1.06 per pint, or 71 percent above the regular price. Given that strawberry pickers typically earn 10.5 to 12.5 cents per pint, a 5-cent-per-pint price premium could fund a 40 percent increase in piece rate pay, said Howard.</p>
<p>"People being surveyed tend to express a greater willingness to pay than they actually support in the marketplace, but these results show the potential level of support for a price premium," said Howard.</p>

The benefit was only scheduled for two evenings, so Cuthbert promptly put together a quick design and moved on with his life. Shortly thereafter, he was hired as an assistant professor of theater arts at UC Santa Cruz.</p><p>Last April, the phone rang again and Cuthbert was asked to work on the same Crystal show at the same venue, but this time for a two-week run as a workshop production. Eight months later, Crystal's one-man show, now significantly enhanced and titled 700 Sundays, opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre to tremendous acclaim--with Cuthbert on board as lighting designer.</p><p>Crystal, who hosted the Academy Awards for the eighth time in 2004, has starred in a wide variety of films including When Harry Met Sally, Analyze This, City Slickers, Mr. Saturday Night, Throw Momma From the Train, The Princess Bride, and America's Sweethearts. But 700 Sundays, a two-act autobiographical play, was Crystal's Broadway debut. The title refers to the number of days he was able to spend with his hardworking father, who died when the comedian was just 15.</p><p>Cuthbert recalled the first time he saw the show, an unlikely mix of stand-up comedy and deeply personal stories about the death of Crystal's parents.</p><p>"I saw it with the set designer and we sat there in stunned silence," Cuthbert recalled. "We were both really moved. I remember saying that I understood why this guy is such a big star-he's earned it."</p><p>Once Cuthbert learned that the show was going to Broadway, he had approximately one month to come up with the new lighting design.</p><p>"My first impulse was not to do much with the lights; I didn't want to distract from the show," said Cuthbert. "But Billy actually wanted me to do a lot of things-he's an actor and director; he knows what he wants. So we worked a lot on moods and shifts in emotion."</p><p>" I was a little worried going in because all of the electricians are union and have a rich tradition of being difficult," Cuthbert added.  "But I ended up having a great group of people and things went really smoothly."</p><p>Cuthbert spent six weeks in New York preparing for the show, which opened on December 5, 2004. Three days later, the box office was at an $8.5 million advance, according to Playbill. The show is scheduled to run through March 6, and Cuthbert said there is talk of it traveling to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. It will also be turned into a book that is slated for publication in November by Warner Books. </p><p>"This is definitely the biggest show I've ever worked on," Cuthbert noted. "More people will see this show than all my other shows combined. It will also make more money than all of my other shows combined," he added.</p><p>Cuthbert's background includes a solid track record of work on the West Coast as a lighting designer for such venues as La Jolla Playhouse, the Old Globe, Sledgehammer Theatre, San Jose Rep, A Contemporary Theatre, the Intiman, the Magic Theatre, and Shakespeare Santa Cruz. His national tours include The History and Mystery of the Universe (about Buckminster Fuller) and two productions with the New Pickle Circus. He has also earned six awards for design excellence, including a San Diego Critics Circle Award. </p><p>Now in his second year on the UC Santa Cruz theater arts faculty, Cuthbert noted that continuing his professional career outside the university is essential for him as a professor, particularly to keep up-to-date with technology and trends in the theater. "I can't imagine trying to teach without actually doing lighting design," he observed. He added that working on a show like 700 Sundays also helps to expand his range.</p><p>"It's not the type of show that I'm normally hired to do," he explained. "I'm known for doing new and experimental plays. So in that sense, it was a bit of a challenge to create something realistic and subtle."</p><p>"But by far it was the most supported I've ever been as an artist," Cuthbert said. "Every whim I had, I could make happen. They would go to the ends of the earth to do whatever I needed to make sure the show worked."</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a2799e0f8072704601a012ffe0f05661"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/01/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/01/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626133482</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626157010</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a2799e0f8072704601a012ffe0f05661"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/01/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/01/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626133482</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626157010</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
