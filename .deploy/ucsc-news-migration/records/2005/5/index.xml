He recently returned from Tokyo where he presented his research at a conference of the International Association for the History of Religions.</p><p>"I've been looking at an unstudied element-the secretaries of state at the Vatican during the 19th and 20th centuries," Lease observed. "And the results have been very revealing. My conclusion: you're asking for trouble when you confuse religion and foreign policy."</p><p>"When you start making foreign policy based on religion, and particularly when it's fueled by religion based on absolute beliefs, you get some horrific results," said Lease. "The new pope is going to suffer from this problem," he added.</p><p>Lease cited examples such as the policy of the Vatican during World War II, noting the controversy over whether Pius XII and the Roman church did enough to help the Jews in Europe during Hitler's reign. "Religion tells you that you are primarily responsible for those who believe what you do," Lease explained. "For those who don't, it's often tough luck for them-they're left on the margins." He said that his many years of work on the relationship between religion and Germany's National Socialism also have led him to the same conclusions.</p><p>Lease also cited Vatican foreign policy in Palestine. "There you have Christian Arabs on one side and Jewish Israelis on the other," he said. "What you find is a diplomatic leaning on the side of your co-believers. And that is, in essence, a moral judgment."</p><p>"The same thing has happened with Iraq, which has been portrayed as a 'battle against evil and Saddam Hussein,'" Lease added. "History has shown, when you get into that kind of language and it becomes ingrained into your foreign policy decisions, the results are disastrous."</p><p>Lease studied in Germany at the University of Munich, eventually earning a doctorate degree in theology in 1968. His expertise covers a remarkable range of fields including early Christian archaeology, Vatican foreign policy and canon law, German intellectual history, German Judaism, and religious/cultural evolution. In 2001, Lease returned to the University of Munich as a guest professor, occupying the renowned Romano Guardini Chair for Theory of Culture and Religion. </p><p>"I met Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) when I was a student at Munich," Lease noted. "Based on his remarks of the last 20 years and the last two months, it appears he will continue to mix religion with foreign policy, which will in turn lead to troubling results."</p><p>Lease joined the faculty at UCSC in 1973 and was chair of the History of Consciousness Department from 1998 to 2004. He has also chaired the UCSC Religious Studies Department, served as director of the Education Abroad Program in Goettingen, West Germany, and was dean of the UCSC Humanities Division from 1990 to 1995. </p><p>Lease served as the executive secretary of the North American Association for the Study of Religion from 1995 to 2005 and was recently reelected treasurer of the International Association for the History of Religions-the presenter of the Tokyo conference that was attended by more than 1,700 scholars from around the world.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ec49f8072704601a012ffd2174d47"><name>679</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>African Americans making their mark in music and the arts but equality remains elusive, sociologist reports</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1115190000000</start-date><display-name>African Americans making their...</display-name><path>/2005/05/679</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/679</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338112565</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338112565</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Over the past decade, African Americans have become more visible on the cultural landscape of the United States: Jazz trumpet virtuoso Wynton Marsalis is the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center; African Americans are widely seen on network television; and African Americans represent the nation at the highest levels of power.</p><p>In the new book Cultural Moves: African Americans and the Politics of Representation (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2005), author Herman Gray explores the impact of such inroads on U.S. culture, examining these achievements in relation to persistent gaps in the struggle for greater social justice and equality.</p><p>"I want my multiracial 6-year-old grandson to be able to turn on the television and see other people of color, but we can't stop there," said Gray, a professor of sociology and chair of the department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "Just because television does a better job now of representing our diversity doesn't mean we've achieved our goals of justice and equality."</p><p>Among the "cultural moves" Gray explores in the book are:</p><p>. How Wynton Marsalis and his creation of a jazz canon at Lincoln Center increased 	the cultural visibility and legitimacy of jazz.</p><p>. How shifting ground undermines the struggle for racial equality: years of activism 	increased the representation of African Americans on network television, only to have 	conservatives use the milestone to claim that racism and inequality are problems of 	the past.</p><p>. How black musicians Steve Coleman, George Lewis, and Pamela Z use new 	technology to shape and extend black musical traditions and cultural identities.</p><p>In Cultural Moves, Gray examines the impact of culture on political change and explores how black popular culture has shaped the nation's cultural imagination.</p><p>"We've witnessed cultural moves used by African Americans to consolidate a sense of power, of belonging and representation. Wynton Marsalis embodies African American accomplishment in jazz," said Gray. "But Marsalis also has a powerful sense of himself as an African American person. His visibility has helped place African Americans at the center of national identity." </p><p>At the same time, notes Gray, other jazz musicians remain invisible, including those in the "jazz left," such as saxophonist Steve Coleman, who brings what Gray called a "diasporic approach" to his music, blending hip-hop and be-bop, and traveling to Africa and Cuba to incorporate those musical influences. "The price to pay for arrival is what's left out. For every cultural move, there's a countermove," Gray added wryly. "Marsalis is at the center of publicity and promotion. Coleman, too, wants to get African American music ensconced in the American national imagination, but he went a different route. He travels, and he goes to community centers, where he teaches and creates community connections." </p><p>Gray also trains his critical eye on information technology, going beyond issues of competence and access to document how African American creative artists are using technology in their work and to explore the "racial logic" inherent in new information technologies. </p><p>Lewis, a trombonist who also composes on computers, found that some of the programming software he used in composing was unable to mimic in real time some fundamental elements of the African American musical form, including syncopation, collective improvisation, and call-and-response. "The programs are incapable of emulating some of the rhythmic and spatial requirements that define African American music," said Gray. "Lewis's work reveals how the logic of computer programming is already structured in a 'racial logic,' in turn challenging the idea that new information technologies are neutral."</p><p>Gray points out the limits of a civil-rights strategy based on inclusion and representation. "In a global logic that celebrates rather than represses differences of all kinds, what does it mean to petition for greater visibility when the racial landscape has shifted?" asks Gray. "Network television is like Lincoln Center: It is useful as an aspiration--to a point. More doesn't guarantee you justice, it just guarantees you more. It is not necessarily a gain to have African Americans as secretary of state or national security adviser if they're still dropping bombs on people."</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Herman Gray may be reached at (831) 459-3715 or via e-mail at herman@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ec6538072704601a012ff270394be"><name>680</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Regional History Project announces publication of 'behind-the scenes' look at library's Special Collections</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1115276400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Regional History Project...</display-name><path>/2005/05/680</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/680</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338113029</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338113029</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Regional History Project at the University Library announces the publication of Rita Bottoms, Polyartist Librarian, UC Santa Cruz: 1965-2003. Project director Irene Reti conducted 14 hours of interviews with Rita Bottoms, former head of Special Collections at UCSC, shortly before Bottoms' retirement in March 2003. This oral history provides a vivid and intimate look at 37 years "behind the scenes" in the library's Special Collections.</p><p>For nearly four decades, Bottoms immersed herself in collecting work by some of the most eminent writers and photographers of the 20th century, including the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein, photographer Edward Weston, composer John Cage, visual poet Kenneth Patchen, poet and letterpress book printer William Everson, poet and visual artist Lawrence Ferlinghetti, composer and poet Lou Harrison, singer and photographer Graham Nash, and philosopher Norman O. Brown. </p><p>But Bottoms' role as a curator and librarian extended far beyond acquiring collections; she developed intense and profound intellectual and emotional relationships with each of these individuals. It is her detailed and deeply personal stories of these relationships that form the heart of this volume and provide the kind of human amplification of the library's collections that can only be captured through oral history. Bottoms' recollections of these individuals are an important contribution to the history of 20th-century art and literature in the United States.</p><p>Photocopies of the volume can be ordered from the Regional History Project at (831) 459-2847 or via e-mail to ihreti@ucsc.edu. The volume is also available for viewing at Special Collections, McHenry Library, and at Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley, or can be checked out from the McHenry Library. In addition, the complete text of the oral history can be viewed at the Regional History web site: <a href="http://library/reg-hist/">http://library/reg-hist/</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ec7e28072704601a012ff56a5b628"><name>681</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Music and stargazing entice summer visitors to Mt.

Hamilton. </p><p>Music of the Spheres is a benefit summer concert series whose proceeds support the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), a multicampus research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz that serves over 100 UC astronomers. Each of the six Music of the Spheres evenings combines a performance by world-acclaimed musicians and a lecture by a renowned astronomy researcher. Afterward, audience members take turns at the historic Lick Telescope, a 36-inch refractor that has been in operation since 1888 and remains the second largest refracting telescope ever built. A cadre of well-trained volunteers assist in these events by sharing their own telescopes and expertise with interested members of the audience. </p><p>Music of the Spheres concerts will take place on June 24 and 25, July 29 and 30, and August 26 and 27. For details on each concert, visit the following Lick Observatory web site: <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/music.html">www.ucolick.org/public/music.html</a>.</p><p>Tickets for each Music of the Spheres evening are offered at three levels: standard ($40), preferred ($100), and VIP ($150). All tickets include the concert, astronomy talk, viewing session through the 36-inch telescope, and a commemorative wineglass or coffee cup. Preferred ticket holders have the additional benefits of reserved seating and a 20 percent discount at the gift shop. A VIP ticket further entitles visitors to a private tour of the 120-inch Shane reflecting telescope and a light buffet.</p><p>Tickets for Music of the Spheres can be purchased from the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159. Preferred and VIP tickets will be available starting May 17 and standard tickets starting May 20. For additional information, visit the <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/tickets">Ticket Office</a> web site.</p><p>Another popular program offered by Lick Observatory is the Summer Visitors Program, which gives the public access to both the 36-inch Lick Telescope and the 40-inch Anna Nickel Reflector, a telescope scientists currently use to spot planets outside the solar system. As with the Music of the Spheres events, amateur astronomer volunteers provide additional outside viewing and informal talks. Each program also features two speakers to ensure an interesting evening even if bad weather prevents stargazing. The lectures include a history of Lick Observatory and multimedia presentations by Lick astronomers. </p><p>Dates for the Summer Visitors Program are July 15 and 16 at 8:30 p.m., August 12 and 13 at 8 p.m., and September 9 and 10 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $5 and will be made available through a lottery system, with a limit of four tickets per request. Ticket requests can be made from May 16 through May 29 using an online form (which will be available for those two weeks at http://www.ucolick.org/public/svp) or by mail (SVP, PO Box 85, Mount Hamilton, CA 95140). Additional information about the program, as well as directions and maps, are available online at: <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/sumvispro.html">www.ucolick.org/public/sumvispro.html</a>.</p><p>An added attraction this year is an exhibit of paintings by acclaimed artist Chesley Bonestell. The Bonestell exhibit, held in Lick Observatory's Main Building, commemorates the hundredth anniversary of the event that spurred Bonestell's interest in space art. Bonestell attended the Summer Visitors Program in 1905 and was most impressed with a view of Saturn through the Clark 12-inch refractor, which occupied the dome that now houses the Nickel 40-inch reflector. He painted a picture of Saturn as soon as he got home, and went on to produce a wide variety of astronomical paintings that have in turn inspired many astronomers' careers. Bonestell's works will remain on display at Lick Observatory through spring 2006.</p><p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Mt. Hamilton Road (Route 130). Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory remains among the most productive research observatories in the world.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ec9228072704601a012ff07678152"><name>682</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC College Prep Online expands to operate online charter schools</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1115622000000</start-date><display-name>UC College Prep Online...</display-name><path>/2005/05/682</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/682</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338113783</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338113783</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Building on the success of its online college-prep programs, the University of California is gearing up to establish a UC Online Academy with three online charter schools slated to open in the fall of 2006.</p><p>UC College Prep Online (UCCP), based at UC Santa Cruz, recently received a three-year $550,000 grant from the California Department of Education's Public Charter Schools Grant Program to develop online schools in Imperial, Mendocino, and Butte Counties. </p><p>The academy will provide access for independent learners and special needs students to a high-quality college preparation curriculum. Potential beneficiaries might include students in foster care or migrant families that move around, teen mothers, students in the court system, students engaged in competitive athletics or performing arts, and those who are hospitalized.</p><p>"The UC Online Academy is designed to meet the needs of students who are best-served by the flexibility of an online program. We know there are UC-potential kids out there whose needs are not being met," said Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs at UCSC.</p><p>The university will work with each County Office of Education to develop programs and share responsibilities. Educational programs will follow a standards-based online curriculum aligned to the state framework for high schools and the admission requirements of the University of California. Most activities will be conducted online, augmented by in-person physical education, academic research, and community service opportunities. The operation of charter schools establishes UCCP as a credit-granting entity that satisfies federal mandates of the "No Child Left Behind Act."</p><p>"UCCP will continue to offer supplemental services and online college-prep courses to schools with high enrollments of low-income and minority students. We have recently developed a new online algebra course that will serve the needs of many California students," said Hernandez.</p><p>Founded in 1999, UC College Prep Online (UCCP) was created in response to a state mandate to provide equity in access to rigorous curriculum. Historically, UCCP has offered courses that fill in the gaps where academic resources do not exist.</p><p>The UC Online Academy grant was approved by the State Board of Education with funding from the federal Public Charter Schools Grant Program. A $31.5 million package approved by state schools chief Jack O'Connell will help open 84 new charter schools in California, and help 11 existing high-quality charter schools share their best practices with other K-12 public schools. UC received $180,000 in start-up funds for each online charter school. California currently has more than 500 charter schools. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914eca558072704601a012ffeb7e49c8"><name>683</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lacking a decent meal, killer whales reach for the popcorn</title><author>Françoise Chanut (831) 459-2495, fchanut@ucsc.edu; Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495, stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1115190000000</start-date><display-name>Lacking a decent meal,...</display-name><path>/2005/05/683</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/683</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338114084</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338114084</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A study comparing the nutritional demands of killer whales with the caloric content of their prey has startling implications for the potential impact of these large predators on populations of other marine mammals. The study also raises issues relevant to the establishment of marine reserves and efforts to reintroduce large predators into terrestrial ecosystems, said Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><p>Williams and her coauthors at UCSC and the University of Alaska published their findings in the December issue of the journal Ecology. Their analysis suggests that as few as 40 killer whales preying on Steller sea lions along the coast of the Aleutian Islands could have caused the fivefold decline that has been recorded in that population since the early 1980s. Similarly, the more recent tenfold drop in sea otter numbers in the same area could be the feat of just one pod of four or five killer whales specializing in sea otter hunting.</p><p>"Our main finding is the magnitude of the appetite of the killer whales," Williams said. "Predators with such a large body size and high metabolic rate have high nutritional demands."</p><p>This study bolsters a hypothesis put forth by the authors in earlier papers that linked declining marine mammal populations in the Pacific Northeast to the decimation of the great whales by industrial whaling.</p><p>The story begins more than a decade ago when Williams's coauthor James Estes, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, was trying to understand the rapid disappearance of sea otters in parts of the Aleutian Islands, a 1,200-mile archipelago west of the Alaska Peninsula. The first eyewitness reports of killer whale attacks on sea otters came in the 1990s, a time when the Aleutian sea otter population was declining by 25 percent each year. But in protected bays that were inaccessible to killer whales, Estes found the sea otter populations to be stable. He concluded that killer whale predation was driving the disappearance of the sea otters.</p><p>At the same time, researchers had been puzzling over the precipitous decline of Steller sea lions and harbor seals in the same region. They had first blamed overfishing by commercial fisheries, which would deprive seals and sea lions of their staple food. But they couldn't find evidence that the animals were dying of starvation, nor for that matter of any illness.</p><p>"After having seen what killer whales did to sea otters, it wasn't hard to imagine that they could do the same thing to seals and sea lions," Estes said.</p><p>Looking at records of marine mammal counts dating back to the 1950s, coauthor Alan Springer of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks observed successive waves of population collapses. The sea otters' nosedive that began in the early 1990s came after similar trends had affected Steller sea lions in the late 1980s and harbor seals in the late 1970s. Before these declines, the 1960s had seen the decimation of the North Pacific great whales by commercial whaling.</p><p>The team proposed that killer whales had once fed primarily on great whales, until those large prey became too scarce to provide a steady food supply. The killer whales then redirected their hunting to progressively smaller animals.</p><p>But did the numbers add up? That is the question the researchers set out to answer in their latest paper.</p><p>It is difficult to evaluate the nutritional requirements of large predators, Williams said. Scientists know how much killer whales eat in captivity, but not when they are swimming and hunting in the open ocean. Direct measurements of killer whale diets in the wild were not feasible, but Williams and others have done extensive research on the physiology and nutritional needs of smaller marine mammals, such as dolphins and seals. Williams extrapolated from this work to estimate the caloric intake of the much larger killer whales. She calculated that an adult female, weighing approximately two tons, would need more than 190,000 kilocalories per day; a 4.5-ton male would need 290,000 kilocalories per day.</p><p>Adult sea otters weigh between 50 and 75 pounds, which represents, on average, 50,000 kilocalories. Depending on its size and the size of its prey, an adult killer whale could satisfy its appetite by gobbling up between 3 and 7 sea otters a day--or 1,095 to 2,555 otters per year. Williams estimated that the decline of sea otter numbers in the 1990s in the Aleutian Islands corresponded to the loss of approximately 10,000 adults per year. An average pod of killer whales (one adult male and four to five adult females) with a single-minded appetite could easily eliminate that many otters.</p><p>Biologists recognize at least two different types of killer whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. They differ in behavior, social structure, genetics, and diet. Most killer whales eat fish, but a small proportion--perhaps 10 to 17 percent--feeds primarily on marine mammals. A conservative estimate places the number of marine mammal-eating killer whales at around 170 in the Aleutian Islands waters, according to Williams and her colleagues. While no killer whale may care for a diet consisting exclusively of sea otters, each one of those 170 orcas would only have to eat one or two sea otters a week to cause the observed decline.</p><p>Compared to the lean sea otters, blubber-padded seals and sea lions have a high caloric content, so fewer are needed to feed a killer whale. Williams estimated that an average adult killer whale would be satiated on two to three Steller sea lion pups every day or one adult every two to three days. A predator population of 170 killer whales bent on a sea lion diet would remove 40,000 individuals from circulation each year, three times the number needed to drive the yearly rate of Steller sea lion decline observed since the 1980s.</p><p>By comparison, one great whale represents an enormous supply of calories. "You could feed 17 killer whales for a day on a single grey whale carcass," Williams said.</p><p>Williams noted that she probably underestimated the potential impact of killer whales, because she didn't factor in the greater caloric requirements of pregnant females and growing juveniles. Her calculations do not prove that killer whales are responsible for the disappearance of smaller marine mammals, but they show that it is a definite possibility.</p><p>"It's really a feasibility study," Estes said.</p><p>Over years of field observations in the Aleutian archipelago, Estes has found no evidence that sea lions or otters were starving, a common hypothesis to explain large population drops. On the other hand, there is a lot of historical and current evidence that killer whales attack and feed on large whales, he said. After the great whales declined, it would make sense for killer whales to turn to other kinds of prey.</p><p>In the Monterey Bay, reports of killer whale attacks on grey whales are common during the spring migration. The killer whales prey on juvenile grey whales as they migrate with their mothers from calving grounds in Baja California to feeding grounds in Alaska.</p><p>"What is remarkable is how quickly we could lose the sea otter population in the Monterey Bay if killer whales decided to change from hunting grey whale calves to feeding on otters. Theoretically, the otters would be gone in two months," Williams said.</p><p> </p><p>Switches in predatory behaviors are well documented among land animals, Williams said. Lions, for instance, may prefer wildebeests, but they will hunt small antelopes in the absence of larger prey, she said.</p><p>"Many carnivores chose prey that make energetic sense," she said. "Rather than starve when preferred foods are gone, they may turn to the prey equivalent of rice cakes and popcorn."</p><p>Killer whales are resourceful, Estes said. Different groups of marine mammal-eating killer whales have different diets and hunting strategies, he said. Some specialize in seals, others in porpoises. </p><p>"A few animals learning to do something clever could have a lot of local impact," Estes said. "The implication for nature conservation is that whale populations should be allowed to recover. Grey whales may have completely recovered, but they are a very small part of the whole whale community."</p><p>The methods Williams and her colleagues used--demographic analyses and measurements of caloric value--have been around since the 1940s, she said. What's new is putting together physiology and demographics.</p><p>"It is amazing that we haven't made more use of these simple analyses," she said.</p><p>Knowing the nutritional requirements of killer whales has important implications for the design of marine reserves. Williams drew a parallel with the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone. "We would like to re-create a natural ecosystem, but we need to do it with a realistic idea of what predators are going to need to survive," she said.</p><p>She is currently applying her approach to estimate the ecological impact of terrestrial predators, such as coyotes and mountain lions, on local ecosystems.</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Williams at (831) 459-5123 or williams@biology.ucsc.edu and Estes at (831) 459-2820 or jestes@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ece048072704601a012ff3b37eb31"><name>686</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomical Society of the Pacific awards highest honor to UC Santa Cruz astronomer Robert Kraft</title><author>Francois Chanut (831) 459-2495; fchanut@ucsc.edu / Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1116226800000</start-date><display-name>Astronomical Society of the...</display-name><path>/2005/05/686</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/686</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338114992</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338114992</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has awarded the 2005 Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal to Robert P. Kraft, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and former director of the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick). Kraft is the sixth astronomer associated with the Lick Observatory to receive this award, and the fourth associated with UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The Bruce Medal is the highest honor bestowed by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP). It recognizes scientists worldwide for fundamental and lifelong contributions to the field of astronomy. Previous recipients include many renowned astronomers, such as 1938 medalist Edwin P. Hubble, who showed the universe is expanding, and 2003 medalist Vera Rubin, who demonstrated the existence of dark matter.</p>
<p>Kraft has received many awards in his long and distinguished career, but he said the Bruce Medal holds special significance. "The Bruce Medal I cherish the most since it has the longest history and is given on a worldwide basis," Kraft said. "The list of recipients contains a lot of my heroes, such as Otto Struve and Jesse Greenstein, and I feel really honored to be on that list."</p>
<p>In announcing the award, the ASP acknowledged Kraft's outstanding research achievements and extensive service to the astronomy community.</p>
<p>Kraft served as director of UCO/Lick from 1981 to 1991. During this time he played a key role in bringing about the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, by committing the resources of Lick Observatory to the construction and instrumentation of the world's first 10-meter telescope, now known as Keck I. Keck I and its twin, Keck II, remain the largest optical and infrared telescopes ever built. UCO/Lick operates the Keck Obervatory in cooperation with Caltech and NASA.</p>
<p>Kraft also served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1974 to 1976 and president of the International Astronomical Union from 1997 to 2000.</p>
<p>As a researcher, Kraft made important contributions to the understanding of novae, stars that undergo a sudden increase in brightness due to massive nuclear explosions. He showed that all novae arise from close binary star systems in which the more evolved star (usually a white dwarf) siphons up hydrogen and helium from its expanding companion. The transferred material forms a disk whose rapid accretion onto the dense white dwarf leads to an explosion. Kraft also established an important rung on the ladder of celestial distances by assessing the contribution of interstellar dust to the dimming of Cepheid variables in the disk of our galaxy. His work on stellar rotation--now a fundamental topic in astronomy textbooks--showed that stars like the Sun spin slower and slower as they age because winds of charged particles carry away their angular momentum.</p>
<p>Kraft became interested in the chemical composition of stars after observing an unusual star named FG Sagittae, which underwent rapid changes in composition and later nearly disappeared behind a cloud of its own soot. He went on to analyze in detail the chemical composition of the oldest stars in our galaxy. This work led to several major contributions, including evidence for deep mixing of elements in red giants, bloated stars at a late stage of their evolution. He also established intriguing differences between the chemical composition of stars in globular clusters and their neighboring field stars.</p>
<p>Kraft, 77, earned his B.S. and M.S. in mathematics from the University of Washington and his Ph.D. in astronomy from UC Berkeley. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as an astronomer at the Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories in Pasadena. He joined UC Santa Cruz in 1967 as an astronomer at Lick Observatory and professor of astronomy and astrophysics, after holding assistant professor positions at Indiana University and the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Soon after joining UC Santa Cruz, Kraft was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1995, the American Astronomical Society named Kraft the Henry Norris Russell Lecturer for his lifetime achievement in astronomy. Kraft's work currently focuses on the abundance of rare earth elements in globular clusters.</p>
<p>The Astronomical Society of the Pacific was founded in San Francisco in 1889 and has awarded the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal most years since 1898. From the outset, the medal was meant for astronomers of any nationality and either gender, and might only be awarded when a suitable candidate was found. The ASP board of directors selects a medalist among candidates nominated each year by the directors of six observatories--three in the United States and three elsewhere in the world.

On Tuesday, May 17, campus officials and distinguished visitors are dedicating new facilities for the laboratory and celebrating its achievements. </p><p>"The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics is a technological powerhouse for observational astronomy, harnessing complex technologies from a variety of disciplines to enable us to see the cosmos with greater precision and clarity," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton.</p><p>Established in 2002 with a $9.1 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics (LAO) develops innovative instrumentation to apply adaptive optics technology in astronomy. Adaptive optics sharpens the vision of ground-based telescopes by removing the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. </p><p>"Adaptive optics is one of the most exciting developments in ground-based astronomy in the last decade. It is crucial to very important science being planned for existing large telescopes and absolutely essential to the next generation of giant telescopes," said Joseph Miller, director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), which oversees the LAO.</p><p>UCO/Lick already operates world-class technical facilities for astronomical instrumentation at UCSC, including an optical lab and shops, an engineering lab, and an advanced detector lab. </p><p>"Now we have added a major laboratory for advancing the technology of adaptive optics--the only such lab associated with a university in the United States. It gives us the ability to develop and test new experimental techniques and equipment here on campus. This is a dream come true for me," Miller said.</p><p>The LAO began operations in temporary facilities at the Lick optical lab before moving to its current location on the ground floor of Thimann Laboratories. Renovation of the facilities in Thimann was just completed last week.</p><p>The lab occupies two rooms with controlled temperature and lighting conditions and a clean environment to protect sensitive equipment from contamination. The instrument tables where researchers conduct experiments float on a cushion of air to isolate them from vibrations. The facilities also include a Class 100 clean room where optical instruments can be built.</p><p>"The lab has all the precision optical measurement tools we need to test advanced adaptive optics systems," said LAO principal investigator Claire Max, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. </p><p>"The techniques we are exploring are well beyond the current state of the art, so we need to be able to put these systems through their paces in the lab before we try to take them to a telescope," she said.</p><p>Max is also the director of the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO), headquartered at UCSC and established in 1999 by the National Science Foundation. The CfAO focuses on the advancement of adaptive optics technology in both astronomy and vision science. The LAO complements CfAO, providing a testing ground for concepts developed by CfAO researchers, Max said. </p><p>The lab also provides an opportunity for UCSC students, both undergraduates and graduate students, to get involved in practical astronomy and the development of astronomical instruments, said LAO director Don Gavel. </p><p>"It is an interdisciplinary effort, so it brings together faculty and students from different programs on campus," Gavel said.</p><p>Much of the work in the LAO focuses on two major goals, known as extreme adaptive optics and multiconjugate adaptive optics. Extreme AO pushes the limits of adaptive optics in an effort to give astronomers the ability to see the dim light from a planet orbiting a bright star. Astronomers have discovered more than 100 planets outside our solar system (called extrasolar planets) by indirect methods that detect the gravitational tug of the planet on its parent star. To actually see an extrasolar planet, however, requires an adaptive optics system that can prevent scattered light from the parent star from obscuring the nearby planet.</p><p>Only one extrasolar planet has been photographed, and that planet orbits a brown dwarf, a "failed star" not nearly as bright as ordinary stars such as the Sun. Extreme AO aims to get images so sharp that a planet can be seen next to a star more than a billion times brighter than the planet. Astronomers could then analyze the light from the planet for clues to its composition and other properties.</p><p>An adaptive optics system precisely measures how light gets distorted as it passes through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. The system then calculates the corrections needed to counteract that distortion, applies the corrections by bouncing the light gathered by the telescope off a deformable mirror, and repeats the whole process hundreds of times per second. The deformable mirror is a key component, constantly changing shape to counteract the blurring effects of the atmosphere.</p><p>The LAO is at the forefront of the development of deformable mirrors based on MEMS technology. MEMS, which stands for micro-electro-mechanical systems, is a revolutionary technology that uses silicon-based fabrication techniques (like those used to make computer chips) and micromachining to make integrated devices that combine sophisticated electronics with moving parts. The LAO has been testing a MEMS mirror with 1,000 actuators, tiny elements that move up and down to change the shape of the mirror, which is about the size of a postage stamp. </p><p>"For extreme AO, we need a deformable mirror that is very optically smooth. We've got a beautiful setup for testing these mirrors and they are getting better and better. We will soon begin testing one with 4,000 actuators on the mirror, which is what we think we need to build an extreme AO system," Max said. </p><p>Multiconjugate AO aims to increase the field of view, or the size of the area that is corrected by the AO system. Current AO systems use a single point-source of light--either a bright star or an "artificial guide star" created by a laser--as a reference for measuring atmospheric blurring. The system can only apply corrections for a relatively small region around that reference point. But the field of view could be increased by using multiple laser guide stars, Gavel said.</p><p>"With multiple guide stars, you can effectively do tomography of the atmosphere, similar to medical imaging techniques like CT scans, to extend adaptive optics over a wide field of view," he said. </p><p>Future giant telescopes now in the planning stages will require this type of adaptive optics. But the complexity of the system increases considerably with the need to integrate measurements from multiple guide stars and coordinate multiple deformable mirrors.</p><p>"There are different methods for doing this, and we will be testing them to see which does better," Max said.</p><p>With its support for the LAO, the Moore Foundation has provided vital resources for researchers to advance the state of the art of adaptive optics, said Miller. </p><p>"This grant allows us to fully equip the lab and get it off to a great start, giving us time to make it self-sustaining," he said.</p><p>In addition to funding the LAO, the Moore Foundation has provided $35 million in grants for the design phase of a giant telescope project: the Thirty Meter Telescope, a joint undertaking of UCO/Lick, the California Institute of Technology, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy.</p><p>Established in September 2000, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation seeks to develop outcome-based projects that will improve the quality of life for future generations. The foundation has organized the majority of its grantmaking around large-scale initiatives in three areas of interest to the Moores: environmental conservation, science, and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>________</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Max at (831) 459-2049 or <a href="mailto:max@ucolick.org">max@ucolick.org</a> and Miller at (831) 459-2991 or <a href="mailto:miller@ucolick.org">miller@ucolick.org</a>.</p><p>Images can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/">http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/</a></p><p>This release is available electronically at the following web site: <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu">http://press.ucsc.edu</a></p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ed19f8072704601a012fff4815780"><name>690</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Twelve community college students receive $20,000 scholarships to UC Santa Cruz</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1116399600000</start-date><display-name>Twelve community college students...</display-name><path>/2005/05/690</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/690</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338115950</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338115950</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Administration</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a joyful rite of spring, the University of California, Santa Cruz, has selected 12 regional community college students who will receive $20,000 scholarships to enroll at the university this fall.</p>
<p>This year's recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards include</p>
<p>single parents, immigrants from Mexico and Vietnam, and re-entry students.</p>
<p>The awards recognize talented students who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, have a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding summer work experience in a field that complements their studies.</p>
<p>"This scholarship program opens doors to some of the most academically talented and determined students who enroll at UCSC each year, and I am proud to welcome them to our campus," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "Their contributions enrich our student community, and their achievements inspire us all."</p>
<p>The presidents of 13 regional community colleges each nominate several students, and recipients are selected by Denton in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Screening Committee. The program was established in 1993 by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to foster the transfer of accomplished community college students to UCSC.</p>

A collection of essays, talks, notes, and interviews covering a time frame from 1990 to 2000, the diverse, yet interrelated pieces underscore Mackey's versatile work as a writer and critic. </p><p>The 18 selections in the book run the gamut from critical essays on poet Walt Whitman's interest in phrenology and Robert Duncan's Vietnam era war poems, to written adaptations of talks Mackey gave about Miles Davis's trumpet sound and the influence of Spanish poet Federico García Lorca on American poetry, focusing on Lorca's concept of "duende," a prized element in flamenco singing. </p><p>The collection also includes six interviews with Mackey that appeared in such publications as the Chicago Review and Poetry Flash, as well as a piece about editing the literary journal, Hambone. </p><p>"It's a book that reflects the fact that I function not only as a literary critic, but also as a poet, fiction writer, and editor of a literary magazine," Mackey noted. "Paracritical Hinge seemed like a good title for the book because it reflects a figurative hinge on a door that permits a flow between criticism and fiction, art and commentary-the practices I engage in," he added. </p><p>The book includes an essay Mackey wrote about a CD of poetry titled Strick that he recorded along with two jazz musicians in 1994 for the Spoken Engine record label in Memphis. "I was asked by the editor of an anthology of essays to write something about poetry performance," Mackey said. "It talks about some of my attitudes toward performance and the process of collaboration." </p><p>Mackey is the author of five chapbooks of poetry, one previous book of literary criticism, and three books of poetry. He has also completed three novels in a series titled From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate--composed as letters written by a composer/multi-instrumentalist named N, a founding member of a band known as the Mystic Horn Society. </p><p>Mackey's 1985 poetry book, Eroding Witness, was selected for publication in the National Poetry Series. He received a Whiting Writer's Award in 1993 and was elected to the Board of Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets in 2001.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ed4748072704601a012fff7d25092"><name>692</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: Dedication of the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics at UCSC on May 17</title><author>Tim Stephens (831) 459-2495; stephens@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1115794800000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: Dedication of...</display-name><path>/2005/05/692</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/692</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338116676</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338116676</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2495</phone><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A dedication and celebration of the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics, a new facility for developing innovative instrumentation for adaptive optics applications in astronomy, will take place on Tuesday, May 17, from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m.</p><p>Where: Thimann Courtyard, UC Santa Cruz</p><p>Who: Speakers at the dedication will include the following:</p><p>	Denice D.

The sudden rupture of a huge fault beneath the Indian Ocean unleashed a devastating tsunami. It was the largest earthquake in the past 40 years and was followed by the second largest just three months later (March 28, 2005) on an adjacent fault. </p><p>Modern monitoring technology gathered an unprecedented amount of seismological data on these extraordinary events. Three papers published this week in the May 20 issue of the journal Science by an international group of seismologists provide a comprehensive scientific analysis of the earthquakes. The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), a university research consortium, played a central role in bringing about this coordinated report from three teams of experts. IRIS, funded by the National Science Foundation, operates a global network of seismic monitoring stations that provided much of the data for the analysis. </p><p>"We wanted to give as unified and comprehensive a report as possible, rather than having bits and pieces of it come out in separate papers," said Thorne Lay, professor of Earth sciences and director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and chair of the board of directors of IRIS. </p><p>Lay organized the overall effort and solicited contributions for the three papers from leading seismological researchers at U.S. and international research programs. David Simpson, president of IRIS, helped Lay arrange for the papers to be published together in a special section of Science.</p><p>"This is really a watershed event," Lay said. "We've never had such comprehensive data for a great earthquake, because we didn't have the instrumentation to gather it 40 years ago. And then the sheer size of the event is so awesome. It is nature at its most formidable, and it has been humbling to all of us who have studied it. The willingness of the seismological research community to work together to give a comprehensive report on the earthquake reflects our understanding of the importance of this event."</p><p>Lay is lead author of the first Science paper, which provides an overview of the two earthquakes, and he is a coauthor on the second paper, which focuses on the processes involved in the rupture of the fault. The third paper describes how the earthquakes caused the whole planet to vibrate with "free oscillations," like the ringing of a bell. A complete list of the authors of each paper can be found at the end of this press release.</p><p>The two earthquakes are the largest that have happened since the global deployment of highly sensitive digital broadband seismometers. These instruments, deployed around the world by IRIS and other organizations, recorded both the huge ground motions from the mainshocks and the tiny motions from small aftershocks and free oscillations of the planet.</p><p>Record-setting features of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 26, 2005, include the longest fault rupture ever observed (1,200 to 1,300 kilometers, or 720 to 780 miles) and the longest duration of faulting (at least 10 minutes). The aftershocks included the most energetic earthquake swarm ever observed.</p><p>The ground motions during the prolonged, intense shaking of the mainshock were greater than in any earthquake previously recorded by global broadband seismometers. As far away as Sri Lanka, a thousand miles from the epicenter, the ground moved up and down by more than 9 centimeters (3.6 inches). Ground motions greater than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch), but too gradual to be felt, occurred everywhere on Earth's surface as seismic waves from the event spread around the globe. </p><p>The 10-minute duration of the rupture complicated the seismological analysis, Lay said. An earthquake generates many different kinds of seismic waves, including fast-moving P waves and slower-moving S waves. In an earthquake with a more typical duration of 30 seconds, S waves would start to arrive at seismic monitoring stations minutes after the P waves had passed. But in the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, the P waves were still coming when the S waves started to arrive, making it hard to sort out the signals.</p><p>"Nobody's algorithms were tuned to work with this kind of earthquake, so we had to take all of the methods we have applied successfully to smaller earthquakes and expand and adapt them for this earthquake that just went on and on," Lay said. </p><p>The new analysis gives the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake a seismic magnitude of at least 9.1, and possibly as high as 9.3. Earlier estimates had put it at magnitude 9.0. By comparison, the 1960 Chile earthquake was magnitude 9.5, and the 1964 Alaska earthquake was magnitude 9.2. The data from those earlier earthquakes are relatively limited, however, and small differences in magnitude may not be significant, Lay said.</p><p>For those who experienced California's 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake--a magnitude 6.9 event that caused major destruction from Santa Cruz to the San Francisco Bay Area--Lay noted that the ground shook more than 100 times harder during the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. Even some of the aftershocks were more powerful than the Loma Prieta quake.</p><p>"Even among seismologists, we call this a monster earthquake," Lay said.</p><p>The earthquake took place along the curving boundary between major plates of the Earth's crust, where the Indo-Australian plate plunges beneath the southeastern Eurasian plate. Before the fault ruptured, the edge of the Eurasian plate was being dragged downward by the descending Indo-Australian plate. Released by the rupture of the fault, the edge of the plate sprang back up, uplifting the ocean floor and setting off the tsunami that inundated coastal areas throughout the Indian Ocean. The fault slipped by as much as 15 meters (50 feet) in places, averaging about 10 meters (33 feet) of displacement along the segment off the northwestern tip of Sumatra where the quake was centered. </p><p>From the epicenter, the rupture expanded along the fault at a speed of about 2.5 kilometers per second (1.5 miles per second) toward the north-northwest. But the initial movement of the fault was much less along the northern segment than in the south. This was fortunate, because it spared much of the coastline in the north from the massive tsunami waves that caused so much destruction further south. Eventually, the northern part of the fault slipped about as much as the southern part, uplifting and tilting the Andaman Islands. The tilting of the islands shows that the northern part must have slipped about 10 meters, but much of that slip occurred gradually, without generating seismic waves.</p><p>"We think that slip was occurring in the northern part for about an hour, well after the 10 minutes of rapid motions were over," Lay said. </p><p>UCSC geophysicist Steven Ward generated models of the tsunami waves that document this long slip process. Ward used a unique recording of the tsunami spreading across the Indian Ocean obtained by a radar altimetry satellite (Jason) that happened to be passing overhead. The satellite data showed a trough in the central Bay of Bengal two hours after the earthquake, which is best explained by late slip beneath the Andaman Islands, according to Ward's tsunami models.</p><p>"The satellite image of the tsunami is quite exciting because such data open a new window through which earthquake rupture processes can be observed, and it also suggests that radar satellites might some day be able to provide direct real-time warning of an approaching tsunami wave," Ward said.</p><p>After the earthquake and the tsunami came the aftershocks, including the most energetic earthquake swarm ever observed. More than 150 earthquakes of magnitude 5 and greater occurred over a four-day period in late January on faults beneath the Andaman Sea that were activated by the rupture of the main fault along the plate boundary to the west. There were also numerous aftershocks of magnitude 6 and greater throughout the fault zone.</p><p>"It's an incredible aftershock series," Lay said. "It is hard to get a feeling for the scale of it. If you take the aftershock zone and superimpose it on California, it completely covers the state."</p><p>Then the March 28 earthquake struck with a magnitude of 8.6 on an adjacent portion of the plate boundary to the southeast. This was not an aftershock, but a new rupture of an adjacent segment of the fault. Now, concern about additional earthquakes is focused on the next area to the southeast, which last failed in a great earthquake in 1833. Major earthquakes could occur not only on the thrust fault along the plate boundary, but also on a related fault system beneath the island of Sumatra. Faulting on that system involves horizontal shearing, similar to the San Andreas Fault. </p><p>"The Sumatra Fault runs right down the length of the island. Because it is close to major population centers, the seismic hazard is significant even for a smaller event," Lay said.</p><p>Major faults elsewhere in the world--in northern Turkey, for example--have experienced sequences of earthquakes moving progressively along a fault line. </p><p>"When one part of the fault slides, that loads up the adjacent region and transfers stress. So you have a heightened potential for earthquakes on the adjacent section. The concern is that something like that could happen in Sumatra," Lay said.</p><p>The three papers published this week in Science and their authors are as follows:</p><p>"The Great Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake of 26 December 2004"</p><p>Thorne Lay (UC Santa Cruz), Hiroo Kanamori (California Institute of Technology), Charles Ammon (Pennsylvania State University), Meredith Nettles (Harvard University), Steven Ward (UCSC), Richard Aster (New Mexico Tech), Susan Beck (University of Arizona), Susan Bilek (New Mexico Tech), Michael Brudzinski (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Rhett Butler (IRIS), Heather DeShon (UW-Madison), Goran Ekstrom (Harvard), Kenji Satake (Geological Survey of Japan), Stuart Sipkin (U.S. Geological Survey).</p><p>"Rupture Process of the Great 2004 Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake"</p><p>Charles Ammon (Penn State), Ji Chen (Caltech), Hong-Kie Thio (URS Corp.), David Robinson (University of Oxford), Sidao Ni (University of Science and Technology of China), Vala Hjorleifsdottir (Caltech), Hiroo Kanamori (Caltech), Thorne Lay (UCSC), Samita Das (Oxford), Don Helmberger (Caltech), Gene Ichinose (URS Corp.), Jascha Polet (UC Santa Barbara), David Wald (USGS)</p><p>"Excitation of Earth's Free Oscillations by the 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake"</p><p>Jeffrey Park (Yale University), Teh-Ru Alex Song (Caltech), Jeroen Tromp (Caltech), Emile Okal (Northwestern University), Seth Stein (Northwestern), Genevieve Roult (IPGP, Paris), Eric Clevede (IPGP), Gabi Laske (UC San Diego), Hiroo Kanamori (Caltech), Peter Davis (UCSD), Jon Berger (UCSD), Carla Braitenberg (University of Trieste), Michel Van Camp (Royal Observatory of Belgium), Xiang'e Lei, Heping Sun, and Houze Xu (Chinese Academy of Sciences), Severine Rosat (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan)</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Lay at (831) 459-3164 or thorne@pmc.ucsc.edu and Ward at (831) 459-2480 or ward@es.ucsc.edu.</p><p>Additional Media Contacts:</p><p>  A'ndrea Messer, Pennsylvania State University, (814) 865-9481, aem1@psu.edu</p><p>  Janet Emanuel, Yale University, (203) 432-1333, janet.emanuel@yale.edu</p><p>  Robert Tindol, California Institute of Technology, (626) 395-3631, tindol@caltech.edu</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ed7698072704601a012ff9a0eda45"><name>694</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz engineering students develop a coral reef monitoring system</title><author>Françoise Chanut (831) 459-2495;

The apparatus they are building will track conditions on coral reefs in distant locations and beam information back in real time to a land-based station. </p><p>The students named their creation SEA-LABS, short for "Sensor Exploration Apparatus utilizing Low-power Aquatic Broadcasting System." SEA-LABS was originally designed to help UCSC biologist Donald Potts track environmental changes that affect the reefs of Midway, a remote atoll of the Hawaiian archipelago. But SEA-LABS also has the potential to become a low-cost tsunami-warning device, said Matt Bromage, a computer engineering student who acts as SEA-LABS team manager.</p><p>According to Potts, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, SEA-LABS should be a vast improvement over current satellite imaging technology, which provides low-resolution data at high cost. A typical satellite survey will provide average temperatures of the ocean surface over areas up to 60 square miles, he said. </p><p>"But the corals living on a reef may experience temperatures that are 5 to 10 degrees different from that average. With SEA-LABS, we will have miniaturized instrumentation that we can place right where the corals and other animals and plants actually live," Potts said. </p><p>The project began with a serendipitous encounter between Potts and Katia Obraczka, an associate professor of computer engineering whose research includes wireless sensor networks. Together they hatched the idea of a collaboration, which Obraczka proposed as a student project for the senior engineering design class. </p><p>Bromage and four classmates--electrical engineering senior Lee Wells and computer engineering seniors Chris Chan, Mike Maroney, and Jo Chou--volunteered. The students said they were attracted by the opportunity to build something that had practical applications and would have an impact. Now entering its final testing stages, the project should culminate this summer with a trip to the Midway atoll, 1,200 miles northwest of Honolulu, where the students will install and test their waterproof and salt-resistant prototype. </p><p>Wireless data transmission is a big advantage of SEA-LABS over other commonly used environmental sensors, Bromage said. "Currently, the state of the art for remote monitoring is a sensor attached to a data logger, but you need to go out and retrieve the logger after a set amount of time," he said. </p><p>Data loggers collect and store data but do not transmit it. SEA-LABS will send information in real time, first through a wireless connection to a land station on Midway, then through an Internet connection between Midway and the mainland. Ideally, traveling the 2,800 miles between Santa Cruz and Midway to service SEA-LABS would only be necessary once a year.</p><p>The core of SEA-LABS is a Programmable Ocean Device (POD), which consists of a processor, a memory storage component, and a battery that can last up to two years, all housed in a waterproof casing about the size of a small wastebasket. The POD can be bolted to the seafloor near a reef. It must be completely waterproof at depths up to 60 feet and sturdy enough to withstand heavy wave action.</p><p>The POD has cable connections to sensors that independently record pressure, light, salinity, and temperature. The sensors are small enough to fit in any desired location on or within a reef and can be placed right next to plants, corals, and other reef inhabitants. </p><p>The pressure sensors monitor wave patterns, tides, and overall sea levels. Eventually, real-time recordings from these sensors could be used to help detect a tsunami wave. </p><p>The POD connects to a receiver/transmitter attached to a surface buoy. The transmitter broadcasts the data recorded by the sensors from the POD to a base station on land via a radio antenna. The challenge for this step is to find a good compromise between signal strength and battery life, Obraczka said. </p><p>"You can always increase signal strength by increasing power, but then the battery will run out sooner," she said. </p><p>On the other hand, if the signal from the POD is too low, the land antenna might not be able to pick it up, which would result in incomplete data collections. With an antenna 150 feet above ground and transmitters on one-foot high buoys, SEA-LABS should work within a five- to seven-mile range. That range should accommodate the geography of the Midway reef, Potts said. But the final tuning of SEA-LABS will only be possible at Midway.</p><p>"The problem is that wireless transmission is very sensitive to the environment," Obraczka said.</p><p>The Midway atoll consists of three small islands surrounded by a well-developed reef. A U.S. Navy base for over 50 years, the atoll became a National Wildlife Refuge under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1996. Since then it has suffered minimal human impact, which makes it a good place to study ecological and evolutionary responses to changing natural conditions, Potts said.</p><p>The health of a reef depends on complex interactions between corals and algae, which themselves depend on water temperature, depth, salinity, and acidity. Potts expects the environmental impacts of global climate change to become detectable on Midway and its reef in the near future, but predicting what will happen is difficult.</p><p>"The physical environment is unpredictable and the climatic conditions unstable," Potts said. "As climatic conditions change, the patterns of winds, storms, currents, and upwellings will change at a regional scale." </p><p>An important goal of the SEA-LABS team is to provide technology that benefits users with small budgets, such as developing countries or U.S. wildlife reserves with limited government or private funding, Potts said. To this end, the students use off-the-shelf components and develop nonproprietary open-access software. Depending on the number of sensors attached to each POD, SEA-LABS should cost between $500 and $1,000 per POD. Eventually, mass production could lower the cost even further.</p><p>Though only two stations will be ready this summer, Potts would eventually like to install 10 stations along the Midway reef. According to Bromage, one of the best features of SEA-LABS is the ability of the PODS to communicate with each other and establish ad hoc networks. If a POD is too far from the base station, it can transmit its information to a nearby POD, which will relay it to another POD or to the base station.</p><p>The idea of the senior engineering design class is to mimic an industry environment, said computer engineering lecturer Stephen Petersen, who teaches the senior design class and advises SEA-LABS on radio frequency. While the students sharpen their engineering wits, they also learn to work as a team, a skill that will serve them well in future job settings. </p><p>And what happens to SEA-LABS after this summer, when the class graduates? </p><p>"We're hoping to pass it on to the next class so they can do something more sophisticated with it," Chan said. </p><p>_______</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Potts at (831) 459-4417 or <a href="mailto:potts@biology.ucsc.edu">potts@biology.ucsc.edu</a>, Obraczka at (831) 459-4308 or <a href="mailto:katia@soe.ucsc.edu">katia@soe.ucsc.edu</a>, and Bromage at (408) 718-8512 or <a href="mailto:mbromage@ucsc.edu">mbromage@ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p>This release is available electronically at the following web site: <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu">http://press.ucsc.edu</a>. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914ed8f68072704601a012ffa38edd99"><name>695</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fresh organic flowers and produce available at UCSC Farm Cart beginning June 7 </title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu </author><keywords>Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, UCSC Farm Cart, </keywords><start-date>1117004400000</start-date><display-name>Fresh organic flowers and...</display-name><path>/2005/05/695</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/695</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338117814</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338117814</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Pick up fresh vegies for dinner and grab a spring bouquet to brighten your home or workplace at the UCSC Farm Cart, which opens this year on Tuesday, June 7.</p>

Three students received $20,000 fellowships for interdisciplinary environmental research, and two students received $9,000 fellowships for biodiversity conservation research.</p><p>In addition to the graduate fellowships announced last month, the institute awarded smaller research grants to 20 graduate students and six undergraduates in January.</p><p>The STEPS Institute supports environmental research and policy through initiatives that aim to forge new collaborations among researchers at UCSC, policy makers, and environmental managers. The institute organizes workshops, provides fellowships and grants, and helps to establish new environmental research facilities on the UCSC campus.</p><p>The two fellowships in biodiversity conservation were awarded to Carolyn Kurle, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology who is studying the effects of introduced predators on intertidal communities in the Aleutian Islands; and Sara Bothwell, a graduate student in environmental studies who is investigating the effects of landscape diversity on populations of parasitic wasps that provide biological control of agricultural pests. </p><p>Formally known as the M.R.C. Greenwood Fellowship Award in Biodiversity Conservation, these $9,000 fellowships are supported by a generous gift from Diane and Donald Cooley, longtime supporters of UCSC. The fellowship award is administered by the STEPS Institute in collaboration with the UCSC Arboretum.</p><p>The other three fellowships were awarded to incoming graduate students Andrea Jani, Jae Pasari, and Autumn Lynn Harrison. These $20,000 STEPS fellowships are funded by an anonymous donor. </p><p>Jani will be working with Ingrid Parker, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Gregory Gilbert, associate professor of environmental studies, to study host-pathogen interactions and the relationships between disease dynamics, population ecology, and community ecology. Pasari will be working with Erika Zavaleta, assistant professor of environmental studies, to explore the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in Central Coast ecosystems. Harrison will study marine biology with Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p><p>Additional information about STEPS grants and fellowships and the recipients of the 2005 awards can be found online at <a href="http://www.steps.ucsc.edu">www.steps.ucsc.edu</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914edee28072704601a012ff5c7133fa"><name>700</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Professor Alan Richards to discuss Mideast at Foundation Forum June 2</title><author>Louise Donahue/831-459-2495</author><start-date>1116831600000</start-date><display-name>Professor Alan Richards to...</display-name><path>/2005/05/700</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/05/700</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338119345</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338119345</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz professor Alan Richards, who in late 2004 briefed the American military's Central Command on the Middle East, will address the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Forum on June 2.</p><p>Richards will speak on "American Thinking About Violence in the Middle East" at the 4 p.m. lecture in the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.

The Dickens Universe combines elements of a research symposium, arts festival, book club, and summer camp all rolled into one big, unforgettable week of intellectual celebration.</p><p>"When we started, we had no idea it would last this long or continue to grow as it has," observed John Jordan, director of the Dickens Project and professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz. </p><p>"I think it's been so successful because Dickens was a comic writer and a great storyteller," Jordan added. "He's a writer concerned with important social questions-poverty, hunger, child labor, homelessness, bureaucracy, class inequity, marriage, and the status of women. In addition to being a novelist, he was involved in all the social issues of his time and that fed into his work. So through the study of Dickens, we engage in an ongoing social commentary that is still relevant today."</p><p> </p><p>The 2005 Dickens Universe will focus on the novel Little Dorrit and culminate in a special weekend conference devoted to the topic "Dickens: Life and Afterlife." The Dickens Universe will run from July 31 to August 6, with the weekend conference overlapping from August 4 to 7. It will also include a number of special activities in honor of the 25th anniversary.</p><p>Jordan recalled the origins of the Dickens Project, which he began in collaboration with UC Santa Cruz professor of English and comparative literature Murray Baumgarten, and UC Riverside English professor Ed Eigner. </p><p>"When we met back in 1980 at Murray's home and sketched out the original idea for the project, we had two innovative distinctions in mind," Jordan noted. "We wanted to include members of the general public and not limit it to just faculty and graduate students. And we also wanted it to be different from our own personal experiences of graduate school-where you rarely got to know different faculty or graduate students on other campuses." </p><p>"There are not many multi-campus research units that exist in the humanities," Jordan added. "We're certainly among the oldest."</p><p>Founded in 1980 to stimulate collaborative research on the writings, cultural impact, and life of novelist Charles Dickens, as well as the Victorian age in general, the Dickens Project has gone on to cosponsor international conferences in Israel, France, South Africa, Italy, Great Britain, and Australia. It also publishes educational materials on Dickens and other Victorian writers and has produced three teaching resource kits in collaboration with the BBC--in addition to hosting numerous seminars and workshops for teachers, supporting the professional development of countless graduate students, and serving as an international clearinghouse for Dickens scholarship.</p><p>_____</p><p>For information about attending the 2005 Dickens Universe or "Dickens in the Classroom," an upcoming seminar at UC Santa Cruz for high school teachers to be held in June, contact project coordinator JoAnna Rottke at 831.459-2103 or dpi@ucsc.edu.
