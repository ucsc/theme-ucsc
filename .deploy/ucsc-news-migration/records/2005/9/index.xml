<p>Titled Connecting Arts and Community, the project will bring high-quality dance experiences to Santa Cruz County youth, their families, and other community members through performances and demonstrations by the internationally renowned David Dorfman Dance company. Activities will take place at county high schools and community youth organization sites.</p>
<p>"This grant is a tremendous opportunity for the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County and UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures to inspire local children by bringing world-class performances to high schools and community centers," noted Alberto Rafols, executive director of the Cultural Council. "It strengthens arts education in a time of dwindling school funding and presents a world of possibilities to the next generation of artists and audiences."</p>
<p>"It's an ideal partnership," added Michelle Witt, director of UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures program. "Arts &amp; Lectures has unique connections with artists, and the Cultural Council-through its SPECTRA Excellence in Arts Education program-has special knowledge of the schools and community."</p>
<p>The David Dorfman Dance company has performed extensively in New York City, and throughout North and South America, Great Britain, and Europe. David Dorfman and the company's dancers and artistic collaborators have been honored with seven New York Dance and Performance ("Bessie") Awards, including one for his community-based project, Familiar Movements (The Family Project). Dorfman's community projects are designed specifically to connect non-dancers with professionals, and to include such diverse groups as at-risk teens, schoolchildren, senior citizens, and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of its two-week residency in Santa Cruz, David Dorfman Dance will perform on March 10 and 11 at the UCSC Mainstage Theater as part of the Arts &amp; Lectures 2005-06 performing arts season.</p>
<p>The Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the arts in Santa Cruz County. For the past 26 years, the Cultural Council has provided arts education in local schools, encouraged cultural endeavors through grants to community arts organizations, assisted thousands of artists to market their work, developed facilities assistance for the arts, and educated the public about the importance of art and artistic diversity.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Cultural Council and UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures have been meeting to plan the project since May of 2004. The site list for residency activities at this date includes: Watsonville High School, Harbor High School, Scotts Valley High School, Pajaro Valley High School, the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Santa Cruz and Shoreline Middle School, and the Watsonville Charter School of the Arts.</p>

The board needs to expand its scope to incorporate the cumulative impacts of air pollution exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability into its regulatory decisionmaking, said Pastor.</p><p>"Environmental justice has become a major policy issue in California, but there are gaps in the way the state conducts research," said Pastor. "We can help develop rigorous, trustworthy, and cost-efficient methodologies to identify and assist vulnerable communities." </p><p>Based on evidence that environmental hazards are concentrated in poor and minority neighborhoods, environmental justice advocates seek redress for victims who suffer disproportionate exposure to hazardous substances like toxic waste, air pollution, and industrial runoff. Pastor and his team have developed innovative measures of exposure and effect that they are eager to share. An interagency group is currently developing environmental justice implementation guidelines for the California Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>"This is the time to work at the state level," added Pastor, codirector of UCSC's Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community.</p><p>Specifically, the CARB grant will enable Pastor's team to fill some of the data-gathering and analytical gaps faced by state regulators. Pastor and his colleagues will conduct statewide and regional studies to identify the key factors that explain existing patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in lifetime cancer and other health risks associated with outdoor air toxics exposure. Those results will help Pastor develop measures of cumulative impact and community vulnerability at the neighborhood level, with an eye toward guiding policy regarding protection, community participation, and educational outreach about air pollution. The project will also include a community-based "validation study" in the Oakland area to identify sources of emissions that may have gone undetected by CARB.</p><p>Community participation is essential, according to Pastor, who said it builds trust in the process and the final outcome. He also noted that tools developed by outside researchers to assess environmental equity will be useful to state agencies as they respond to community concerns.</p><p> </p><p>_____</p><p>For more on the environmental justice research efforts of Pastor, Sadd, and Morello-Frosch, see <a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring04/exposure.html">review.ucsc.edu/spring04/exposure.html</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f0d908072704601a012ff1eb7002c"><name>731</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Three universities collaborate to offer new doctorate for professional educators</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>education, partnerships, degree, doctorate</keywords><start-date>1126162800000</start-date><display-name>Three universities collaborate to...</display-name><path>/2005/09/731</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/731</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338131296</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338131296</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administration</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ten students have begun a new doctoral program in educational leadership offered jointly by the University of California, Santa Cruz; San Jose State University; and California State University, Monterey Bay.</p><p><table BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" align="RIGHT" border="0" cellpadding="3" valign="TOP" width="50%"><tr><td><b><font color="#333333">First 10 students enrolled in new program offered by UC Santa Cruz, San Jose State University, and Caifornia State University, Monterey Bay</font></b></td></tr></table>The UC Regents approved the new Doctor of Education Degree (Ed.D.) in Collaborative Leadership this summer. It has been in development for five years, said June Gordon, associate professor of education at UCSC and lead coordinator for the Santa Cruz campus. </p><p>"This degree is geared toward working professionals," said Gordon. "The goal is to prepare K-12 educators to lead educational transformation in the culturally and linguistically diverse schools of the region that encompasses Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties."</p><p>Among those enrolled this fall is Ralph Porras, assistant superintendent of Santa Cruz City Schools and the former principal of Santa Cruz High School and DeLaveaga School.</p><p>Students will take two courses per quarter year-round for three years. Classes will be offered at each of the three campuses on a rotating basis. The first courses were held at UCSC this summer; this fall, classes will be held at CSUMB, while winter and spring classes will take place on the San Jose campus; next summer, classes will again be held at UCSC. Participating campus units are the Education Department at UCSC, the College of Education at SJSU, and the College of Professional Studies at CSUMB. </p><p>The Ed.D. is geared toward practical, professional work, and dissertations are expected to have practical implications. "Students are expected to bring research topics to the table," said Gordon, adding that current topics include how to help second-language learners access quality education, how to respond to the demands of government policies and reforms, and how to increase the participation of low-income parents in educational decision making.</p><p>The three-campus collaboration offers students the benefits of both the UC and CSU system, said Gordon.</p><p>"San Jose State has tremendous strength in educational leadership, with an enormous teacher education program and strong roots in the community," said Gordon. "CSUMB brings a focus on interdisciplinary work, more theoretical faculty interests, and a great deal of enthusiasm about working with underserved students in the Seaside, Salinas, and Watsonville communities." UCSC professors offer research expertise and a focus on international populations and learning.</p><p>Each quarter, the two classes offered will be taught by instructors affiliated with different institutions. Twelve core faculty members, with four representatives from each campus, will provide the bulk of instruction. At UCSC, core faculty include Gordon and education professors Rodney Ogawa, Lucinda Pease-Alvarez, and Gordon Wells.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f0ee28072704601a012ffb91bed7a"><name>732</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MEDIA ADVISORY: UCSC faculty available to discuss aspects of Katrina aftermath</title><author>Tim Stephens and Jennifer McNulty, (831) 459-2495</author><start-date>1126249200000</start-date><display-name>MEDIA ADVISORY: UCSC faculty...</display-name><path>/2005/09/732</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/732</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338131631</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338131631</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A number of faculty from UC Santa Cruz are available to discuss aspects of the post-Hurricane Katrina story.

The UCSC grant will fund the training of three predoctoral fellows (graduate students) and three postdoctoral fellows each year. </p><p>The new program will draw from UCSC's strengths in computational genomics and basic biological research, providing fellows with a solid understanding of the biology of stem cells, the skills to use stem cells in their own research, and the ability to devise computational approaches and to integrate results from computational analyses into their own work. The program will underscore the value of stem cell research in developing therapies and cures for human disease.</p><p>David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UCSC, will serve as program director. Trainees will receive guidance from faculty mentors with a range of expertise in areas critical for advancing stem cell research. Faculty mentors from the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology as well as the Baskin School of Engineering will be involved in the program.</p><p>"This program reflects our commitment to interdisciplinary research and education at the interface of science and engineering, and it takes advantage of the fact that many of our faculty regularly work across the divisional boundaries," Haussler said.</p><p>The program will include a broad range of courses designed to offer a comprehensive education in stem cell science and ethics. Several new courses are planned, including an ethics course that will explore fundamental questions about the ethical, legal, and social implications of stem cell research.</p><p>The CIRM was established in 2004 with the passage of Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative. The statewide ballot measure provided $3 billion in funding for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions. Dispersal of these funds has been delayed, however, because lawsuits filed by opponents of the initiative currently prevent the CIRM from issuing bonds.</p><p>As a result, CIRM will fund the new program through bond anticipation notes (BANs), a form of bridge financing, which are designed to be purchased by philanthropic individuals and institutions. The financing team of the Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee (ICOC) plans to proceed with the first BANs issuance for this program in October. </p><p>"This is an exciting moment for the CIRM as these awards mark the first step in our scientific program of stem cell research--an accomplishment we have been able to achieve in less than one year as a state agency. The CIRM training program established today will be the most comprehensive training program to date in the field," said CIRM president Zach Hall.

The fall-quarter "move in" for students living on campus continues through Sunday, September 18. (See attached schedule for photo opportunities.)<br/>
<br/>

<p>Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body, new academic programs the campus is offering, and new buildings that are under construction:</p>
<p><strong>Enrollment:</strong></p>
<p>UCSC is expecting an average 2005-06 enrollment of 14,995 students; the projection for the fall quarter alone, historically the quarter with the most students, is 15,510.</p>
<p>Of those students enrolling in the fall, 14,010 are expected to be undergraduates; 1,500 are projected to enroll in graduate studies. Of the 14,010 undergraduates expected to enroll, approximately 4,050 will be new students (3,100 freshmen and 950 transfer students). These 4,050 new undergraduates were admitted from among nearly 23,000 applicants to UCSC.</p>
<p><strong>Profile of New Freshmen:</strong></p>
<p>The most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are in the many areas of the biological sciences, in business economics, and in psychology.</p>
<p>Approximately half of the freshmen have declared a major. The other half have expressed interest in a more general academic area of interest, having selected one of the following clusters: business and economics; education; environmental sciences; human psychology, culture, and society; information sciences, engineering, and technology; languages, literatures, and communication; liberal arts and area studies; life and health sciences; physical sciences and math; and visual and performing arts and media.</p>
<p>Of the 3,100 freshmen expected, more than 1,200 (39 percent) identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, American Indian, or Asian/Asian American. The average grade-point average (G.P.A.) of admitted freshmen is 3.69.</p>
<p><strong>New Academic Programs for UCSC Students:</strong></p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>o New Ed.D. in collaborative leadership (with San Jose State University and California State University, Monterey Bay)</p>
<p>Feminist Studies</p>

<p>o Music undergraduate minor name change to "Western art music"</p>
<p><strong>New Buildings/Other Infrastructure Projects:</strong></p>
<p>A number of construction projects are under way on campus and will continue through much of the 2005-06 academic year. The projects include:</p>
<p>o McHenry Library Expansion: After 10 years of planning, the McHenry Library Addition and Renovation Project will take a giant step toward reality as construction begins this fall. The expanded and renovated McHenry Library will provide increased space to better serve library users. Site preparation began last week with ground clearing in or very near the project footprint. The project, scheduled for completion in 2009, will provide the campus with an outstanding, architecturally designed building in a setting of terraced reading gardens, redwoods, and cherry trees.</p>
<p>o Kerr Hall: To prepare for the relocation of administrative offices resulting from the McHenry Library project, construction is occurring on Kerr Hall's interior and in its parking area. The relocation of offices is scheduled to take place by the beginning of January.</p>
<p>o Emergency Response Center: In order to consolidate campus emergency services, construction began several weeks ago on the Emergency Response Center, located in the south part of campus near the Carriage House and Women's Center. Construction is expected to take 18 months to two years.</p>
<p>o Hahn Student Services retrofit project: The Hahn Student Services Building will be undergoing seismic retrofit construction for the 2005-06 academic year. First-floor offices will be open and available, but there may be some rerouting of pedestrian and car traffic at times. Second-floor offices have relocated to Baskin Engineering or Kerr Hall for the duration of this project.</p>
<p>o Humanities and Social Sciences Facility: Underground utilities are almost completely installed, and foundations and grading are nearly completed for the Humanities and Social Sciences Facility, a three-building complex located north of Cowell College at the northwest corner of Hagar and McLaughlin Drives. The project is scheduled for completion in 2006.</p>
<p>o Physical Sciences Building: Work has resumed on this project, and the building is expected to be completed by spring 2006.</p>

The SCCBG Research Fellowship is an annual award of $10,000 to support a UCSC graduate student or postdoctoral researcher engaged in cancer-related research.</p><p>The group awarded the first SCCBG Research Fellowship to Jennifer Compton, a postdoctoral researcher studying genetic factors involved in breast cancer. The fellowship will support Compton's work with Gary Silberstein, a research scientist in UCSC's Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology. </p><p>The SCCBG, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last spring, raises funds for distribution to local cancer support groups and cancer research organizations. The new award represents the group's first gift to UCSC, where scientists are engaged in a broad range of cancer-related research projects. These include studies of the molecular mechanisms and genetic factors involved in cancer, as well as efforts to identify and synthesize new cancer-fighting compounds. </p><p>"A lot of people in our group were not even aware that UCSC is involved in cancer research. We are very excited about supporting this important research in our local area," said SCCBG director Jeni Brill. </p><p>Cancer research at UCSC is primarily sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and other major organizations such as the American Cancer Society. Silberstein, for example, has grants from the National Cancer Institute to support his research on genes involved in breast cancer. </p><p>The project that Compton will work on with funding from the SCCBG fellowship represents an important new direction for his research, Silberstein said. "This award enables us to launch a new area of research in our lab, so it's very important for us," he said.</p><p>Compton will be studying the "breast cancer predisposition gene" known as BRCA1. Mutations in this gene greatly increase the risk of breast cancer. Compton's research is aimed at understanding the normal role of BRCA1 in mammary tissue and the role of hormones in regulating the gene's activity. </p><p>"It is important to study the normal development of mammary tissue so that we can better understand what goes wrong in breast cancer," Silberstein said. "This is the kind of basic research that can lay the foundation for advances in cancer therapy." </p><p>Compton attended UCSC as both an undergraduate and a graduate student, earning B.A. and Ph.D. degrees in molecular, cell, and developmental biology. Since completing her Ph.D. in 2003, she has done postdoctoral research with chemistry professor Phillip Crews. Crews's laboratory is exploring the pharmacological potential of compounds derived from marine sponges and other marine organisms. Some of the novel compounds they have isolated have shown promise as potential cancer therapies. Other researchers in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry are working to synthesize these natural compounds. </p><p>"The search for new drugs and the effort to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer are complementary approaches that are both important," Compton said. "I feel fortunate to be getting experience doing both."</p><p>Although researchers at UCSC do not conduct clinical studies involving patients, the campus is active in many areas of basic biomedical research. UCSC received more than $14 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health last year, including grants to researchers in the Departments of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Environmental Toxicology, and Biomolecular Engineering. </p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Silberstein at (831) 459-2612 or silberstein@biology.ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f15d88072704601a012ffc4ec2238"><name>737</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus raises record $35.3 million in private gifts last year</title><author>Louise Donahue, (831) 459-2495; ldonahue@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1127113200000</start-date><display-name>Campus raises record $35.3...</display-name><path>/2005/09/737</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/737</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338133418</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338133418</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Administration</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Louise Donahue</name><title>Guest Writer</title><phone>459-5312</phone><email>ldonahue@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Led by grants promoting ocean research and drawing on strong support from alumni, private gifts to UC Santa Cruz reached $35.3 million during 2004-05.</p><p>"Across the range of disciplines, from social sciences, humanities, and the physical and biological sciences to arts and engineering, our donors are making a positive difference at UC Santa Cruz," said Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "We depend on their generosity and support, and are very grateful for it."</p><p>The total amount raised-a record for the campus-marked an increase of nearly 10 percent from the 2003-04 year.</p><p>Drawing the largest share of private support was a long-term collaborative research project studying and monitoring coastal ecosystems. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation together contributed more than $7 million to UC Santa Cruz for its role in the Partnership for Interdiscplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans. </p><p>Ocean research was the goal of another gift by the Moore Foundation, $4.1 million to establish a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Investigator in Marine Science. The investigator, professor of ocean sciences Jonathan Zehr, has done groundbreaking research on microorganisms that "fertilize" the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use (a process called nitrogen fixation). The Moore Foundation also gave $650,647 for a multidisciplinary project to determine the number and distribution of predators in the open ocean.</p><p>The largest single contribution was the $6.5 million in-kind gift from Texas Instruments of a large industrial facility and the 18.5-acre site surrounding it. The building, in Santa Cruz near the array of campus research facilities at Long Marine Laboratory, is well suited for classrooms, laboratories, and offices. </p><p>Foundation trustee Kit Mura-smith, who came to the campus as a re-entry student, contributed the largest single amount ever from a UC Santa Cruz graduate. Her $1.4 million charitable trust will be split between scholarships for re-entry students and the McHenry Library, the campus's main library. </p><p>Alumni support was impressive throughout the campus, with more than $1.7 million in reunion giving. Alumni also contributed $709,858 of the more than $2.7 million given to the Annual Fund. The Telephone Outreach Program, which contacts alumni as well as students' parents, raised nearly $1.2 million, a record for the second year in a row. </p><p>UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustees contributed more than $2.5 million to the campus.</p><p>McHenry Library drew support from many other sources, including $500,000 from the late Miller and Bunny Outcalt for the library's photography archives, and $150,000 from Professor Emerita Melanie J. Mayer to support local history research in Special Collections.</p><p>The Jack Baskin School of Engineering's Storage Systems Research Center received $1 million from Kumar Malavalli, cofounder of Brocade Communications and cofounder and CEO of InMage Systems, to establish the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems Research. </p><p>Two of the campus's community collaborations for promoting educational achievement, economic equity, and environmental justice received nearly $1 million from the W.

Haussler will receive an award of $50,000 and will deliver a public lecture as part of the prize ceremony to be held at Carnegie Mellon University in March 2006.</p>
<p>A Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, Haussler directs the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) at UCSC and is scientific codirector of the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3). He has done pioneering work in the fields of computational learning theory and bioinformatics. At UCSC, he has been instrumental in establishing strong and productive interdisciplinary interactions between computer scientists and molecular biologists.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Haussler introduced the use of powerful statistical models (hidden Markov models and related methods) to the analysis of biological sequences of DNA, RNA, and proteins. This work led to his involvement in the International Human Genome Project and his group's vital contribution to that project, providing a computational solution that allowed the completion of the first working draft of the human genome.</p>
<p>Haussler's group published the human genome sequence on the World Wide Web for public access and went on to develop and maintain the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). This interactive web-based "microscope" allows researchers to view analyzed and annotated genome sequences of humans and other organisms at any scale, from a full chromosome down to an individual nucleotide. Biomedical researchers throughout the world use this browser extensively as they seek to understand and use the vast amount of information contained in the genome sequences.</p>
<p>Haussler uses the tools his team created to conduct ongoing research in comparative and evolutionary genomics. His group has pioneered a computer-based, probabilistic process for analyzing the genome of one mammalian species by comparing it to the genomes of one or more other species. Algorithms his team developed have identified segments that have been extremely well conserved throughout millions of years of evolution. Evolutionary theory predicts that these "ultra-conserved" regions represent novel functional elements of the genome, but their exact function remains a mystery. The ongoing investigation of these ultra-conserved regions in Haussler's lab may lead to a better understanding of how the genome works.</p>
<p>In his most ambitious project, Haussler and his colleagues are using the genomes of living mammals to attempt to reconstruct by computer the entire genome of the common ancestor of all placental mammals. While this work is still in the very early stages, it has already generated considerable interest.</p>
<p>A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Haussler received the 2003 ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award, and R&amp;D Magazine named him "Scientist of the Year" in 2001.</p>
<p>The Dickson Prize was established by a gift to Carnegie Mellon University from the estate of Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Dickson to fund an annual prize to persons who have made outstanding contributions to science in the United States. Dr. Dickson was a prominent physician in the Pittsburgh area, and it was his wish to bring as much prestige and honor as possible to the university and to Pittsburgh with this prize. Since 1970, the university has awarded the Dickson Prize to prominent researchers in such areas as mathematics, cell biology, civil engineering, metallurgy, computer science, genetics, and physics.</p>

The survey results were published by econphd*net, an online resource for prospective graduate students in economics. </p><p>UCSC's high ranking in international finance--between Columbia University and New York University--is the result of a concerted effort to build excellence in international economics, said economics professor and former department chair Michael Hutchison, who is now interim dean of the Division of Social Sciences.</p><p>"These results reflect the work we've done to recruit top scholars and graduate students, and we are pleased to be at the top of the list," said Hutchison. "The Economics Department at UCSC has made a concerted effort over the past 15 years to develop complementary programs in the international field. The concentration of scholarly research and teaching in international economics has led to a highly distinguished program."</p><p>The department's focus on global economics, and the hiring of top international economists, set the stage for the doctoral program in international economics, which awarded its first Ph.D. in 1992. In addition, the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics (SCCIE) sponsors research, conferences, scholarly exchanges, and other activities.</p><p>Economics is the fastest-growing and one of the most popular undergraduate majors at UCSC. The department offers degrees in economics, business management economics, and global economics, as well as a joint degree in information systems management that is offered with the Computer Sciences Department, and a dual B.A./M.S. degree that offers a B.A. in economics in four years and a master's in applied economics and finance after a fifth year of study. A separate master's in applied economics and finance is also available.</p><p>_____</p><p>Editor's Note: Michael Hutchison is available at (831) 459-3212 or via e-mail at hutch@ucsc.edu.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f1cde8072704601a012ff78d6e32f"><name>742</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Humanities Division offers new seminars for local schoolteachers</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1127286000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Humanities Division offers...</display-name><path>/2005/09/742</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/742</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338135204</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338135204</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Since 2003, the UCSC Humanities Division's Teacher Scholar Program has offered a series of seminars each year to help local middle, junior, and high school teachers with curriculum enrichment. Presented in partnership with the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, the Salinas Union High School District, UCSC Extension, and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the program allows teachers to explore a variety of subjects in a university setting. </p><p>The seminars are led by UCSC professors and provide teachers with exposure to contemporary research in ways designed to enhance their teaching. There is no charge to teachers and a lunch is provided for the sessions, which are held on two separate days from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Associate professor of history Alice Yang Murray kicks off the 2005-06 series on September 21 with a seminar titled "Memories of World War II in the U.S. and Japan."</p><p>The program is the brainchild of history professor Gail Hershatter, director of UCSC's Institute for Humanities Research, and associate professor of literature Christopher Connery. It is modeled after a program at Harvard University based on the idea of a humanities center that would serve the broader community.</p><p>"There are about 40 of these programs located around the country," noted Rebecca Woomer, a graduate student in literature who is the program administrator for UCSC's Humanities in the Schools program. "Right now, we have the only Teacher Scholar Program in California due to various budget constraints."</p><p>Woomer added that the UCSC program gives humanities and social studies teachers the opportunity to come into contact with cutting-edge content in their fields, but lets them decide exactly how they want to translate that information into their classroom. And although the goal of the program is academic enrichment, a beneficial by-product is often lists of books and new resources for teachers and schools.</p><p>"The Teacher Scholar Program gives teachers some great details and specifics that go beyond the normal survey textbook," said Woomer. "For example, history professor Bruce Levine gave a seminar last year about new ways of looking at the Civil War. He brought in a lot of primary sources such as newspapers, political cartoons, and editorials.

The conference will explore our culture's fascination with body modifications that range from tattooing, piercing, and cutting, to anorexia, plastic surgery, organ transplants, and life-extension technologies.</p><p>Titled "Bodies in the Making: Transgressions and Transformations," the event will include five panels featuring presentations from 11 UCSC professors, six professors from other campuses, and four community members: a surgical nurse, a transsexual author and actress, a photographer, and a psychoanalyst. </p><p>"Our purpose is not to medicalize, pathologize, or moralize," noted IAFR director Helene Moglen, who holds a UC Presidential Chair in Literature and who is coordinating the conference with Nancy Chen, UCSC professor of anthropology, and Katharine Norwood, the IAFR's assistant director. "We will be considering the personal and social meanings of practices that, while extremely varied, are also intriguingly related." </p><p>"The conference is for academics and nonacademics," Moglen added. "The papers presented will be relatively short and designed for a general audience. We expect there to be lots of discussion and disagreement. This is an open event and we hope that community members will attend." </p><p>The conference will begin at 2:30 p.m. on Friday, October 14, at the Porter Sesnon Gallery with presentations about the photographs and performance art of Hannah Wilke, whose work will be exhibited. From the 1970s until 1993, Wilke produced art that examined the body and its representation--culminating with a stark, moving series of photographs of her face and body during her struggle and eventual death from cancer. </p><p>CUNY sociology professor Victoria Pitts will deliver the keynote address, "Beauty, Body Image and Psychosocial Power" on Friday evening at 7:30 p.m. at the Stevenson College Event Center. Pitts will draw on insights from her forthcoming book, Surgery Junkies: The Cultural Boundaries of Cosmetic Surgery, as well as her previous work, In the Flesh: The Cultural Politics of Body Modification (Palgrave/Macmillan, 2003).</p><p>Moglen said that the conference emerged from the recognition that in the 21st century, the body is experienced less as a fixed entity than as a changeable product and a project of technological, medical, and artistic invention. "There is a paradox at the heart of these body modification practices," Moglen noted. "On one hand, they are experienced as self-expressive and liberating; on the other, they can be seen as socially determined, economically driven, and culturally enmeshed." </p><p>The conference will include a panel on cosmetic surgery and the culture of tattooing. University of Kentucky professor Virginia Blum, the author of Flesh Wounds, will present a paper on cosmetic surgery in extreme-makeover reality shows. Richard Roullard, a local surgical nurse, will discuss his volunteer work in Asia with the organization Interplast, which serves clients who have no other access to plastic surgery. Aleshia Brevard, a local transsexual author and actress, will describe her production of her own transgender identity through surgery and tattooing, and Santa Cruz photographer Kelly Richardson will show and discuss her photographs, which document tattoo culture in Santa Cruz.</p><p> </p><p>A second panel will explore the relation of body and mind from cultural and historical perspectives. UCSC sociology professor Gabriela Sandoval will analyze the practice of self-cutting among Latina youth, while University of Washington anthropology professor Lorna Rhodes will consider the implications of self-cutting among men in maximum security prisons. Psychoanalyst Sheila Namir will address issues of bodily integrity and subjectivity from both sides of the psychoanalytic couch, and UCSC anthropology graduate student John Marlovits will draw on his research in Seattle to explore the cultural politics of public psychiatry and psychopharmacology. </p><p>During a panel on Saturday afternoon, Sharon Kaufman, professor of anthropology at UC San Francisco, will speak about organ transplants and life-extending medical practices; UCSC history of consciousness professor Donna Haraway will analyze the constitutive ties between human and animal bodies; Moglen will reflect on the processes of aging and trans-aging; and Maria Frangos, a UCSC graduate student in literature, will examine televised narratives of body modification and the quest for identity in reality TV.</p><p>Participants in the final panel on Sunday will explore intentional and unintentional body modification practices that are the result of war, torture, organ transplantation, and prosthetic technology. San Francisco anthropologist Steve Kurzman will examine armaments, bodies, and prostheses in the context of the war in Iraq, suggesting how that war affects our concept of bodies at home. UCSC anthropology professor Nancy Chen will also trace the circulation of cadaver bodies from prisons to plastination factories to exhibits such as the "Universe Within," a display of actual human bodies that has been touring the country to record crowds.</p><p>"Body modification is a phenomenon that spans generations," Moglen observed. "We are looking at these issues through a cross-generational lens and we expect to have a large cross-generational audience. It is clear that people of all ages have a lot to teach--and learn from--one another."</p><p>_____</p><p>The UCSC Body Modification Conference is free and open to the general public.

The Arboretum offers a wide range of plant selections, including drought-tolerant plants from Australia and South Africa, as well as California natives. Knowledgeable Arboretum staff and volunteers will be on hand at the sale to answer questions. </p><p>Among the new plants available this year is featherhead (Phylica pubescens), an attractive and unusual South African shrub with soft, golden foliage. The narrow leaves are covered with hairs, and feathery bracts surround the flowerheads at the tip of each branch. The whole bush appears to glow when its golden hairs catch the sunlight. </p><p>Another stunning plant available this year is swamp bottlebrush (Beaufortia sparsa) from Western Australia. This large shrub sports colorful, bright-orange flower clusters that are attractive to birds. </p><p>The sale will also feature several attractive cultivars of Correa, known as Australian fuchsias. A new variety with pink flowers, called 'Western Pink Star', is available this year. Some of the Australian fuchsias are good winter bloomers, and most will bloom well under oak trees.</p><p>A complete list of the plants available at the sale will be posted on the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">Arboretum's web site</a> by October 1. </p><p>The Arboretum's sale is held in conjunction with the fall plant sale of the California Native Plant Society. Both sales are open early (from 10 a.m. to noon) to members of the Arboretum Associates and the California Native Plant Society, and to the general public from noon to 4 p.m. Arboretum memberships will be available at the gate on the day of the sale. </p><p>For more information about the sale, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998.

Haney, one of the nation's most respected death penalty researchers, finds the answer in a set of procedures and practices that systematically "distance and disengage" those charged with deciding the fate of defendants. </p><p>Building on more than 25 years of his own and others' empirical research, Haney discusses the system of capital punishment as a whole and identifies the elements that skew the system to facilitate death sentences. Three factors emerge as pivotal: </p><p>	. <b>Jury selection</b>--Like Stevens, Haney is critical of the jury selection process in capital cases. By systematically screening out opponents of capital punishment, the process produces unrepresentative juries (current surveys show about 70 percent of respondents favor the death penalty) and juries that include a high concentration of people who are more inclined to convict defendants.</p><p> . <b>Sentencing instructions</b>--Numerous studies reveal that jurors do not understand the instructions they receive as they begin the sentencing phase of capital trials, particularly the concept of "mitigation," the legal grounds on which jurors can choose a life sentence rather than death. "Death becomes the default outcome when jurors don't understand the instructions they're given regarding mercy," said Haney.</p><p> . <b>Cultural and media myths about crime</b>--Print and broadcast news, as well as crime-based television dramas, exaggerate the rate of violent crime and demonize violent criminals without providing any real explanation of the forces that influenced their behavior, said Haney. As a result, the public knows little about the backgrounds of violent criminals and the factors that contribute to violent crime, including poverty, neglect, racial discrimination, and childhood abuse. "Media portrayals of violent criminals are neither neutral nor accurate, and they have helped to create an unprecedented level of punitiveness in our society," he said. "Most people lack firsthand experience with the criminal justice system but are immersed in these misleading messages and images. Many people believe capital punishment is necessary for public safety without understanding how the system really operates or the life circumstances of the defendants who are most often targeted by it."</p><p>Haney maintains that these factors work in concert to undermine the reliability of the criminal justice process and compromise the fairness of the outcome of capital cases. "The flaws that riddle the system combine and operate in tandem. They help enable people to participate in behavior--actions designed to take the life of another person--that many of them otherwise would reject and resist," he said.</p><p>Haney suggests the following reforms:</p><p>	</p><p> . <u>Education</u>--Public-opinion polls repeatedly indicate that the people most in favor of the death penalty are the least informed. "People believe the death penalty deters murder, yet there is no reliable evidence that it does," said Haney. "Many believe people sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole eventually will get out, although that does not happen." Haney would enlist journalists in an effort to educate the public about capital punishment, but he cautioned that reporters would have to educate themselves first to prevent amplification of inaccurate messages that are sometimes politically motivated. "Unfortunately, the death penalty has become so highly politicized that I'm afraid some politicians perpetuate these myths--knowing full well they are incorrect--simply because they believe these 'tough' stances will help them get elected," said Haney.</p><p>	. <u>Media coverage</u>--The media must work harder to provide a more accurate and balanced picture of the real causes of violence in our society. Reporters tend to rely on law enforcement and government sources for much of their crime coverage. "Reporters don't know where to look for the other side of the story, and the result is a one-dimensional, incomplete flow of information that's fed to the public," said Haney.  "Violence is most often perpetrated by people who are damaged by mistreatment and other traumas suffered earlier in life." Research by Haney and others indicates that the overwhelming majority of capital defendants come from abusive, impoverished backgrounds, and often there are signs early in their lives that they were troubled by these experiences.</p><p>	. <u>Jury instructions</u>--Building on recent opinions by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Haney would bolster the requirement that attorneys fully and completely investigate and present to jurors the social history of defendants during the sentencing process. In addition, to improve juror understanding of the concept of mitigation, Haney would revise the way instructions are written, not only to avoid the confusion that now plagues them, but also to minimize the dehumanization and distancing effects of the process.</p><p>When the U.S. Supreme Court reinstituted the death penalty in 1976, justices broadened the scope of evidence and stipulated that jurors must receive instructions that would guide their discretion as they weighed the defendant's fate. But current efforts fall far short, concluded Haney, who has coined the phrase "empathic divide" to describe the vast gap that separates jurors from defendants in capital cases. The empathic divide erodes the psychological barrier that, under normal circumstances, makes it exceedingly difficult for most people to participate in the taking of life. Without widespread reforms like those he has suggested, Haney is not hopeful that the divide will be bridged any time soon.</p><p>"Many jurors are forced to muddle through this life-and-death decision-making process confused about their duty and mired in inaccurate media-based stereotypes," said Haney. "To truly improve the reliability and fairness of the decision-making process in capital cases, overarching reforms would be needed to break down the network of social psychological forces that are at work."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to Journalists: Craig Haney may be reached at (831) 459-2153 or via e-mail at psylaw@ucsc.edu.

McGraw, Jr. Prize in Education today (Tuesday, September 27) for her pioneering work in new teacher professional development.</p><p>Also receiving the McGraw Prize this year were Barbara Taylor Bowman, cofounder of the Erikson Institute, and Sharon Lynn Kagan, Marx Professor of Early Childhood and Family Policy and associate dean for policy at Teachers College. Recipients, selected by a board of judges from a selection of nominees, receive a $25,000 award and a commemorative statuette. Past honorees include former First Lady Barbara Bush, former Governor James B. Hunt, Jr., and former U.S. Secretaries of Education Richard Riley and Rod Paige.</p><p>Moir was recognized for her leadership in the field of teacher induction and her development of a mentoring program that pairs novice teachers with veteran classroom instructors. Moir's mentoring model dramatically improves the retention rate of new teachers. Nationally, the dropout rate among new teachers is 50 percent after five years, compared to retention rates as high as 88 percent among participants in the New Teacher Center's mentoring programs.</p><p>"Support early in their career makes all the difference for new teachers, and we know that teacher quality is the single most important factor in student success," said Moir, a passionate advocate for equitable learning opportunities for all students.</p><p>Moir is the founding director of the <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org/">New Teacher Center</a>, which has become a national resource for new teacher training since opening its doors in 1998. The center focuses on improving student performance by increasing teacher retention and effectiveness.

Kliger to the position of campus provost and executive vice chancellor at UC Santa Cruz. Kliger, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry and former dean of physical and biological sciences, had served in the campus's number two administrative position on an interim basis since March. </p><p>Several other appointments to key administrative positions at UCSC were also announced by Chancellor Denice D. Denton this week. William A. Ladusaw, professor of linguistics, has been named vice provost and dean of undergraduate education. Ladusaw, who has held the position on an interim basis since July 2004, is a former college provost and department chair. Alison Galloway, professor of anthropology, has accepted the position of interim vice provost for academic affairs. A leading scholar in her field, Galloway has served as chair of the Department of Anthropology and chair of the Academic Senate.</p><p>As campus provost and executive vice chancellor, Kliger is responsible for the day-to-day academic and administrative operations of UCSC, including long-term planning for the campus community, oversight of the UCSC budget, and advising Chancellor Denton on all campus issues. </p><p>Noting Kliger's extensive experience, Denton said, "David Kliger is an exceptional leader whose knowledge of UC Santa Cruz and proven leadership will greatly benefit our students, staff, and faculty. We are lucky to have him."</p><p>Kliger brings a record of scholarly achievement and administrative experience to this position, including service as dean of physical and biological sciences for more than 14 years. Kliger joined the UCSC faculty in 1971 and has served as chair of his department, chair of the Academic Senate, and chair of the senate's Committee on Academic Personnel. He was appointed dean of the Division of Natural Sciences (now Physical and Biological Sciences) in 1990. </p><p>Kliger's research career has straddled the boundaries of chemistry, physics, and  biology. He has developed new ultrasensitive analytical techniques and has used them  to study the chemical structures and functions of a variety of protein molecules. Kliger received his B.S. in chemistry from Rutgers University and his Ph.D. in chemistry  from Cornell University. </p><p>_____</p><p>A photo of David Kliger can be downloaded from the web at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/">www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press/photos/</a>.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f25038072704601a012ffe8422f3d"><name>748</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Three UCSC professors and two graduate students honored for teaching</title><author>Contact: Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>rogoff, bertram, pandey, awards, teaching, students, graduate</keywords><start-date>1127977200000</start-date><display-name>Three UCSC professors and...</display-name><path>/2005/09/748</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/748</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338137300</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338137300</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value><value>Psychology</value><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>SANTA CRUZ, CA--Three professors and two graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, were honored for their teaching today (Thursday, September 29).</p><p>The Division of Social Sciences presented the division's Distinguished Teaching Award, known as the "Golden Apple Award," during the dean's annual fall convocation. The awards recognize outstanding undergraduate teaching in the social sciences; each award carries with it a $500 cash prize and an engraved plaque. Recipients are:</p><p>. Barbara Rogoff, professor of psychology</p><p>. Eva Bertram, assistant professor of politics</p><p>. Triloki Pandey, professor of anthropology</p><p>"At UCSC, we pride ourselves on the quality of instruction we offer, and these awards recognize some of the best teachers we have," said Michael Hutchison, interim dean of the Social Sciences Division. </p><p>Rogoff, a leading developmental psychologist, has spent more than 25 years exploring how children learn. Her work has helped illuminate the extent to which notions of human development are culturally defined. Bertram specializes in American politics, including welfare and social policy, the politics of work, and drug-control policy. Pandey's areas of research include the religion and politics of the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest and the tribal peoples of Himalayan Terai and northeast India. </p><p>The Golden Apple Award is presented annually to as many as three faculty members. The recipients were selected by Hutchison from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee is chaired by Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies. The annual awards were established in 1991. </p><p>In addition, recipients of the 2005 Milam-McGinty-Kaun Award for Distinguished Teaching by graduate students were announced. Recipients are: </p><p>. Kuntal Das, a doctoral candidate in economics</p><p>. Paul Held, a doctoral student in politics</p><p>Named after David Kaun, the professor of economics who endowed the award, and the first recipients, Garrett Milam and Matt McGinty, the award honors graduate students in the fields of anthropology, economics, education, environmental studies, politics, psychology, and sociology. Each year, one recipient from economics and one student in another field receive $1,000 each.</p><p>Kaun established the award in 2000 with a $50,000 gift to the campus. Milam and McGinty were teaching assistants in Kaun's Intermediate Microeconomic Theory course.</p><p>#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f264e8072704601a012ff9ba370d9"><name>749</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Faye Crosby receives top honor in social psychology, becoming third UCSC professor to win prestigious Kurt Lewin Award</title><author>Contact: Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>faye crosby, awards, psychology, kurt lewin, brewster smith, tom pettigrew</keywords><start-date>1127890800000</start-date><display-name>Faye Crosby receives top...</display-name><path>/2005/09/749</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/749</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338137621</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338137621</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>SANTA CRUZ, CA--Faye J. Crosby, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an expert on affirmative action, has received the Kurt Lewin Award, one of the most prestigious honors in social psychology.</p><p>Crosby received the award from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI), also known as Division 9 of the American Psychological Association, a nonprofit organization of psychologists and social scientists that supports research on the psychological aspects of social issues.</p><p>Named for the late Kurt Lewin, the founder of social psychology, the Lewin Award is presented annually to recognize "outstanding contributions to the development and integration of psychological research and social action." </p><p>Crosby is a leading authority on affirmative action and diversity issues in education and business. Her most recent book is <i>Affirmative Action is Dead: Long Live Affirmative Action</i>. Among her many volumes is <i>Psychology and Management of Workplace Diversity</i>, which she coedited with Peg Stockdale.</p><p>Specializing in social justice, Crosby has focused on individual attitudes in the context of social change. She discovered the phenomenon known as "the denial of personal disadvantage," whereby people see themselves as exempt from the injustices that affect groups with which they identify. Crosby came to UCSC in 1997 from Smith College. She was on the faculty at Yale University from 1977 to 1985.</p><p>Crosby is the third UCSC psychology professor to receive the Kurt Lewin Award. M. Brewster Smith received the award in 1986, and Thomas Pettigrew received the honor in 1987. Crosby's award was presented during the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in August.</p><p>"Professor Crosby has made major contributions to contemporary scholarship, and her research accomplishments are matched by her excellence as a teacher," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "She is in good company, joining her UCSC colleagues Brewster Smith and Tom Pettigrew."</p><p>Crosby also received the Distinguished Publication Award from the Association for Women in Psychology for coediting a special issue of the <i>Journal of Social Issues</i> called "The Maternal Wall" that focused on work-family balance. Crosby received the same award last year for an article she coauthored with two UCSC graduate students and a colleague from the College of Wooster, entitled "Affirmative Action: Psychological Data and the Policy Debates."</p><p>She is currently chair of the UCSC Academic Senate. "I'm happy to work hard for the community of UCSC scholars because UCSC is such a fantastic school filled with people who combine excellent research with outstanding teaching," said Crosby. "And here we really do achieve excellence through diversity."</p><p></p><p>#####</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f279a8072704601a012ffdab5c709"><name>750</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>History professor's research questions common assumption of irresolvable conflict between Christians, Muslims, and Jews</title><author>Scott Rappaport  (831) 459-2496; srapp@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1127890800000</start-date><display-name>History professor's research questions...</display-name><path>/2005/09/750</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/750</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338137942</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338137942</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-2496</phone><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz associate professor of history Brian Catlos has spent years researching how Christians, Muslims, and Jews interact. Although his main focus has been on studying ethnic and religious minorities in the Mediterranean during medieval times, Catlos has inadvertently discovered a pattern running throughout history that applies directly to present-day political and social realities.</p><p>"Where my research and data leads, though not intentionally, is to debunk the notion of a conflict of civilizations--a conflict between groups of people who identify themselves as Christians, Jews, or Muslims and who articulate their struggle as a result of ideology and national identity," said Catlos. "Rather what's really behind history and contemporary human affairs is the interest of relatively small groups who often interact without regard to ideologies, national, or religious boundaries."</p><p>"Social stability, particularly between members of different cultural groups, seems to be related to the degree to which people depend on each other and fulfill each other's needs, "Catlos added. "When you have that situation, individuals cease to identify themselves primarily or exclusively as Christians, Muslims, and Jews."</p><p>Catlos noted that while the Middle Ages were certainly very different from today, he has found that the same basic social principles still operate.</p><p>"When groups engage in hostilities, we tend to categorize it as a struggle between religions," said Catlos. "For example, the struggle between the United States and Al-Queda--we're told it's a struggle between Western culture and Islamic culture. Yet if you look in the New York Times, you can see a photo of George Bush and Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia holding hands at Crawford Ranch. It's a misguided analysis and much more complicated than that. What we have in the world today--as in the medieval era--is a situation where individuals prefer to identify themselves as members of cultural communities, for example, as Christians, Muslims, and Jews, when they are in fact pursuing economic and political interests related to their own ambitions." </p><p>The author of a recent book titled The Victors and the Vanquished: Christians and Muslims in Catalonia and Aragon, 1050-1300 (Cambridge University Press, 2004), Catlos came to UCSC in 2002 after spending six years in Barcelona where he was a research fellow at the Spanish National Research Council and held a postdoctoral fellowship through Boston University. He has just been granted advance tenure and awarded a $25,000 grant from the UC President's Research Fellowships in the Humanities to continue his work in the coming academic year.</p><p>"I'm looking at empirical data gathered in the archives and developing a theory to apply outside the Middle Ages and the Mediterranean--to come up with a model for understanding under what circumstances members of different religious and political groups bring their religion into the forefront," said Catlos. "For example, Bosnia and Kosovo have become the poster children for ethno-religious intolerance. Yet in the years prior to the war there, the same area was remarkable for political, religious, and ethnic integration. I'm interested in looking at why and under what circumstances we get that shift from social stability to instability."</p><p>Catlos observed that engaging in this type of historical research is his way of testing common assertions that there is a fundamental and irresolvable conflict between Christian and Muslim, or Jewish and Muslim cultures. He points out that throughout history, there has been a widespread phenomenon of elites interacting with whoever will serve them best.</p><p>"Ethnicity and religion becomes the language with which we speak about our aims and politics, but I don't think it's what's actually behind them," said Catlos. "We have to critically analyze the present in the same way that we critically analyze the past."</p><p>"The message is for us to keep focused on what's happening and read beyond the official histories--whether we're talking about the Middle Ages or the present," said Catlos. "We should not accept at face value those appealing, simplistic analyses. They are ultimately wrong, but we tend to be attached to them because they're so self-affirming of our beliefs," he added.</p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="914f2fde8072704601a012ffff5b9912"><name>755</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Annual Harvest Festival at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, October 8</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><start-date>1126508400000</start-date><display-name>Annual Harvest Festival at...</display-name><path>/2005/09/755</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/755</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338140076</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338140076</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With toe-tappin' music, hay rides, pumpkin painting, and delectable edibles, the annual UC Santa Cruz Harvest Festival is always a great way to celebrate the changing of the seasons.

This theory faced a challenge in 2003, when a team of astronomers reported a surprising absence of dark matter in elliptical galaxies. But a new analysis published in the September 29 issue of the journal Nature provides an explanation for the earlier observations that fits comfortably with the standard theory and puts the dark matter back into elliptical galaxies. </p><p>"These are very normal, nearby elliptical galaxies that they studied, and if those galaxies don't have dark matter it calls into question the whole theory of cold dark matter," said Joel Primack, professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a coauthor of the Nature paper. </p><p>"A dearth of dark matter in elliptical galaxies is especially puzzling in the context of the standard theory of galaxy formation, which assumes that ellipticals originate from mergers of disk galaxies," added Avishai Dekel, professor of physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and first author of the Nature paper.  </p><p>"Massive dark matter halos are clearly detected in disk galaxies, so where did they disappear to during the mergers?" said Dekel, currently a visiting researcher at UCSC.</p><p>Primack, one of the originators and developers of the cold dark matter theory, uses supercomputers to run simulations of galaxy formation and the evolution of structure in the universe. The new paper used simulations of galaxy mergers run last year by Thomas J. Cox, then a graduate student working with Primack at UCSC and now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University. </p><p>The simulations show that the observations reported in 2003 are a predictable consequence of the violent galactic mergers that give rise to elliptical galaxies, Primack said. The simulations were analyzed by Dekel, Felix Stoehr, and Gary Mamon at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris, where Dekel holds a Blaise Pascal International Chair. UCSC graduate student Greg Novak also contributed to the analysis. </p><p>Elliptical galaxies are thought to form when two spiral galaxies collide and merge. Whereas spiral galaxies are dominated by flattened, rotating disks of stars and gas, elliptical galaxies are round, smooth collections of stars. </p><p>Evidence for dark matter halos around spiral galaxies comes from studying the circular motions of stars in these galaxies. Because most of the visible mass in a galaxy is concentrated in the central region, stars at great distances from the center would be expected to move more slowly than stars closer in. Instead, careful observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotational speed of stars in the outskirts of the disk remains constant as far out as astronomers can measure it. </p><p>The reason for this, according to cold dark matter theory, is the presence of an enormous halo of unseen dark matter surrounding the galaxy and exerting its gravitational influence on the stars. Additional support for dark matter halos has come from a variety of other observations.</p><p>In elliptical galaxies, however, it has been difficult to study the motions of stars at great distances from the center. The 2003 study (A. J. Romanowsky et al., Science 301:1696-1698) focused on bright planetary nebulas in the outer parts of four nearby elliptical galaxies. Planetary nebulas are old stars that have blown off their outer layers and glow brightly in characteristic wavelengths of light. The researchers were able to determine the line-of-sight velocities of large numbers of planetary nebulas in these elliptical galaxies. They found a decrease in the velocities with increasing distance from the center of the galaxy, which is inconsistent with simple models of the gravitational effects of dark matter halos.</p><p>Part of the explanation put forth in the new Nature paper lies in the fact that the velocities were measured along the line of sight. "You cannot measure the absolute speeds of the stars, but you can measure their relative speeds along the line of sight, because if a star is moving toward us its light is shifted to shorter wavelengths, and if it is moving away from us its light is shifted to longer wavelengths," Primack explained.</p><p>This limitation would not be a problem if the orbits of the observed stars were randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight, because any differences resulting from the orientations of the orbits would average out over a large number of observations. According to Cox's simulations, however, the stars farthest from the center of the galaxy at any given time are likely to be moving in elongated, eccentric orbits such that most of their motion is perpendicular to the line of sight. Therefore, they could be moving at high velocities without exhibiting much motion toward or away from the observers.</p><p>To understand why, it is necessary to look at what happens to the stars during galaxy mergers. As the merging galaxies interact, the stars themselves do not collide because they are separated by great distances, so the two galaxies essentially pass through one another. But the huge gravitational fields of the galaxies cause powerful tidal disturbances. Some of the stars are flung outward in extended tidal tails as the cores of the galaxies pass close by one another and spin apart. Sometimes the cores remain connected by a tidal bridge of stars and gas. Eventually, gravity pulls the cores back together, and the stars that were flung outward fall back in toward the center. </p><p>"In the merger process that produces these galaxies, a lot of the stars get flung out to fairly large distances, and they end up in highly elongated orbits that take them far away and then back in close to the center," Primack said.</p><p>To an observer outside the galaxy, a star on such an elongated orbit would only appear to be far from the galactic center if the long axis of its orbit is more or less perpendicular to the observer's line of sight. If the long axis of the orbit is aligned with the line of sight, the star would always appear to be in the crowded center of the galaxy from the perspective of the observer.</p><p>"If we see a star at a large distance from the center of the galaxy, that star is going to be mostly moving either away from the center or back toward the center. Almost certainly, most of its motion is perpendicular to our line of sight," Primack said.</p><p>The simulated mergers involved typical spiral galaxies, each embedded in a halo of cold dark matter. The simulations followed the gravitational and hydrodynamic evolution of the merger systems, taking into account the complicated feedbacks from star formation, supernovae, and the heating and cooling of gases in the galaxies. Each simulation was then "observed" from three different directions and at two slightly different times after the merger. </p><p>From more than 200 merger simulations run by Cox on a supercomputer at UCSC, the researchers analyzed 10 mergers that yielded elliptical galaxies with masses similar to those of the galaxies observed in 2003. The results were completely consistent with the reported observations, Primack said. </p><p>"Our conclusion is that what they saw is exactly what the cold dark matter model would predict," he said. "Their data are great, and this actually gives us more insight into how elliptical galaxies form."</p><p>"We predict that other velocity tracers in the same elliptical galaxies will show higher velocities if they are less concentrated toward the galaxy center or if they move on more circular orbits," Dekel said. "This is likely to be the case for compact star clusters, which are also observable in the outskirts of elliptical galaxies."</p><p>_____</p><p>Note to reporters: You may contact Primack at (831) 459-2580 or joel@scipp.ucsc.edu and Dekel at dekel@phys.huji.ac.il or (831) 459-2329. </p><p></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="915044368072704601a012ff2a69d67a"><name>942</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC swim team prepares for 12-hour swim across Monterey Bay on Sept. 30</title><author>Jennifer McNulty (831) 459-2495; jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</author><keywords>swim, sports, athletics, donor, transbay</keywords><start-date>1126681200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC swim team prepares...</display-name><path>/2005/09/942</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/942</link><created-by>andre</created-by><created-on>1282338210825</created-on><last-modified-by>andre</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282338210825</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Sports</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title>Staff Writer</title><phone>459-4399</phone><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a grueling test of their endurance, 12 hearty members of the UC Santa Cruz swim team will forsake their pool with a view and plunge into Monterey Bay on September 30 for the seventh annual transbay swim. </p><p>Accompanied by two kayaks and two support boats, the swimmers will take the plunge at the Santa Cruz Harbor and endure water temperatures in the 40s and 50s, the threat of sharks, and the "spooky" feeling of being far from shore before emerging nearly 12 hours later in Monterey.</p><p>It's a tough fundraiser, but UCSC swim coach Kim Musch said that's part of the idea.</p><p>"It's so hard and so miserable that you can't help but have an incredible bonding experience," said Musch. The Slugs hope to raise as much as $10,000 from private donors and local businesses, who underwrite the swim.</p><p>"It's way different from swimming in a pool or even swimming along the shore," said Musch. "Conditions can get a little rough sometimes, and when you get out in the middle of the bay, it gets a little spooky. You're a long way from shore, and it's weird to see a pod of whales or a giant sunfish, or a blue shark surface and come right at you."</p><p>Nevertheless, he said, the team has always completed the 26-mile relay. Swimmers typically take 20-minute shifts in the water, with kayakers paddling alongside. Support boats carry swimmers and paddlers. Swimmers even vie for a chance to participate, with spots going first to seniors, then juniors, noted Musch, who faces an endurance test of his own: "We hit the water at first light, and once they get to Monterey, the swimmers get to go home. I have to sail back, so I won't make it back to Santa Cruz until two or three in the morning!"</p><p>#####</p><p>If you want to support the UCSC Slugs transbay swim, contact team member Jennifer Kruse at jkruse@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="a27b60918072704601a012fff295cb8b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626248739</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626248739</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="a27b60918072704601a012fff295cb8b"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1232355600000</start-date><path>/2005/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2005/09/index</link><created-by>leslieg</created-by><created-on>1282626248739</created-on><last-modified-by>leslieg</last-modified-by><last-modified>1282626248739</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
