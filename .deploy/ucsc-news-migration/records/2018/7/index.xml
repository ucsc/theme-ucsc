<p>Hurricane Fabio in the eastern north Pacific will generate a moderate-height, long-period southerly swell over the coming days. This "swell train" will move into the coastal waters of the Monterey and San Francisco bay areas early Thursday. The largest waves are forecast to arrive late Thursday into early Friday.</p>
<p>A Beach Hazards Statement has been issued for the entire coast from Monterey to Sonoma County. It will be in effect from late Wednesday through Saturday afternoon. South-facing coastal sections of Marin and Santa Cruz counties are expected to be heavily impacted. Among the most dangerous areas: Stinson Beach in Marin County, and Santa Cruz Main Beach and Twin Lakes Beach in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>WAVES AND SURF: Expect a southerly swell or 4 to 7 feet with a period of 16 to 18 seconds.</p>
<p>HAZARDS: Expect Increased risk of rip currents and sneaker waves, stronger currents along west-facing beaches, and somewhat larger breaking waves at south-facing coasts.</p>
<p>TIMING: "Forerunning" waves will arrive late Wednesday through early Thursday. Larger waves will arrive later Thursday into Friday. Waves will diminish through the day Saturday.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Increased risk of drowning or being pulled out to sea.</p>
<p>Remember to never turn your back on the ocean. Have a safe and happy holiday!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>UC Santa Cruz Office of Emergency Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6b6a603e807270175cb4ed6bc2dac150"><name>qian-career-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer engineer Chen Qian wins NSF CAREER Award</title><summary>NSF funding supports Qian's research on new memory-efficient and ultra-fast network algorithms and protocols.</summary><keywords>Chen Qian</keywords><start-date>1530774000000</start-date><display-name>Computer engineer Chen Qian wins NSF CAREER Award</display-name><path>/2018/07/qian-career-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/qian-career-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1530810489760</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1530810613448</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Karyn Skemp</name><title></title><phone/><email>kskemp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/chen-qian.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/chen-qian.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chen-qian.jpg</name><display-name>chen-qian.jpg</display-name><file-size>51023</file-size><width>250</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Chen Qian</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/chen-qian-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/chen-qian-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chen-qian-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>chen-qian-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17522</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Chen Qian</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Chen Qian</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Research will investigate new memory-efficient and ultra-fast network algorithms and protocols</article-subhead><article-text><p>Chen Qian, assistant professor of computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The CAREER award will provide $500,000 in funding over five years.</p>
<p>Qian&#8217;s project, &#8220;Othello Hashing and Its Applications to Scalable and Dynamic Network Forwarding and Functions,&#8221; seeks to find high-speed, low-cost solutions for computer networks.</p>
<p>Today, devices of all kinds are being connected to computer networks. Computers, &#8220;smart&#8221; phones, &#8220;smart&#8221; appliances, and a myriad of other devices in a network are expected to operate efficiently and to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>Qian&#8217;s research is on designing new protocols and algorithms that are scalable to a very large number of computers and devices but still cost very little in the way of resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two ways we can add large numbers of new computers to a network,&#8221; Qian said. &#8220;One way is to invest in more expensive routers and devices, which have more memory and computing power. The other way is to design better network algorithms and protocols that improve throughput and don&#8217;t rely on massive amounts of memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Qian&#8217;s solution takes the latter approach and relies on a new network algorithm called &#8220;Othello Hashing,&#8221; developed by Qian and his colleagues. With Othello Hashing, Qian will investigate important network &#8220;primitives,&#8221; including load balancing, private data access, and distributed data placement.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Qian&#8217;s research also has applications to molecular biology and genomics. The algorithms he has developed have increased the speed of RNA sequence searches by 20 times.</p>
<p>The CAREER awards are the NSF&#8217;s most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research.</p>
<p>Qian has made key contributions in the areas of computer networks, network security and privacy, and mobile and pervasive computing. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6c786c05807270175cb4ed6b0a7431a4"><name>casfs-bouquets</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Learn how to grow and assemble beautiful bouquets</title><summary>Learn how to create beautiful homegrown organic flower arrangements at a lecture and demonstration workshop on July 15.</summary><start-date>1530774000000</start-date><display-name>CASFS-Bouquets</display-name><path>/2018/07/casfs-bouquets</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/casfs-bouquets</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1530828187568</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1530897140011</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/casfs-bouquets-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/casfs-bouquets-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>casfs-bouquets-400.jpg</name><display-name>casfs-bouquets-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>81618</file-size><width>400</width><height>533</height></image><image-alt>Bouquet of flowers</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/casfs-bouquets-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/casfs-bouquets-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>casfs-bouquets-80.jpg</name><display-name>casfs-bouquets-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>5250</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Bouquet of flowers</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Learn how to create beautiful arrangements of homegrown organic flowers at a lecture and demonstration workshop offered by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden.</p>

And this spring and summer, the Yeongang Gallery has been featuring <em>Global Station: Until the Next Voyage</em>, a solo exhibition by UC Santa Cruz art professor Jimin Lee, running April 19 to July 30.<br/><br/>&#8220;This is a truly unique art venue and first-ever art gallery within the civilian control line between the two Koreas,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;The gallery, with an air-raid shelter next door, was once a security exhibition center before its recent renovation into an art gallery.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;The outside of the gallery is covered with draped canvases of printed scenery images of Yeoncheon County by the artist who previously exhibited there,&#8221; Lee added. &#8220;The other part of the outside of the gallery is covered with 'Door of Peace', a wall created by over 100 louvered doors that expresses the people&#8217;s urge to freely travel to and from both sides of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL).&#8221; <br/><br/>For her exhibition, Lee selected about 35 original print works she began creating in 2013 that explore themes of the movement of the body and objects in space--in reference to migration, globalization, transportation, and mobility. <br/><br/>The show also includes a site specific collaboration titled &#8220;Yeoncheon&#8221; with composer Frank Harris and multimedia artist Aza Raskin. It features an original music score and video incorporating Lee&#8217;s prints, made with custom self-modifying video filters.<br/><br/>Lee noted that Yeongang Gallery and nearby Taepung Observatory are major tourist spots in the DMZ area. Since visitors have to leave their ID cards or passports at the checkpoint, she said she will be able to learn how many people might attend the exhibition, estimating about 1,000 to 1,500 visits per week, both from domestic and overseas tourists. <br/><br/>&#8220;Being a native Korean, the title of my exhibition--'Global Station: Until the Next Voyage'--came from my lifelong wish: a hope that this DMZ area would one day become a hub to link and reconnect the deeply divided country, people, networks, transportations and other physical infrastructures,&#8221; said Lee.<br/><br/>&#8220;I am thrilled to have an invitational solo show in the only art venue in this heavily armed border zone,&#8221; she added. &#8220;After visiting the DMZ, I was struck by the irony that this venue was actually very peaceful and within tranquil surroundings. Unexpectedly, I observed a very preserved and natural environment, and the gallery itself was surreal looking amidst the hidden paradise. I have shown my work actively around the globe, but I feel this might be the most unique art venue I have ever exhibited in.&#8221;<br/><br/>Lee said she was excited to learn that the leaders of North and South Korea had a historical meeting just one week after her exhibition opened in the DMZ. <br/><br/>&#8220;Coincidently, I had my first solo exhibition entitled &#8216;Somewhere/Irgendwo&#8217; in Berlin last March at a gallery located in the &#8220;old&#8221; East Berlin. During that exhibition, I met some artists and visitors, and some of them shared with me interesting and emotional stories of their own experiences of isolation from friends and family. I was moved to hear a story about the historical David Bowie concert and how it played a role in triggering an East German rebellion. After the reunification of Germany, the German government began supporting the arts more--and in many diverse ways--which helped resolve and ease the numerous and ongoing frictions and conflicts between the two old partitions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Holding this exhibition during a moment of possible political and historical change is really special,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Even though I don&#8217;t define my art as &#8216;political art,&#8217; I feel somewhat empowered as an artist to be a part of this big change. I truly believe art can play a profoundly meaningful role in society and be a powerful impact on human life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee has shown her work at numerous venues around the world, including solo exhibitions in Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo, Canberra, Toronto, Montreal, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Berlin. She is the director of the Contemporary Print Media Research Center at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="84fbe2b7807270175cb4ed6b64026bff"><name>update-directory-information</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Request to update directory information</title><summary>The University of California, Santa Cruz, is undertaking efforts to log the work location of all of our employees.

While these detections are relatively common for VERITAS, this black hole is potentially the first known astrophysical source of high-energy cosmic neutrinos, a type of ghostly subatomic particle.</p>
<p>On September 22, 2017, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, a cubic-kilometer neutrino telescope located at the South Pole, detected a high-energy neutrino of potential astrophysical origin. However, the observation of a single neutrino by itself is not enough for IceCube to claim the detection of a source. For that, scientists needed more information.</p>
<p>Very quickly after the detection by IceCube was announced, telescopes around the world including VERITAS (which stands for the &#8220;Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System&#8221;) swung into action to identify the source. The VERITAS, MAGIC, and H.E.S.S. gamma-ray observatories all looked at the neutrino position. In addition, two gamma-ray observatories that monitor much of the sky at lower and higher energies also provided coverage.</p>
<p>These follow-up observations of the rough IceCube neutrino position suggest that the source of the neutrino is a blazar, which is a supermassive black hole with powerful outflowing jets that can change dramatically in brightness over time. This blazar, known as TXS 0506+056, is located at the center of a galaxy about 4 billion light years from Earth.</p>
<p>"We know that the blazar jet is accelerating particles to very high energies, but it is difficult to tell from gamma rays alone if it is accelerating just electrons or also protons and heavier nuclei," said David Williams, adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) and a member of the VERITAS collaboration. "If the blazar is a neutrino source, that's a smoking gun for protons, because high-energy protons colliding with gas produce pions, which decay into neutrinos," he said.</p>
<p>Initially, NASA&#8217;s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observed that TXS 0506+056 was several times brighter than usually seen in its all-sky monitoring. Eventually, the MAGIC observatory made a detection of much higher-energy gamma rays within two weeks of the neutrino detection, while VERITAS, H.E.S.S., and HAWC did not see the blazar in any of their observations during the two weeks following the alert.</p>
<p>Given the importance of higher-energy gamma-ray detections in identifying the possible source of the neutrino, VERITAS continued to observe TXS 0506+056 over the following months, through February 2018, and revealed the source but at a dimmer state than what was detected by MAGIC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The VERITAS detection shows us that the gamma-ray brightness of the source changes, which is a signature of a blazar,&#8221; said Wystan Benbow of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), which operates and manages VERITAS. &#8220;Finding a link between an astrophysical source and a neutrino event could open yet another window of exploration to the extreme universe.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Cosmic rays</strong></p>
<p>The detection of gamma rays coincident with neutrinos is tantalizing, since both particles must be produced in the generation of cosmic rays. Since they were first detected over 100 years ago, cosmic rays&#8212;highly energetic particles that continuously rain down on Earth from space&#8212;have posed an enduring mystery. What creates and launches these particles across such vast distances? Where do they come from?</p>
<p>&#8220;The potential connection between the neutrino event and TXS 0506+056 would shed new light on the acceleration mechanisms that take place at the core of these galaxies and provide clues on the century-old question of the origin of cosmic rays,&#8221; said coauthor and VERITAS spokesperson Reshmi Mukherjee of Barnard College, Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;Astrophysics is entering an exciting new era of multi-messenger observations, in which celestial sources are being studied through the detection of the electromagnetic radiation they emit across the spectrum, from radio waves to high-energy gamma rays, in combination with non-electromagnetic means, such as gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos,&#8221; said coauthor Marcos Santander of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, who led the study.</p>
<p>A paper describing the deep VERITAS observations of TXS 0506+056 (&#8220;VERITAS Observations of the BL Lac Object TXS 0506+056&#8221;) has been accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and appears online on July 12, 2018. A paper on the IceCube and initial gamma-ray observations, including VERITAS&#8217;s, appears in the latest issue of the journal <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>"This is a terrific step forward in multi-messenger astrophysics," said Williams, who worked on the analysis of the VERITAS data and coordinated the VERITAS contributions to the <em>Science</em> paper.</p>
<p>VERITAS is a ground-based facility located at the SAO&#8217;s Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in southern Arizona. It consists of an array of four 12-meter optical telescopes that can detect gamma rays via the extremely brief flashes of blue &#8220;Cherenkov&#8221; light created when gamma rays are absorbed in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. The VERITAS Collaboration consists of about 80 scientists from 20 institutions in the United States, Canada, Germany and Ireland.</p>
<p>The Fermi-LAT Collaboration, which also played an important role in this research, includes researchers at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.wisc.edu/cosmic-rays/</url><title>Solving the Mystery of Cosmic Rays</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-fermi-traces-source-of-cosmic-neutrino-to-monster-black-hole</url><title>NASAâ€™s Fermi Traces Source of Cosmic Neutrino to Monster Black Hole</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.desy.de/e428/e548/e4802/e274718/e274917/index_eng.html</url><title>Breakthrough in the search for cosmic particle accelerators</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.science360.gov/archives/20180713</url><title>NSF Video: Multi-messenger astrophysics neutrino breakthrough</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8a22a7f6807270175cb4ed6b975ec35c"><name>kletzer-dean</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Growing graduate programs to meet the needs of today's students</title><summary>Lori Kletzer enjoys leadership challenges that involve collaboration and strategic thinking, two skills that will come into play in her new role as vice provost and dean of the Division of Graduate Studies.</summary><keywords>kletzer, dean, graduate education, economics, uc santa cruz</keywords><start-date>1531321200000</start-date><display-name>Kletzer-Dean</display-name><path>/2018/07/kletzer-dean</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/kletzer-dean</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1531325883287</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531339092954</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/kletzer-dean-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/kletzer-dean-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kletzer-dean-375.jpg</name><display-name>kletzer-dean-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>42933</file-size><width>375</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Lori Kletzer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/kletzer-dean-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/kletzer-dean-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kletzer-dean-80.jpg</name><display-name>kletzer-dean-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8627</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Lori Kletzer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>"Across the country today, more than 50 percent of all college and university faculty positions are nontenured," said incoming Vice Provost and Dean of the Graduate Division Lori Kletzer.

<p>"My charge is to strengthen and grow graduate programs," said Kletzer. "My role will be to work side by side with the academic departments to help them grow their current programs and think about new programs they want to develop."</p>
<p>Kletzer, a professor of economics who joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1992, is stepping into this key leadership position following seven years as provost of Colby College. Returning to campus, she is eager to lead the "centrally important task" of graduate education.</p>
<p>Kletzer, a labor economist who specializes in the labor market consequences of international trade and technological change, says this opportunity is a good fit for "my history and UC Santa Cruz's history." The Graduate Division is better integrated into the campus than ever before, and growth will enhance the UC Santa Cruz mission of teaching and research, boost the campus's reputation, and prepare graduates to assume leadership opportunities in the 21st century economy.</p>
<p>"When I arrived in 1992, UC Santa Cruz was very much an undergraduate campus, even though we had graduate programs," said Kletzer. "We had a really strong reputation&#8212;deservedly&#8212;as an undergraduate institution. Over the last 26 years, we have embraced the value of graduate programs."</p>
<p>Strong graduate programs enhance undergraduate education in multiple ways, said Kletzer, who sees them as complementary rather than competing interests.</p>
<p>"Our doctoral students and postdoctoral scholars enhance the teaching environment, they help provide research mentorship to undergraduates, and they are role models for our undergraduates," she said. "They enrich the research environment and raise our research reputation, which attracts undergraduates and enhances the value of their degree after they graduate. Graduate programs make a direct, positive impact on undergraduates. It's not a trade-off."</p>
<p><strong>Commitment to growth</strong></p>
<p>The campus currently faces a mandate to grow its doctoral program enrollment to 12 percent of undergraduate enrollment&#8212;a goal linked to "rebenching," the UC Office of the President initiative to redress past inequities in per-student state funding at some UC campuses that also provided funds to UC Santa Cruz to increase doctoral enrollments. Calling that target a "really steep path to climb" from current enrollment levels of just under 8 percent, Kletzer said she is eager to work with faculty in departments and through the Academic Senate to support realistic growth.</p>
<p>"As provost at Colby, many of my academic program accomplishments came about through collaboration," she said, mentioning the launch of an enhanced major in computational biology that involved the computer science and biology departments, together with the establishment of a partnership with a research laboratory located in Maine.</p>
<p>"As provost, I wasn't going to tell my faculty how to design the curriculum. I know my colleagues bring the intellectual firepower," she said. "But academic departments won't launch programs without a commitment from the center."</p>
<p>That commitment can take the form of additional faculty resources, expanded fellowships, support for teaching assistants and graduate student research assistance, and market research, noted Kletzer, adding, "Each side knows what the other can bring. We are stronger together."</p>
<p>Kletzer credits her predecessor, Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies Tyrus Miller, with bringing the division "out from the shadows."</p>
<p>"The division is much more integrated with the academic divisions, and it's much more visible to the departments and central campus than it was five years ago," she said. "Tyrus thought hard about how to use resources, and the division is much stronger for his leadership."</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp are &#8220;fully committed&#8221; to the importance of growing doctoral education and they are "mindful of what any campus initiative means for graduate programs," noted Kletzer.</p>
<p>Masters program enrollments, which Kletzer said make a "serious contribution to California's workforce needs," are in good shape, having grown 14 percent during the past five years. "Increasingly, undergraduates think about getting an advanced degree, and master's degrees are the most common," she said.</p>
<p><strong>A changing landscape</strong></p>
<p>Doctoral education, however, is a changing and challenging landscape. Once exclusively dedicated to producing tenure-track faculty, doctoral programs today need to prepare graduates for a range of nonacademic jobs, said Kletzer.</p>
<p>"Across the country today, more than 50 percent of all college and university faculty positions are nontenured," said Kletzer. "That's really different than when I went to graduate school 38 years ago. This has been changing over the last 20 years&#8212;first in humanities, but it has changed now across the disciplines. We need to be willing to see it for what it is and broaden our view of labor-market outcomes for our graduates."</p>
<p>To adapt, graduate programs may need to rethink their curriculum, their advising and mentoring efforts, and their expectations about how long it takes to earn a doctorate, said Kletzer.</p>
<p>"The future of graduate education, especially at the doctoral level, is going to lead to many more nonacademic careers," she said, which means it will be important to increase support for nonacademic jobs.</p>
<p>"I want to work with faculty so they recognize the validity of diverse career paths," she said. "I worry that we prioritize tenure-track academic jobs and there's some stigma attached to nonacademic jobs. The skills and training we provide doctoral students can be used broadly across the labor market."</p>
<p>Kletzer is eager to bring diverse voices to the table, to learn what other institutions are doing, and to get her hands on national data about where Ph.D. holders are getting jobs. "Those data are decentralized, so it's tough to understand the landscape," she said. "As a labor economist, it's an incredibly interesting problem."</p>
<p>Which brings Kletzer back to the appeal of her new job.</p>
<p>"I took on the Colby provostship because it was an attractive leadership opportunity," she said. "I wanted to strengthen academic programs, build teaching and research partnerships, and support faculty. With those goals met, I was eager to get back to our more research-intensive environment and make a contribution here. Building our graduate programs requires leadership and collaboration. That's a combination that really suits me."</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Researchers have calculated the capacity of North American forests to sequester carbon in a detailed analysis that for the first time integrates the effects of two key factors: the natural process of forest growth and regeneration, and climate changes that are likely to alter the growth process over the next 60 years.</p>
<p>The result is a compelling picture that's of great value, because forests play a critical role in mitigating the effects of climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, storing the carbon in their wood.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of hope that our forests will soak up the carbon dioxide we're producing, but the capacity of our forests is limited," said lead researcher Kai Zhu, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Zhu's team found that North American forests have reached 78 percent of their capacity to sequester carbon and will gain only 22 percent capacity&#8212;at most&#8212;over the next 60 years. That's a cautionary finding that has implications for forest managers, climate scientists, and policy makers.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>A better methodology</strong></p>
<p>Unlike previous attempts to quantify forests' capacity to sequester carbon, which relied on simulation models or satellite data, Zhu's findings are based on exhaustive, ground-based measurements of forests across the continental United States and Canada.</p>
<p>He analyzed data from 140,000 plots in the <a href="https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/">U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis program</a> and the Canada Permanent Sample Plots program to document the historical growth of forests and project their growth into the future. But he knew he couldn't produce an accurate forecast without also accounting for climate change.</p>
<p>"To do a good job predicting the future, we have to consider both factors&#8212;natural recovery and climate change that modifies growth&#8212;because both are important biologically," he said.</p>
<p>Zhu's predictions are based on a complex growth model that incorporates contemporary data from 2000-2016 and "hindcast" observations from 1990-1999. He then used the model to predict forest conditions under climate change scenarios in the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, before quantifying the extent to which current forest biomass approaches future biomass potential.</p>
<p>"We found that climate change effectively modifies the forest recovery trajectory, but the bigger factor is that overall forest growth is limited," said Zhu.</p>
<p><strong>A best-case scenario</strong></p>
<p>Zhu's findings represent the "best-case scenario," because they reflect idealized assumptions based on past forest performance and climate-change projections from the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>.</p>
<p>"The assumption was that existing forests will happily grow without future disturbances, but in reality, there will likely be disturbances," explained Zhu.</p>
<p>Such disturbances could include disease outbreaks, and wildfire and wind effects, as well as human-caused effects such as the loss of forests to development. Every time disturbances occur, it will reduce forest biomass, so the actual forest capacity is likely to be lower than the best-case scenario from this analysis.</p>
<p>"This is the first time wall-to-wall, ground-based data across North America was used," said Zhu. "We haven't had detailed knowledge about this carbon sink until now, so this is a starting point to think about the future."</p>
<p>The findings point to the need to protect North American forests and reduce deforestation elsewhere, said Zhu. "Reducing deforestation in the tropics is much easier than expanding forests in North America," he added. "That option is very limited."</p>
<p><strong>Forest recovery over the centuries</strong></p>
<p>For Zhu, the past offered clues to the future. The backdrop of his work is based on the dramatic recovery of North American forests since the early 20th century following the removal of huge swaths to make way for agriculture, especially in the Northeastern United States. Better soils in the Midwest led to the abandonment of much of that cleared land, setting the stage for the recovery of forests.</p>
<p>"Forests in the Northeast have recovered in a pretty dramatic way: During the 18th and 19th centuries, more than half the forestland was cleared, but during the 20th century, forests returned. Today about 80 percent of the Northeast is forested," he said, also noting the high value of the big trees of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Today, however, North American forests are getting close to the saturation point as older trees plateau; future growth is primarily limited to the pine forests of the East and Southeast. "The future potential is pretty limited," said Zhu. "If mitigation depends on forests, this has implications for conservation that we have to think about."</p>
<p>Zhu's paper, "Limits to Growth of Forest Biomass Carbon Sink Under Climate Change," appears in the current issue of <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>. The title, Zhu notes, alludes to <em>The Limits to Growth</em>, a breakthrough 1972 book about the interactions of human population, industrialization, food production, natural resources, and pollution.</p>

<p>Faced with the largest applicant pool in campus history&#8212;67,000 applications&#8212;and a smaller enrollment target than the previous year, UC Santa Cruz increased its admission selectivity, based on <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/content-analysis/ug-admissions/ug-pages/2018-admissions.html">numbers released today</a> (July 11) by the UC Office of the President. This year&#8217;s admitted freshmen had an average GPA of 3.93, average (new) SAT scores of 1322, and an average ACT of 28.</p>
<p>&#8220;Santa Cruz offers a distinctive UC education within its 10 residential colleges, where students prepare for the future with foci on critical thinking, social justice, technology, the arts, sciences, and most importantly, learning how to make a difference through study, innovation, and teamwork across differences,&#8221; said Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey. &#8220;It is always exciting to see the expanding interest in our campus, though unfortunate that we are not able to accommodate all students wishing to join our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, California&#8217;s high schoolers received the majority of offers with more than 18,000 gaining acceptance to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Total freshmen admission offers declined slightly (by 0.8 percent), reflecting both an exceptionally large entering class back in fall 2016 and smaller enrollment targets for fall 2018.</p>
<p>With a steep rise in the number of transfer applications, UC Santa Cruz increased admissions offers to California community college students, offering a spot to 7,072 students, a 31 percent increase from last year and a 37 percent increase from 2016.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz anticipates welcoming about 5,600 new undergraduates who have selected the campus for its exceptional commitment to social justice, track record for high-impact research, supportive student resource centers, and opportunities to work with faculty members on research projects and performances.</p>
<p>The campus expects to enroll approximately 3,700 new freshmen, about 5 out of 6 students from California, and the remainder coming from other states or countries.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are preparing to welcome the new class into UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s distinctive residential colleges, Summer Academies, Scholars Program, and new federally funded programs related to the campus&#8217;s Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) status, and ever-expanding opportunities for undergraduate research, internships, and creative projects with world-class faculty.</p>
<p>&#8220;A focus of the entire campus this year was to grow the portion of entering California transfer students in response to a state legislative mandate to shift the portion of students entering UC and each campus from the transfer pathway rather than directly from high school ,&#8221; said Hughey. &#8220;The work, in partnership with the California Community Colleges and the UC Office of the President has been exceptionally successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz expects to enroll 1,900 new transfer students in fall, 50 percent more than last year. Overall, the campus expects to enroll about 200 more California students than last year, with a reduction in California freshman and an increase in California transfer students.</p>
<p>Campus diversity remains strong with the percentage of admitted African American, American Indian, Asian American, and Chicano/Latino students remaining steady.</p>
<p>The campus admitted 774 African American students from California high schools, accounting for 4.1 percent of all California frosh admits, about the same as last year. The campus remains committed to reaching a critical mass of African American undergraduates in order to create a more inclusive environment. The near-term goal is to increase from the current 4.2 percent of overall undergraduate enrollments to 5 percent. Students, staff, faculty, and alumni continue to collaborate on ways to enhance the campus climate.</p>
<p>Recruiting students from other countries and states remains a campus goal, both to maintain an inclusive campus and to bring more perspectives that can contribute to a dynamic social and cultural atmosphere. The campus offered admission to 2,957 out-of-state students and 5,288 international freshmen. The campus anticipates having about 700 new freshman and transfer students from other states or countries enroll this fall. Students from other states and countries comprise about 10 percent of the undergraduate class.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b3ac8f6807270175cb4ed6b17f7ae13"><name>new-vice-provost-dean-of-academic-studies</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New vice provost and dean of graduate studies</title><summary>I am delighted to announce that Lori Kletzer has been selected as UC Santa Cruzâ€™s new vice provost and dean of graduate studies, effective Aug. 1.</summary><start-date>1531342800000</start-date><display-name>New vice provost and dean of graduate studies</display-name><path>/2018/07/new-vice-provost-dean-of-academic-studies</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/new-vice-provost-dean-of-academic-studies</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1531344242894</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531344436212</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am delighted to announce that&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/kletzer-dean.html">Lori Kletzer has been selected as UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s new vice provost and dean of graduate studies</a>, effective Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Lori first joined UC Santa Cruz in 1992 as an assistant professor of economics. She received her Ph.D. in economics from UC Berkeley and her bachelor's degree from Vassar College. Working her way through the ranks at UCSC, Lori served as economics department chair, then vice chair and chair of the Academic Senate. In 2010, she became provost and dean of faculty at Colby College. She left that position in June 2017.</p>
<p>Lori has held teaching and research appointments at Williams College, the University of Washington, the Brookings Institution, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Her research focuses on the domestic labor market effects of globalization and policy responses. She is the author of two books and numerous articles on the impact of international trade in manufacturing on employment, jobs, job displacement, and earnings.</p>
<p>Lori brings to the position deep experience with UC Santa Cruz, with shared governance, and with administrative leadership. She has clear-eyed objectives for graduate studies and graduate-student support, and will be a strong advocate for the division. Both Chancellor Blumenthal and I look forward to working closely with her.</p>
<p>We were fortunate to have an extremely impressive field of internal candidates for the position, which speaks to the strength of our faculty roster and our leadership across the university. I would like to thank all the candidates for their engagement throughout the process.</p>
<p>I also would like to thank the members of the&#160;<a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/leadership-searches/vpd-gs/vp-gs-search-committee.html">search committee</a>, which was overseen by Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee.</p>

<p>It is internationally recognized as the premier center for Dickens studies in the world and one of the leading sites for research on 19th-century British culture.<br/><br/>Each summer, the Dickens Universe program brings together scholars, teachers, students, and members of the general public for a week of intense study and festivities, usually focused on a novel by Charles Dickens.<br/><br/>2018 marks the 38th year of the annual gathering at UC Santa Cruz, and the event&#8212;which takes place the week of July 15-21&#8212;is nearly sold out. <br/><br/>But fear not. A special feature of this year's program is a free day&#8212;Tuesday, July 17&#8212;when the conference will be open without charge to members of the local community. Included among the many attractions will be the opportunity to experience a Victorian tea, as well as a<em> <a href="https://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/spirit-photographer.html"><strong>presentation by UC Santa Cruz alumnus</strong></a></em> Jon Michael Varese (Ph.D. Literature, 2011), discussing his newly published debut novel, <em>The Spirit Photographer</em>.<br/><br/>Inspired by the spirit photography craze that swept the country during and after the Civil War, Varese&#8217;s novel explores post-Civil War America&#8217;s various challenges with regard to loss, slavery, hypocrisy, and racial injustice. Varese will be joined in conversation by Victorian photography scholar Daniel Novak, and a book signing will follow the event.<br/><br/>&#8220;Jon Varese is a long-time participant in the Dickens Project, beginning in 1997 when he first entered the Ph.D. program in literature at UCSC,&#8221; noted John Jordan, director and co-founder of the Dickens Project. &#8220;He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the serial publication of Victorian fiction, focusing on novels by Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and George Eliot. While finishing his dissertation, he worked as a technical writer in Silicon Valley and helped develop and maintain the Dickens Project website.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;Having previously been the winner of a&#160;scholarship essay contest for high school students, he developed the idea to establish a similar scholarship program for the Dickens Project and helped raise money to get it off the ground,&#8221; Jordan added. &#8220;Eventually this program transformed into an ongoing relationship between the Project and a South Los Angeles high school that sends college-bound students from low income communities and their teachers every year to the annual Dickens Universe conference.&#8221;<br/><br/>Now employed full time in the high tech industry, Varese currently serves as the director of outreach for the Dickens Project. He has also continued his work as a literary scholar, focusing on Dickens. Varese edited and wrote the introduction for an edition of <em>Great Expectations</em>, and recently contributed a chapter on Nicholas Nickleby to the prestigious <em>Oxford Handbook of Charles Dickens</em>, which will be published in September. <br/><br/>&#8220;<em>The Spirit Photographer</em> combines many of Jon's interests,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;An historical novel set in the 19th century, it showcases Jon's close familiarity with 19th century history and culture, including the history of photography and the legacy of slavery in post-Civil War America. The novel also reflects Jon's long immersion in Victorian literature. Its plot plays with themes and motifs familiar to readers of Dickens--ghosts, family secrets, and the return of repressed memories from the past. Like <em>Little Dorrit</em>, the featured novel at this year's Dickens Universe, it presents a powerful blend of realism and scenes of uncanny hallucination.&#8221; <br/><br/><strong>Another special event</strong> at this year's Universe will be an opportunity for participants&#8212;including members of the general public--to do original research on Dickens. Jordan noted that representatives of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, where the manuscripts of Dickens's novels are housed, will screen pages from those manuscripts.<br/><br/>&#8220;Universe attendees will help to decipher Dickens's often crabbed and difficult handwriting, contributing eventually to a complete annotated transcription of those documents,&#8221; said Jordan. "'Deciphering Dickens,' as this event is called, will be led by Professor John Bowen of the University of York and Douglas Dodds, a Senior Curator at the V&amp;A.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8f6646fe807270175cb4ed6bbde67a3d"><name>stephanie-allain-champions-diversity</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna and film producer Stephanie Allain champions diversity</title><summary>Stephanie Allain is a rare gem in the film industry.

Not only is she brilliant and successful, but as an African-American woman who got her start over 25 years ago in a notoriously and overwhelmingly white and male-dominated business, she has charged ahead to break open established perceptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been involved in diversifying Hollywood since before it was hip,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And we are finally starting to see real change. There was a time when you&#8217;d see names on a directors&#8217; list and there would only be white guys on it and no one would even blink. That time is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an independent film producer, Allain has her own production company and has served as the director of the LA Film Festival, transforming it into the most diverse film festival in the world. She&#8217;s also a board member of Women in Film, a founding member of ReFrame, and is a member of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, Writers Guild of America, Producers Guild of America, and the Dramatists Guild of America.</p>
<p>Spending her childhood in both New Orleans, where she was born and visited every summer, and in Los Angeles, where she was raised and attended school, gave her a unique perspective on various cultures. Allain attended St. Mary&#8217;s Academy, a college prep high school in Inglewood where she excelled in literature and creative writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no idea about the film business and how it worked, or what a producer or a studio executive did,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But I did love movies and books, so often I&#8217;d read a book and then go see the movie, and intuitively try to understand the connections between the page and the screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it came time to think about college, staying in LA and attending the University of Southern California (USC) seemed like the best choice. But after a couple of years, she got restless, left school, travelled to Hawaii, then moved to Madrid, all the while trying to find a place where she really belonged and could grow.</p>
<p>She found herself searching for just the right place to continue her education and, after a lot of research, decided that UC Santa Cruz was it. She applied to the creative writing program and started her new life. &#8220;I was a junior by then and immediately found my tribe. I also started daily dance classes in the Theater Department and made friends with Zeke Richardson who ran a KZSC radio show called&#160;<em>Rebels Without Applause</em>.&#8221;&#160;&#160;In fact, one of the Rebels&#8217; actors, Mitch Marcus, became her first husband and the father of her two sons. She&#8217;s still close with many of the friends she made at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz was a great, nurturing ground for training in the arts and finding my people.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Torn between academia and the arts</h3>
<p>While still at UCSC, Allain continued to study dance and writing and was encouraged by her dance teacher, Donald Byrd, to apply to CalArts for grad school to continue her dance studies. She found herself torn between academia and the arts.</p>
<p>CalArts won out but not before she realized that, even though she loved studying dance, she wasn&#8217;t ready to commit to the unpredictable life of a dancer. &#8220;I wanted to make money, and have a family so I moved to San Francisco with one of my fellow UCSC graduates and started working at Ballet Magazine,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I was still dancing and writing, and just living my best life.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then an unexpected development changed her path yet again. &#8220;My boyfriend, Mitch (also a UCSC graduate) and I ended up making a baby!&#8221; Being only 23 at the time, she knew that her entire life was about to take a dramatic turn. &#8220;I decided to move back home and try to figure out how I was going to support myself and this new baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allain started to really reflect on what she was good at and what she liked to do. Being naturally analytical, she carefully weighed her abilities and passions and heard about a job in the entertainment industry called a &#8220;reader&#8221;, thinking that getting paid to read would be the perfect career choice for her. And she persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just went from one person that someone knew, who led me to another person&#8230;I worked for free&#8230;I worked for $25 a script...eventually I landed a job at Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which was the biggest talent agency in town, and worked in the story department as a reader, reading books and scripts. Through that job, I found out about another job at the studios called &#8216;story analyst&#8217;, and that it paid really well.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Making connections that would change her life</h3>
<p>From there, Allain landed a position as a story analyst at 20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox, making fortuitous connections that would propel her rise within the industry. One of those key contacts was VP Amy Pascal who was so impressed with Allain&#8217;s writing, that she asked her to be her personal reader. When Pascal moved over to Columbia Pictures, Allain joined her there and ultimately was promoted from the story department to join the executive ranks.</p>
<p>In the process of becoming a creative executive, she also needed to find a replacement for her former position and was determined to find a person of color to fulfill that role. One of the applicants was a senior at USC School of Cinematic Arts who seemed much more interested in talking to her about his screenplay than interviewing for the job.</p>
<p>His name was John Singleton and his screenplay, entitled&#160;<em>Boyz N the Hood</em>, centered around three African-American male friends growing up in South Central LA with violence and crime enmeshed in their everyday lives. Singleton&#8217;s story was not the kind of subject matter that Hollywood typically embraced, especially in 1990, but Allain zeroed in on its brilliance and importance. She was determined to not only get it made but to have Singleton direct.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Boyz N the&#160;Hood</em> set the tone for my career,&#8221; says Allain. The film was also her debut as a production executive, requiring her to learn the intricacies of making a movie from the ground up. All of her hard work and dedication definitely paid off.</p>
<p>Starring Cuba Gooding, Jr., Ice Cube, and Laurence Fishburne,&#160;<em>Boyz N the&#160;Hood</em>&#160;garnered Academy Award nominations of Best Original Screenplay and Best Director for Singleton, who was only 24 years old at the time and was the youngest person ever nominated for Best Director, and the very first African-American to be nominated in that category. This landmark film was selected to be preserved in the National Film Registry for its cultural significance - a rare and distinguished honor - only 25 films are chosen each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Boyz N the&#160;Hood</em>&#160;made such a splash! It debuted at Cannes and had a 20-minute standing ovation&#8230; Academy Award nominations&#8230;.&#8221; says Allain. &#8220;With that film, I really carved out a space for myself at Columbia, where I stayed for ten years, championing brown, black, and female-centered movies. Working with John Singleton really taught me to protect artists and their vision from unnecessary studio interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allain continued to supervise several successful projects including Singleton&#8217;s&#160;<em>Poetic Justice</em>. &#8220;I found [director/writer] Robert Rodriguez and brought him into the studio and we made&#160;<em>El&#160;Mariachi</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Desperado</em>. I supervised&#160;<em>I&#160;Like It Like&#160;That</em>&#160;directed [and written] by Darnell Martin, a black, Puerto Rican director. It was very fulfilling and I was happy to open the door for my people, but I did feel the squeeze between the studio and the artist.&#8221;</p>
<p>She started to rethink where she wanted to go. It had been ten years since she had her first child, and another baby was on the way. It was time for a change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked for another job and I didn&#8217;t have to look far because the studio made a deal with Jim Henson Pictures and they asked me to run it.&#8221; Thinking that Henson would allow her to bring together her professional and personal life by making family movies, Allain eagerly took the job.</p>
<h3>Turning disaster into success</h3>
<p>But it turned out to be a disaster. &#8220;I made terrible movies and was fired,&#8221; she says. &#8220;And it forced me to assess what I wanted and who I was. I&#8217;d been working in a corporation at this point for nearly 15 years and got used to making a big salary and having all of the trappings associated with that which are very, very real. &#8220;Basically, I woke up one morning and said &#8216;I don&#8217;t want it anymore. I don&#8217;t want any of it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She took time off to reconnect with her two sons, one of whom was a budding performer. 3 Arts approached her to be their in-house producer and she took the job wary that management wasn&#8217;t really her thing.</p>
<p>While there she came across a stirring and thoughtful script by a young, relatively inexperienced writer/director named Craig Brewer, called&#160;<em>Hustle&#160;&amp;&#160;Flow</em>&#160;and knew the film deserved to be made. Not only did it have a black cast, but it flipped the glorified stereotype of a pimp, showing that even the lowest of the low could be elevated through artistic expression &#8211; specifically music.</p>
<p>Her passion for the project pushed her to take the plunge and sell practically everything she owned, including her house, in order to make it happen. &#8220;Hollywood 101 &#8211;&#160;<em>never</em>&#160;put your own money into movies, but I was really desperate for meaning and for artistic expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also called her friend John Singleton to tell him about the project and he ended up financing the entire film. Yet again, Allain recognized the potential of an outstanding screenplay and turned it into an outstanding film. Together she and Singleton produced the film and Brewer directed it.</p>
<h3>Academy Award firsts</h3>
<p><em>Hustle &amp;&#160;Flow</em>&#160;was not only a huge commercial success but its lead actor, Terrence Howard, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and the film&#8217;s song,&#160;It&#8217;s Hard Out Here for a&#160;Pimp&#160;by Cedric Coleman and Three 6 Mafia, won an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Three 6 Mafia was the first hip-hop group to ever perform at the Oscars and win the Oscar in that category.</p>
<p>Allain founded&#160;<strong>Homegrown&#160;Pictures</strong>&#160;in 2003, and never looked back. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been producing independently for the last 15 years and I&#8217;ve been an artist riding the ups and downs of being hot, being not, of hit movies, of movies no one saw&#8230;and crafting a life of diverse content creation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allain views the onslaught of digital formats as a means for up and coming filmmakers to get their work out in the world without needing to seek permission via big studios. She&#8217;s at a stage in her life where she&#8217;s seeing the people that she mentored start to mentor the next generation, and she&#8217;s excited about platforms such as Netflix and Amazon that are making it easier for all kinds of content to get produced.</p>
<h3>"We're a company of all-black females..."</h3>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting to be open to new advancements and to not hold on too hard to how it was,&#8221; she observes. &#8220;My company, Homegrown Pictures, is now in TV, film, and digital platforms. We&#8217;re a company of all-black females pushing out content that humanizes people of color, and other under-represented folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Homegrown Pictures produced&#160;<em>Something New</em>,&#160;<em>Black Snake Moan</em>,&#160;<em>Hurricane Season</em>,&#160;<em>Beyond the Lights</em>,&#160;<em>Peeples</em>,&#160;<em>Dear White People</em>, <em>Burning Sands</em>, <em>French Dirty</em>&#160;and more.</p>
<p>Allain stresses the power of representation and how important it is to have shows like&#160;<em>Dear White&#160;People</em>&#160;on the air. &#8220;I just produced a film with Alfre Woodard called&#160;<em>Juanita&#160;</em>(Netflix), and when I showed it to my mom and her friends, my mom started crying. She saw in that character someone like herself and felt represented on the screen&#8230;a middle-aged black woman as the main character.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allain has always appreciated how other women in the business opened doors for her and in turn she&#8217;s done the same for women trying to break in. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a myth that women are separatists and only looking out for themselves. My experience has been quite the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<h3>"Distinguish yourself by your work and your passion..."</h3>
<p>Allain admits that what she does is hard work and can be a hustle&#8230;up one day and down the next. But because she absolutely loves what she does, it&#8217;s a risk worth taking, and she feels blessed that she can be creative every day, reading stories, going to casting meetings, sitting with directors and choosing projects she&#8217;s enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>For students who want to follow in her footsteps, she emphasizes how important it is for them to really understand who they are and what excites them, and then to immerse themselves in whatever that is and become an expert in it. &#8220;So many people&#160;<em>talk</em> about doing the work, but they don&#8217;t actually&#160;<em>do</em>&#160;the work. If you can distinguish yourself by your work and your passion, then you&#8217;re going to be ahead of the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also key to commit yourself to being in it for the long haul because in Hollywood, you&#8217;re only as good as the last thing you made. &#8220;It&#8217;s a marathon! Have a long eye towards the ups and downs, hits and disasters, and, as my mother always told me&#8230;your assistant today could be your boss tomorrow&#8230;so rule number one is to always be nice!&#8221;</p>
<p>Allain attributes her early success to being willing to work hard &#8211; to take scripts home with her on the weekends and read through a stack so that she was fully prepared on Monday to discuss them. She also read everything else she could get her hands on, from newspapers to novels, to get an informed look at the world and give her a wider context for her work.</p>
<p>In spite of all of the hard work, she also appreciates having a personal life and realizes how that has contributed to her overall success. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important because it gives you a well of emotion and experience to draw from. Having kids in this business has been invaluable to me just as a human being.</p>
<p>On May 1, 2018, Allain returned to the UCSC campus as one of the key speakers during the&#160;<strong><a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/lectures/dean-lecture-series-2018">Arts Dean&#8217;s Lecture Series on Creative Entrepreneurship</a></strong>&#160;developed by&#160;<strong>Dean Susan Solt</strong>. The series featured a distinguished roster of arts practitioners, creative, educators, and advocates who provided illuminating insights, practical tools, and personal stories on how to shape an artistic or arts-related career in the 21st century. Allain&#8217;s inspiring talk, entitled&#160;From Employee to Employer, gave students a valuable insider&#8217;s look into what it takes to start out&#160;in the professional world and turn your dream job&#160;into a gratifying, lifelong career.</p>
<p>Allain looks forward to seeing what the next generation of students will bring. &#8220;I just hope that UCSC keeps turning out talented artists to send to Hollywood who will change the world for the better!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8f9460e5807270175cb4ed6bd649f927"><name>river-blindness</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Basic research in fruit flies leads to potential drug for diseases afflicting millions</title><summary>A promising drug to treat river blindness and other neglected tropical diseases caused by filarial worms is now in preclinical development.</summary><keywords>William Sullivan, Wolbachia</keywords><start-date>1531378800000</start-date><display-name>Basic research in fruit flies leads to potential drug for diseases afflicting millions</display-name><path>/2018/07/river-blindness</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/river-blindness</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1531417222289</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531515435360</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/filarial-nematode-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/filarial-nematode-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>filarial-nematode-410.jpg</name><display-name>filarial-nematode-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>42973</file-size><width>410</width><height>205</height></image><image-alt>filarial nematode cells infected with Wolbachia</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/wolbachia-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/wolbachia-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>wolbachia-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>wolbachia-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20703</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>heartworm cells infected with Wolbachia</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Filarial nematodes, parasitic worms that cause river blindness and elephantiasis, are dependent on <em>Wolbachia</em> bacteria that infect the cells of the worms and are responsible for much of the pathology of those diseases.

They are among the "neglected tropical diseases" for which better treatments are desperately needed. But they were far from the mind of cell biologist William Sullivan when he began studying the microbial parasite <em>Wolbachia,</em> best known for its extraordinary effects on the many insect species it infects.</p>
<p>Sullivan, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz, has spent much of his career studying the basic biology of the cell cycle in the fruit fly <em>Drosophila</em>. To study the interactions of <em>Wolbachia</em> with its insect hosts, he created a stable cell line of <em>Wolbachia</em>-infected <em>Drosophila</em> cells which he could grow indefinitely in the laboratory. This cell line turned out to be an invaluable tool for researchers seeking new drugs to treat river blindness and related diseases.</p>
<p>That's because the filarial nematodes that cause these diseases are actually dependent on <em>Wolbachia</em> living within their cells. Kill the <em>Wolbachia</em>, and the worms die.</p>
<p>"The insects would rather not have the <em>Wolbachia</em> infection--it manipulates their reproductive biology and does all these things to promote its own survival. But the worms can't live without it," Sullivan said.</p>
<p><strong>Screening assay</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan's lab worked with the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://cscenter.pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Chemical Screening Center</a> to develop an automated screening assay that could be used to test thousands of compounds for the ability to kill <em>Wolbachia</em> without harming the <em>Drosophila</em> host cells. Sullivan's team screened nearly 5,000 compounds, of which 40 were active against <em>Wolbachia</em>, including several related to a compound (albendazole) already used to treat filarial nematode infections. Their findings, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002922">published in 2012</a>, showed that albendazole and its metabolites target both the worms and the <em>Wolbachia</em>.</p>
<p>Albendazole and other existing treatments all have shortcomings, however, and Sullivan soon realized that he did not have the funding or the resources to pursue the search for better treatments any further. "At that point, we were stuck, because we didn't have the resources for a full-scale drug discovery effort," he said.</p>
<p>Then he found out about the California Institute for Biomedical Research (<a href="https://calibr.org/">Calibr</a>), a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing medicines for unmet medical needs. With funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Calibr works with external partners, including academic researchers, and provides drug discovery expertise and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Sullivan ended up giving a seminar on his <em>Wolbachia</em> work at Calibr's facilities in La Jolla, which led to an ongoing collaboration. One of his graduate students, Pamela White, worked with Calibr scientists to train them on the screening assay. Ultimately, Calibr tested more than 300,000 compounds with an optimized version of the assay for high-throughput screening.</p>
<p>Sullivan's lab also helped develop a secondary assay for assessing the effectiveness of promising compounds against <em>Wolbachia</em> in filarial nematodes. That was important because the <em>Wolbachia</em> species that infect <em>Drosophila</em> are significantly different from those that infect the worms. "The cell-based assay is not a perfect assay, but it gives you a starting point," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Lead compound</strong></p>
<p>Using Sullivan's assays, Calibr has identified a lead compound, improved its performance, and tested it in animals infected with filarial worms. The compound is currently in preclinical development, the stage at which scientists assess safety and tolerability in animal models. If all goes well, the next step will be phase I clinical trials in humans.</p>
<p>"It's a good example of why we do basic research. You never know where it will lead," Sullivan said.</p>
<p>He admits that transferring his assays to Calibr felt a little uncomfortable at first. "At the time, I thought of it as my thing. But now that I see what they've done with it, I've realized that our contribution was part of a much larger effort and this handoff happened at the perfect time," Sullivan said.</p>
<p>A drug that targets <em>Wolbachia</em> has several advantages over one that targets the worms directly. Research over the past decade has shown that much of the harm caused by filarial nematode infections results from the immune system's inflammatory response to <em>Wolbachia</em> released by the worms. Eliminating the <em>Wolbachia</em> before the worms die reduces that harmful immune response and leads to a slow death of the worms.</p>
<p>The antibiotic doxycycline has been tested in clinical trials and shown to be an effective treatment for elephantiasis (lymphatic filariasis) when given in daily doses for at least four weeks. But a more potent drug with a shorter course of treatment would be much more practical for use in the developing countries where these diseases are prevalent, Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sullivan has begun teaching a course on neglected tropical diseases at UC Santa Cruz. He said the students are amazed to learn how common these diseases are compared to how much research is done on them. "One in six people on this planet suffer from a disease that most people in this country have never heard of," he said. "It's been really eye-opening, for me and for the students."</p>
<p>Sullivan's lab has also continued to study <em>Wolbachia</em> infections in <em>Drosophila</em>, returning to the project for which the infected cell line was initially created. Using the same automated screening assay used in the drug discovery project, Sullivan's team screened the <em>Drosophila</em> genome to find genes that either suppress or increase the proliferation of <em>Wolbachia</em> in host cells. The study, <a href="http://www.genetics.org/content/205/4/1473">published in 2017</a>, identified several key biological pathways that <em>Wolbachia</em> alters in host cells to maintain infections. The findings may explain why <em>Wolbachia</em> infection makes insects resistant to RNA viruses, a feature that is now being exploited in efforts to combat the spread of Zika, dengue, and other mosquito-transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>"There are so many amazing <em>Wolbachia</em> stories, and we still have a lot to learn about it," Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Postdoctoral researchers Laura Serbus and Frederic Landmann and graduate students Pamela White and Laura Chappell were key contributors to the <em>Wolbachia</em> research in Sullivan's lab. Other contributors include Scott Lokey, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and director of the UCSC Chemical Screening Center; Walter Bray, manager of the Chemical Screening Center; and Alain Debec at the Jacques Monod Institute in Paris.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="946fb06e807270175cb4ed6bca21a791"><name>crime-bulletin-suspicious-person</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Crime Bulletinâ€”suspicious person near Music Center</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department received a report about a man who made unwanted comments to another student near the Music Center at 9:30 a.m. on July 10.</summary><start-date>1531436400000</start-date><display-name>Community Crime Bulletinâ€”suspicious person near Music Center</display-name><path>/2018/07/crime-bulletin-suspicious-person</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/crime-bulletin-suspicious-person</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1531498704881</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531499861712</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department received a report about a&#160;man who made unwanted lewd comments to another student near the Music Center&#160;at 9:30 a.m. on July 10.

<p>The training will focus on emergency response to bomb threats. There will be a simulated flash bomb at 9 a.m. that may be audible in the immediate area, but not elsewhere on campus. The goal is to allow members of different public safety agencies to train together by handling a simulated incident at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Please do not be alarmed by the public safety resources you will see on campus. This is a training exercise, not a real incident.</p>
<p>Due to the magnitude of the drill, and the amount of public safety resources participating, the majority of Kresge College will be restricted from public access.</p>
<p>Areas with restricted access on Wednesday will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kresge Town Hall</li>
<li>Owl's Nest Cafe</li>
<li>R-9 Suites</li>
<li>Recreation Room second floor adjacent to the Triplets</li>
<li>Parking lots 142, 143, 145 (all day), and the West Remote Lot (morning only)</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise requires significant work prior to the drill. The company setting up the drill will be on site Monday and Tuesday preparing the site. Access will be restricted on Monday and Tuesday in the following areas for set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kresge Town Hall</li>
<li>R-9 Suites</li>

The Gilliam Fellowship program recognizes exceptional doctoral students who have the potential to be leaders in their fields and the desire to advance diversity and inclusion in the sciences.</p>
<p>Parico is working with Carrie Partch, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, to study the regulation of the biological clock that drives the body's daily rhythms. In particular, he is investigating the deregulation of circadian rhythms in people with delayed sleep phase disorder, which causes them to be "night owls," falling asleep hours after midnight and having trouble waking in the morning.</p>
<p>Parico, who immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was 10, is the oldest of three boys raised by a single mother. After earning a B.S. in bioengineering at UC San Diego, he put off graduate school and worked in the biotech industry for six years to help put his younger brothers through college. During that time, he was active in outreach programs to elementary schools serving disadvantaged populations. Now he is mentoring a student in one of the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">STEM diversity programs</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I hope to empower students from all walks of life through education, mentorship, and outreach," Parico said, noting that he had benefited from financial aid and research mentorship programs himself. "I feel that I should pay it forward by participating in and even establishing similar programs."</p>
<p>Stefany Rubio is studying breast cancer and the regulation of mammary gland stem cells, working with Lindsay Hinck, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. Her interest in biomedical sciences came from watching her mother's struggle with breast cancer. When Rubio was 12, just four years after her family had immigrated from Mexico, her mother died and she and her sister entered the foster system in California. She lived in seven different homes and attended 14 different K-12 schools, and she says she "loved every classroom."</p>
<p>"I believe my desire to pursue a professorship is rooted in the positive impact of my teachers and mentors in shaping my life," Rubio said. "I am passionate about mentorship, and I intend to focus my energies on foster youth."</p>
<p>As an undergraduate at San Diego State University, Rubio served as a student mentor for the Guardian Scholars program for former foster or homeless youth. At UC Santa Cruz, she is mentoring a student in UCSC's Smith Renaissance program for foster youth, and she is working with Hinck to start a new program to engage local foster youth in summer research opportunities.</p>
<p>"I know that foster kids have what it takes to be STEM professionals, and I intend to devote my career to both cancer research and empowering these kids to succeed," Rubio said.</p>
<p>The Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study program promotes excellence in the life sciences and related fields by supporting Ph.D. students committed to a career in academic research and faculty and training programs dedicated to developing the talents of promising graduate students from underrepresented groups.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.hhmi.org/news/45-gilliam-fellowships-support-students-and-advisers-committed-to-increasing-diversity-science?utm_source=HHMI+News&amp;utm_campaign=77ec27414f-Gilliam_Fellows_2018_07_25&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_8f2808e1d6-77ec27414f-70092401</url><title>HHMI Announcement</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/stefany-carlo-295x120.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/stefany-carlo-295x120.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stefany-carlo-295x120.jpg</name><display-name>stefany-carlo-295x120.jpg</display-name><file-size>14841</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Stefany Rubio and Gian Carlo Parico</thumb-alt><title>Two UCSC graduate students win HHMI Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study</title><description>The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) has awarded prestigious Gilliam Fellowships for Advanced Study to two UC Santa Cruz graduate students, Gian Carlo Parico and Stefany Rubio. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a47ec453807270175cb4ed6b104f43fd"><name>inquiry-magazine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Inquiry' magazine now available online</title><summary>The 2018-19 issue of Inquiry@UC Santa Cruz, the annual research magazine from the UC Santa Cruz Office of Research, is now available online.</summary><start-date>1531724400000</start-date><display-name>'Inquiry' magazine now available online</display-name><path>/2018/07/inquiry-magazine</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/inquiry-magazine</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1531768127368</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531768336868</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Publications</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/inquiry-cover-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/inquiry-cover-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>inquiry-cover-350.jpg</name><display-name>inquiry-cover-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>97761</file-size><width>350</width><height>459</height></image><image-alt>Inquiry cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/inquiry-cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/inquiry-cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>inquiry-cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>inquiry-cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22331</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Inquiry cover</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The 2018-19 issue of <em>Inquiry@UC Santa Cruz</em>, the annual research magazine from the UC Santa Cruz Office of Research, is now available online at <a href="http://inquiry.ucsc.edu/">inquiry.ucsc.edu</a>, offering readers a wide range of stories about research spanning the campus's five divisions: Arts, Humanities, Physical &amp;

<p>In one of only a few studies of its kind, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200743">published July 17 in <em>PLOS ONE</em></a>, scientists measured the effects of rat removal on the tropical <em>Pisonia grandis</em> forest at Palmyra Atoll, which provides critical seabird nesting habitat. Before removal, no seedlings of native <em>Pisonia grandis</em> trees were found in research plots. Immediately after removal of invasive rats, seedlings proliferated and plots had an average of 8 seedlings per square meter. For five native tree species, including <em>Pisonia grandis</em>, fewer than 150 seedlings were counted in the presence of rats, and more than 7700 seedlings were counted five years after rats were removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once rats were gone, changes became immediately apparent. We were so excited to walk into a forest stand of towering <em>Pisonia</em> trees and find a mat of tiny seedlings carpeting the forest floor&#8212;something that hadn&#8217;t been observed at Palmyra in recent decades as far as we know,&#8221; said lead author Coral Wolf of UC Santa Cruz and <a href="https://www.islandconservation.org/">Island Conservation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important habitat</strong></p>
<p>Palmyra&#8217;s tropical rainforest also provides important habitat for a native gecko, insects, crabs, and other rare species. <em>Pisonia grandis</em> forests are reported to be in decline globally.</p>
<p>Prior to removal, invasive rats on Palmyra Atoll devoured native seeds and seedlings, as well as seabird eggs and chicks. Removing the rats allowed seabirds to flourish, and the rebounding native forest provides the birds with important nesting and roosting habitat. When seabirds perch in the trees, they provide nutrients to the soil below through guano droppings. These nutrients are then taken up by native plants and also wash into the ocean, where they dramatically benefit surrounding reefs. Restoring the native forest at Palmyra Atoll thus helps keep coral reefs and thriving fish populations healthy and improves their chances of overcoming changing temperatures and other climate change impacts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sea level rise and changing ocean temperature and chemistry will continue to stress Palmyra&#8217;s ecosystems,&#8221; said Alex Wegmann, Palmyra program director for the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. &#8220;Restoring Palmyra&#8217;s native tropical rainforest allows greater whole-ecosystem resilience to climate change impacts.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Positive effects</strong></p>
<p>Measuring the positive effects on native plant communities like the <em>Pisonia</em> forest at Palmyra Atoll will help bolster the case for island management and invasive species eradication in other places around the globe. An unplanned benefit of the rat removal was the eradication of the Asian tiger mosquito (<em>Aedes albopictus)</em>. This outcome could open new avenues for controlling mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases elsewhere.</p>
<p>Two land crab species were observed for the first time on the atoll&#8217;s islets after rat removal, bringing the number of land crab species at Palmyra to nine. Land crabs are the indigenous engineers of low-lying tropical oceanic island ecosystems, and now Palmyra has one of the world&#8217;s most diverse and best protected land crab communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In an age of well-founded concern about the environment, Palmyra Atoll&#8217;s response to the eradication of introduced rats reminds us of the resilience of intact ecosystems and gives us hope for a better tomorrow,&#8221; Wegmann said.</p>
<p>The team of researchers conducted pre-eradication monitoring of trees at Palmyra Atoll in 2004 and 2007, and repeated the monitoring post-eradication in 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2016. Monitoring included teams of two conducting counts of seedling abundance within 55 strip transects and approximately 50 locally rare tree plots distributed across the atoll.</p>
<p>The 2016 monitoring team of five was led by biologist Coral Wolf, who was five months pregnant at the time. Field work consisted of trudging through waist-high water and high-kicking through dense tropical rainforest. The team stayed well-hydrated by harvesting coconut water as needed.</p>
<p>Forty-one percent of the world&#8217;s most highly threatened vertebrates are found on islands, with invasive species introduced to islands being a leading cause of extinction. Removing invasive species from islands is an effective and proven way to save the world&#8217;s most vulnerable species. To date, there have been more than 500 successful projects to remove invasive rodents from islands. The pace, scale, and complexity of these efforts are increasing in recognition of the threat invasive species pose to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Coauthors Donald Croll and Bernie Tershy founded Island Conservation in 1994 to address these issues. They now lead the <a href="https://ccal.ucsc.edu/">Coastal and Conservation Action Laboratory</a> at UC Santa Cruz, where Wolf worked before joining Island Conservation. The Palmyra rat removal project&#8212;a partnership of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Nature Conservancy, and Island Conservation&#8212;was the result of more than seven years of planning and was the first step in a longer-term effort to restore the atoll&#8217;s ecological balance.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a96da4ec807270175cb4ed6be5b8d03e"><name>comic-con-panel</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Comic-Con panel features games program director Michael John</title><summary>Panelists will discuss the upcoming release of a remastered version of the Spyro the Dragon series of videogames, which John worked on 20 years ago as a designer and producer.</summary><keywords>Michael John, Games and Playable Media</keywords><start-date>1531810800000</start-date><display-name>Comic-Con panel features games program director Michael John</display-name><path>/2018/07/comic-con-panel</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/comic-con-panel</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1531850891368</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531851276220</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/michael-john-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/michael-john-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>michael-john-250.jpg</name><display-name>michael-john-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>45563</file-size><width>250</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Michael John</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/michael-john-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/michael-john-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>michael-john-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>michael-john-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15810</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Michael John</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Michael John</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/spyro-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/spyro-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spyro-250.jpg</name><display-name>spyro-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>55593</file-size><width>250</width><height>286</height></image><image-alt>Spyro the Dragon</image-alt><image-caption>Spyro the Dragon</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Panelists will discuss the upcoming release of a remastered version of the Spyro the Dragon series of videogames, which John worked on 20 years ago as a designer and producer</article-subhead><article-text><p>For fans of the classic videogame <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>, the upcoming release of a remastered version of the original <em>Spyro</em> trilogy is exciting news. At this week's massive <a href="https://www.comic-con.org/">Comic-Con International</a> convention in San Diego, the <em>Spyro</em> games will be the focus of a panel on Thursday, July 19, featuring Michael John, teaching professor and vice chair of the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu/">Games &amp; Playable Media master's program</a>, and others involved in the creation of the original games and the newly remastered collection.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, John was a producer at Universal Interactive Studios, where he worked with the development team at Insomniac Games on the first three games in the <em>Spyro</em> series, released from 1998 to 2000. Remastering the games means rebuilding them from scratch with updated graphics and other features.</p>
<p>"If you played the original game today, it would look dated because the graphics are not up to the same level as today's games," John explained. "The remastered version is essentially the same game&#8212;they've tried to match it as much as possible&#8212;but it looks really beautiful and modern."</p>
<p>The <em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy</em>, developed by Novato-based Toys for Bob and published by Activision, is scheduled for release on September 21, 2018. In a particularly satisfying twist for John, one of his students who graduated from the master's program in 2017, Max Fisher, has been working at Toys for Bob on the remastered games.</p>
<p>"When I'm teaching I use examples from that game sometimes. When I checked in with Max recently, he told me he couldn't believe what he was working on," John said. "It's unusual for a first job to get to work on such a high-profile project, so it's a great situation for him."</p>
<p>Joining John on the Comic-Con panel will be composer Stewart Copeland, former drummer for the Police, who composed the original <em>Spyro</em> soundtracks. John, a fan of the Police and of Copeland's subsequent work, recruited Copeland to work on the soundtrack by showing him a demo of the game backed with some of his music. John said he was impressed by the amount of work Copeland put into the soundtracks.</p>
<p>"One of the things I've learned, as I've been watching the chatter on social media about this remaster, is just how beloved those games were, and the music is a big part of that," he said.</p>
<p>Other panelists include Tom Kenny, the voice of Spyro the Dragon in the original and remastered versions, and key members of the Insomniac Games and Toys for Bob development teams.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a9ac151a807270175cb4ed6b43d81d3a"><name>tomorrows-training-excercise</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tomorrowâ€™s training exercise at Kresge College</title><summary>As shared last week, UC Santa Cruz will host a multi-agency training exercise from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday (July 18) at Kresge College.</summary><start-date>1531854000000</start-date><display-name>Tomorrowâ€™s training exercise at Kresge College</display-name><path>/2018/07/tomorrows-training-excercise</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/tomorrows-training-excercise</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1531854984344</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531855363414</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As shared last week, UC Santa Cruz will host a multi-agency training exercise from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday (July 18) at Kresge College.</p>
<p>The training will focus on emergency response to bomb threats. There will be a simulated flash bomb at 9 a.m. that may be audible in the immediate area, but not elsewhere on campus. The goal is to allow members of different public safety agencies to train together by handling a simulated incident at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The agencies participating include UC Police, Santa Cruz County Sheriff Bomb Squad, the FBI, UC Office of Emergency Services, UC Environmental Health and Safety, the 95th Civil Support Team, Santa County Hazardous Materials Incident Team, Santa Cruz County Environmental Health, Watsonville Fire Department, Aptos Fire Department, Central Fire Department, Santa Cruz Fire Department, and Scotts Valley Fire Department.</p>
<p>The training at Kresge&#8217;s Town Hall will include the loading dock behind the complex and Parking Lot 142. This should reduce the impact to the offices at the Owl&#8217;s Nest Cafe and the R-7 lofts.</p>
<p>Parking Lot 145 will be available for student employee and staff parking. The training will use parking lots 143 and 142.</p>
<p>Restricted areas include the R-9 building, the Town Hall, and the area above&#160;the recreation room adjacent to the Triplets.</p>
<p>Pedestrian traffic will be accommodated on the access road through Kresge.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CARE office will be closed for drop-in services on Wednesday.

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to get there and meet with different groups of students,&#8221; Naiman said. &#8220;I think this is a really unique time to be the dean of students. College campuses, in some ways, are microcosms of the society around them. This is a polarizing time in this country, and that tension in our national climate is being reflected on the campuses. That heightens the importance of supporting students who are trying to find their place in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naiman begins on Sept. 4. T.M. Robinson-Mosley has been serving as interim dean of students since January 2018.</p>
<p>Naiman&#8217;s home base will be in the <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu">Dean of Students Office</a> in Hahn Student Services, but the campus community can expect to see him on the move, roaming across the campus meeting with student groups. The dean of students position is part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu">Division of Student Success</a>. The dean of students listens to concerns; promotes wellness, leadership, volunteerism, and cultural competency; and encourages students to connect with services, programs, and resources, from event planning to volunteer opportunities and support for basic needs.</p>
<p>Currently, Naiman is executive director and chief of staff of UC Berkeley&#8217;s Center for Educational Partnerships, promoting equity and inclusion on campus. He supports 11 campus programs that assist college-bound first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students. Before taking that job, he worked for the Office of Admissions at UC Santa Barbara and in the Early Academic Outreach Program at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been interested in working for educational equity and access ever since I was an undergraduate,&#8217;&#8217; said Naiman, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2000 with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in cultural anthropology and religious studies. &#8220;That&#8217;s what got me interested in working in higher education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naiman went on to earn an M.Ed. in higher education and student affairs administration from the University of Vermont. He also holds a doctoral degree in international and multicultural education from the University of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Stevenson College Provost Alice Yang, part of the hiring committee for the dean of students position, said Naiman distinguished himself in a field of highly qualified candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;What made Garrett stand out was this really passionate and sincere commitment to supporting students with diverse backgrounds and multiple identities,&#8221; said Yang, an associate professor of history at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;We really felt that with his background and with his communication style, he would be able to promote a sense of belonging and inclusion among all students at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yang, who started teaching at UC Santa Cruz in the mid&#8211;1990s, noted that the campus community has changed dramatically in the past couple of decades. &#8220;Over 40 percent of the students are first-generation,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;We need to be sensitive to their needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hiring committee, which consisted of faculty, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students, was very impressed when they watched Naiman meet and talk with students at forums across the campus, Yang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very clear that he was concerned about getting their input and wanting to hear their concerns,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was important for us to find someone who can build a sense of trust with students as well as administrators.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="af756856807270175cb4ed6bc274dd94"><name>new-dean-of-students</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announcing a new dean of students</title><summary>I am delighted to announce that Garrett Naiman has been selected as UC Santa Cruzâ€™s new associate vice chancellor for student development and engagement, and dean of students.</summary><start-date>1531951200000</start-date><display-name>Announcing a new dean of students</display-name><path>/2018/07/new-dean-of-students</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/new-dean-of-students</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1531952064572</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531952594633</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am delighted to announce that Garrett Naiman&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/dean-of-students-appointment.html">has been selected</a>&#160;as UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s new associate vice chancellor for student development and engagement, and dean of students. He will start in this position on September 4, 2018.</p>
<p>Garrett has served within the University of California system since 2001, first as an admissions counselor and scholars program coordinator at UC Santa Barbara. After spending a few years at the University of Vermont, he returned to the UC as associate director of Academic Enrichment for the Early Academic Outreach Program at UC Berkeley, then deputy director. He subsequently moved to UC Berkeley&#8217;s Center for Educational Partnerships, where he most recently served as executive director and chief of staff to the assistant vice chancellor.</p>
<p>Garrett brings a passion for his work underscored by a commitment to equity and inclusion as well as a deep understanding of the complexity of a diverse campus environment. He has demonstrated a clear commitment to supporting students, recognizing the intersecting identities that influence and impact the student experience. With a doctorate of education focused on international and multicultural education and masters degree in higher education and student affairs, Garrett approaches his work through inclusion-based theories and best practices. He has demonstrated interest, ability, and experience in working with student groups and has served as a catalyst for collaborative efforts throughout his career.</p>
<p>Some recent examples of his thoughtful and collaborative leadership include co-writing a public response to &#8220;Free Speech Week&#8221; at UC Berkeley, which discussed controversial speakers that adversely affected members of the UC Berkeley community; leading his department&#8217;s response to ICE presence on and around campus so as to inform undocumented students and staff in a timely manner, while mitigating resultant fear and trauma; and participating on the Campus Student Code of Conduct Review Committee, looking at ways to make that process more accessible and equitable. The breadth and depth of Garrett&#8217;s experience will be of great benefit to the UC Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>I look forward to us welcoming Garrett to campus in early September.</p>
<p>I thank the search committee for its work, which was overseen by Division of Student Success chief of staff, Lucy Rojas.</p>
<p>In addition, I want to express my continuing gratitude to Mosley for her excellent leadership and stewardship while serving as interim dean of students. Her dedication to the work, to the organization, and to the students these past months has been remarkable and very much appreciated. Mosley will continue in this role through August.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Jaye Padgett, Vice Provost, Student Success</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="af80df0a807270175cb4ed6b3cf851d4"><name>academic-plan-for-our-future</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>An academic plan for our future</title><summary>We mark a milestone today with the release of a full draft of our Strategic Academic Plan and Implementation Playbook.

This vision for our future&#8212;along with a set of concrete steps to get us there&#8212;is the culmination of an exciting campuswide conversation about our strengths and about how we can further the impact of our research and teaching across the world.</p>
<p>I am deeply appreciative of our faculty, staff, and students who came together in this process. I sincerely thank members of the Steering and the Academic Advisory committees, both of which were integral to helping us reach this point.</p>
<p>I hope we will all be proud of the serious and inspiring intellectual work and insight that produced this plan, as well as of the plan itself, and that it will help UC Santa Cruz achieve even greater excellence and recognition.</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal and I invite you to study&#160;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19uMNU2WhF_reFSc3_R8vxopl63e8udwM">this full draft of the plan and implementation playbook closely</a>. Both will be reviewed by our Academic Senate this summer.</p>
<p>The plan includes our&#160;<strong>design principles</strong>, which are the clear, tightly defined guidelines that identify our institutional aspirations; the&#160;<strong>academic priority areas</strong>&#160;on which we will focus our efforts; and the&#160;<strong>institutional barriers</strong>&#160;to research, teaching, and learning that we have identified and outlined ways to overcome.</p>
<p>The playbook will help ensure that the Strategic Academic Plan is more than an aspirational document. It breaks our design principles down into goals, then provides a menu of concrete initiatives that advance us toward each goal. All of the initiatives are assigned to unit heads, and the implementation process will be tracked quarterly over the next five years.</p>
<h3>Academic priority areas</h3>
<p>A central aim of the our academic planning process was to identify and develop a handful of academic priority areas in which campus could invest additional resources over the next five years.</p>
<p>We facilitated the creation of Themed Academic Working Groups to inspire new collaborations and highlight the potential of existing collaborations across campus. Twenty-eight groups submitted written proposals and videos outlining how they aimed to advance research, teaching, and learning with the addition of resources and the elimination of internal campus barriers.</p>
<p>Hundreds of faculty, students and staff then provided assessments of the proposals, as did Academic Senate committees, Information and Technology Services, library officials, vice provosts, the Office of Research, and the Academic Advisory Committee (made up of faculty, students, and academic leadership). After reviewing the voluminous packet of proposals, videos, and campus feedback, the chancellor and I engaged in lengthy conversations on promising areas for investment.</p>
<p>The designated priority areas that follow are broader than any single proposal submitted by a working groups. In developing the three areas, we looked at the promise of the proposals, then considered how they built on existing campus strengths, advanced priorities critical to our mission, and the degree to which they represented distinctive research areas in which the campus had the potential to excel.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the designation of the following academic priority areas:</p>
<h4>Earth Futures</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This academic area considers a uniquely long view of the future of Earth and humanity&#8212;examining the question scientifically, philosophically, and practically, generating scenarios, and proposing strategic practices that will lead to particular outcomes. While this will require interplay between the temporally immediate and the distant, this positioning produces different kinds of questions and outcomes.</p>
<h4>Justice in a Changing World</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This academic area pays particular attention to the rapidly changing landscape of our world&#8212;environmentally, demographically, politically&#8212;rather than reading it as a static construct on which to apply theories or ask questions. It suggests a more nimble, critical, and interdisciplinary approach. This consciousness can provide more meaningful responses to the question, &#8220;How we can serve justice in the world?&#8221;</p>
<h4>Digital Interventions</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This academic area brings together makers, artists, inventors, and data scientists to make new creations and propose novel means of theorizing culture and the future. It is a primary realm for all those engaged in critically building or analyzing the digital world and its impact on human beings. It challenges us to imagine how advances in technology or thinking about technology can transform intellectual and material landscapes.</p>
<p>Later this month, Chancellor Blumenthal and I will invite a few faculty members whose Themed Academic Working Groups were integral to the priority areas we&#8217;ve established to work with other TAWGs and additional, relevant faculty across campus, to craft more detailed support proposals for consideration in the 2018-19 faculty FTE call. In so doing, we hope to both build on the inspired work of the TAWGs and further leverage faculty strengths from across campus.</p>
<p>This call will be the first of many steps toward realizing the future described in our Strategic Academic Plan.

At the same time, there is growing concern about contamination of groundwater supplies with nitrate from fertilizers, septic tanks, and other sources.</p>
<p>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz are addressing both issues with an ongoing program in the Pajaro Valley, where they have been implementing and studying groundwater recharge projects and evaluating methods to improve water quality as it infiltrates into the ground.</p>
<p>"As we ramp up groundwater recharge efforts, it's important to avoid contributing to problems with water quality. If we're putting good quality water into the ground, it will dilute any contaminants that are already in the groundwater," said Andrew Fisher, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In a study accepted for publication in <em>Water Research</em> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135418305827">available online</a>, Fisher's team showed that simply adding a layer of woodchips where water infiltrates into the ground can remove nitrate from the water by stimulating microbial activity in the underlying soil. Sarah Beganskas, who led the study as part of her Ph.D. thesis research, said the wood chips provide a source of carbon needed by denitrifying bacteria in the soil.</p>
<p>"We were able to see an increase in the removal of nitrate from the water and, at the same time, increased abundance of the microbes that carry out this process," she said. "Wood chips increased nitrate removal even at fast infiltration rates, which is important because recharge sites with high infiltration rates are often preferred."</p>
<p>Just as important is that wood chips are relatively inexpensive. "It has to be a cost-effective technology to be practical," Fisher said.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable groundwater management</strong></p>
<p>Fisher's groundwater research program is yielding valuable results just as California has begun a serious push for sustainable groundwater management throughout the state. Under the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) passed in 2014, new agencies are being established throughout the state to manage groundwater resources.</p>
<p>"This is a window of opportunity for us to get some of these ideas out there and give the agencies some choices and tools they can use," Fisher said. "California has an abundance of runoff. The problem is we don't have enough places to put it on the surface. We have a lot of space underground."</p>
<p>Fisher and his students have been working with the Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County to identify potential sites for groundwater recharge by mapping stormwater runoff and hydrologic conditions throughout Santa Cruz County and northern Monterey County. Their analysis identifies sites with both sufficient runoff and good conditions for infiltration of water into underlying aquifers. Their report, along with maps and other data from the project, is <a href="http://www.rcdsantacruz.org/managed-aquifer-recharge">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Beganskas noted that even in a dry year, a single intense storm can create a lot of runoff. Furthermore, many climate studies predict more extremes in precipitation patterns as global temperatures increase. That means more extremely wet years and extremely dry years. It also means more intense rainfall, with more of the rain running off rather than soaking into the ground.</p>
<p>"Both climate change and changes in land use, where development creates more impervious surfaces, are driving increased runoff. So that really motivates these efforts to collect runoff for recharging the aquifers," Beganskas said.</p>
<p><strong>Recharge net metering</strong></p>
<p>Fisher is also working to address the economic challenges of groundwater recharge projects. He proposed a program of "<a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/research/clee/research/wheeler/renem/">recharge net metering</a>" to help landowners recover the costs of installing and operating groundwater recharge basins on their property. It was approved by the Board of Directors of the Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency in 2016 for a five-year trial, and Fisher said he hopes the program can serve as a model for other regions facing similar challenges.</p>
<p>"We've been trying to hit the problem at multiple levels by partnering with regional agencies and collaborating with other researchers," he said. Fisher serves as campus lead for the <a href="http://ucwater.org/">UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</a> (UC Water), which is helping to build collaborations and partnerships to address water management issues.</p>
<p>The research on nitrate removal is part of a collaboration with microbiologist Chad Saltikov, professor and chair of microbiology and environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz, with funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. In ongoing studies, the researchers are comparing the effectiveness of different carbon sources as soil amendments to stimulate nitrate removal, and they are investigating similar approaches for addressing other contaminants.</p>
<p>"Nitrate is arguably the most pervasive groundwater contaminant, so that was our number one concern," Beganskas said. "We are starting to look at other contaminants as well, such as arsenic, which is a growing concern in some areas."</p>
<p>Fisher said the Pajaro Valley has been a good site both for testing practical solutions and for doing interesting scientific research. The area is heavily dependent on groundwater and faces serious problems from overpumping, including saltwater intrusion from the coast. As a result, landowners and the regional water agency are highly motivated to try strategies like managed aquifer recharge.</p>
<p>"And there's good science to be done," Fisher said. "These recharge ponds give us a spotlight on the processes that occur as water infiltrates into the ground, and our findings are helping us design effective recharge strategies."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.uctv.tv/sustainable-cal/search-details.aspx?showID=33844</url><title>UCTV Video: Growing Groundwater through Homes for Microbes</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucwater.org/</url><title>UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="afada07b807270175cb4ed6b3626c672"><name>golden-crowned-sparrows</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Among golden-crowned sparrows, a false crown only fools strangers</title><summary>Researchers can change dominance relationships between birds by altering the colors on their heads, but only if the birds don't already know each other.</summary><keywords>Bruce Lyon, UC Santa Cruz Arboretum</keywords><start-date>1532501700000</start-date><display-name>Among golden-crowned sparrows, a false crown only fools strangers</display-name><path>/2018/07/golden-crowned-sparrows</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/golden-crowned-sparrows</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1531955747893</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1532099759457</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/heads-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/heads-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>heads-400.jpg</name><display-name>heads-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>153592</file-size><width>400</width><height>534</height></image><image-alt>heads of golden-crowned sparrows with different coloring</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/bold-bird-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/bold-bird-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bold-bird-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>bold-bird-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19261</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>golden-crowned sparrow</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The brightness and coloring of the plumage on the heads of golden-crowned sparrows is highly variable.

A new study reveals that the sparrows have different ways to assess dominance status depending on whether the interaction is with a familiar bird or a stranger.</p>
<p>Previous studies by the UC Santa Cruz researchers showed that the patches of yellow and black plumage on the birds' heads serve as "badges of status," signals that correlate with fighting ability and allow birds to figure out who is dominant without having to fight. Birds with bold crown coloring are dominant over those with duller crown colors, regardless of whether the bold colors are natural or painted on by the researchers. Those were the findings of two studies published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.016">2011</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.034">2013</a>, in which the researchers staged confrontations by placing two birds captured in different locations together in an aviary.</p>
<p>"To show that birds are using badges of status, you have to pit birds against each other that have never met to make sure they do not have prior information about fighting ability," explained Bruce Lyon, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Lyon's lab has now been studying the Arboretum's golden-crowned sparrows for 15 years. The plumage studies have been led by Alexis Chaine, a former graduate student in the lab who is now at the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) station in Moulis, France.</p>
<p>In their latest study, <a href="http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/ele.13128">published July 25 in <em>Ecology Letters</em></a>, the researchers found that badges of status don't matter to golden-crowned sparrows that already know each other. The researchers can paint bold colors on the crown of a dull-colored sparrow and it will still be as subordinate to other birds in its flock as it was before the plumage makeover.</p>
<p>"Plumage manipulations do not fool birds that know each other," Lyon said, noting that the researchers decided to return to the plumage manipulation studies after subsequent studies revealed close affiliations between birds in winter flocks.</p>
<p>"The idea with badges of status is that they will be useful to animals that live in large or fluid social groups where they wouldn't be able to recognize and remember the fighting abilities of all the opponents they might encounter," he said. "We realized that the previous experiments we did with unfamiliar birds did not represent the social context in which these sparrows spend most of their time in winter."</p>
<p>The new findings show that golden-crowned sparrows use crown plumage to resolve dominance status with strangers, while social recognition governs dominance relations with familiar birds. The researchers have found that all yearlings have dull crown colors, but the plumage changes and becomes fixed in a bird's second year. At that point, there is tremendous variation in the crown plumage of different birds, but an individual's coloring remains the same for the rest of its life.</p>
<p>"Some of that is likely due to genetic variation, but it could also be affected by early experiences or developmental conditions. At this point, we just don't know," Lyon said.</p>
<p><strong>Social networks</strong></p>
<p>An understanding of the social networks of wintering golden-crowned sparrows emerged from work led by Daizaburo Shizuka, another former graduate student in Lyon's lab who is now at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. A study published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12304">2014</a> showed that the same birds come together in the same locations year after year, forming short-term feeding flocks that are subsets of distinct social communities with well-defined home ranges. They do this after migrating thousands of miles from their summer breeding grounds in northern Canada and Alaska, where instead of forming flocks, they fiercely defended small individual territories around nesting sites.</p>
<p>"The birds within each community return year after year to hang out with the same friends. It's not just that they overlap on the same turf. They appear to form very close lifelong winter relationships," Lyon said. "Normally, such close affiliations are driven by kinship, but our genetic study showed that kinship is not a factor in these communities. We suspect that these friendships are driven by the benefits of cooperation."</p>
<p>By forming flocks with familiar birds, golden-crowned sparrows are able to spend less energy on aggressive interactions and more time feeding, improving their chances of surviving through the winter. In their experiments, the researchers found that sparrows showed less aggression and spent more time feeding when paired with a familiar flockmate than when paired with a stranger.</p>
<p>Traditionally, researchers have looked for either badges of status or individual recognition as the mechanism for resolving dominance status in a given species, but not both. The system seen in golden-crowned sparrows, with context-dependent use of both mechanisms, may be more common than is currently recognized, Lyon said.</p>
<p><strong>Honest badges</strong></p>
<p>The roles of badges of status and individual recognition in dominance behavior raise many questions that have led to long-running debates among evolutionary biologists, he said. A key question for badges of status has been, what keeps them honest? The whole system would break down if, in the case of golden-crowned sparrows, crown patches did not correlate with fighting ability, allowing a "cheater" with bold crown coloring but poor fighting ability to dominate the seed pile.</p>
<p>In their new paper, however, the researchers suggest that the use of both badges of status and individual recognition in different contexts can diminish the value of a dishonest badge, because interactions within a social group no longer rely only on badges of status. "Badges of status might be used to settle dominance when a bird initially joins a group, but recognition subsequently modulates interactions," they wrote.</p>
<p>In addition to Chaine, Lyon, and Shizuka, the coauthors of the new paper include Theadora Block and Lynn Zhang, both of whom worked on the study as UCSC undergraduates (Block is now a graduate student in Lyon's lab). Lyon said dozens of undergraduates have been involved over the years in his lab's research on golden-crowned sparrows at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. In fact, the long-running research program began as a project for undergraduates in a class Lyon was teaching.</p>
<p>"It started out as a side project in our lab, and now it may be one of the most complete studies that have been done of winter flocks of migratory birds," Lyon said. "We still have a lot of interesting questions to investigate."</p>

<p>The grant will support operating costs for <em><strong><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/arts-future-garden.html">Future Garden for the Central Coast of California</a></strong></em>--a long-term environmental art installation by UCSC emeritus arts research professors Newton Harrison and his late wife Helen Mayer Harrison--that opened in May at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and Botanic Garden.</p>
<p>Grants from the Andy Warhol Foundation are awarded for scholarly exhibitions at museums, curatorial research, visual arts programming at artist-centered organizations, artist residencies and commissions, arts writing, and efforts to promote the health, welfare, and first amendment rights of artists.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of 42 recipients selected from a pool of 224 nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an incredible honor to be the recipient of a Warhol Foundation grant for the second time in three years,&#8221; noted John Weber, founding director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences. &#8220;We&#8217;re in truly select national company.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a strong project that is timely, and the chance to site the Harrisons&#8217; visionary&#160;<em>Future Garden </em>at the UCSC Arboretum and Botanic Garden was, I think, the clincher,&#8221; Weber added. &#8220;That brings a new, off-campus audience to the piece, perfectly complimenting its engagement with UC Santa Cruz's teaching and research in the arts and environmental studies.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Working with botanists at the Arboretum--along with other artists, scientists, and students--the Harrisons have created trial gardens inside three refabricated geodesic domes, where native plant species are being exposed to the temperatures and water conditions that have been projected for the region in the near future.<span> </span></p>
<p>The goal of their project is to determine which plants will thrive as the area warms due to climate change, and to cultivate those species to create the foundation for a more rapid regeneration of the local ecosystem while temperatures shift.</p>
<p>The Warhol Foundation previously awarded a grant to the campus in 2015 to support an innovative artist residency and exhibition developed by the Institute of the Arts and Sciences and the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in San Jose--in collaboration with the UC Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>That residency brought artist Russell Crotty, a 2015 Guggenheim Fellow, to the observatory to use Lick telescopes for direct observations and photographs that served as the basis for new, astronomy-based artworks.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/arts-future-garden.html</url><title>'Future Garden' environmental art installation opens at Arboretum</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/warhol-ias-grant.html</url><title>Warhol Foundation grant goes to Institute of the Arts and Sciences project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b95c9887807270175cb4ed6b6286e28a"><name>beyond-compliance-summer-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Beyond Compliance Summer Update from the CP/EVC</title><summary>I am pleased to provide an update about Beyond Compliance, our UC Santa Cruz initiative that engages faculty to help reshape campus culture with the goal of creating an environment free from sexual violence and sexual harassment.</summary><start-date>1532116800000</start-date><display-name>Beyond Compliance Summer Update from the CP/EVC</display-name><path>/2018/07/beyond-compliance-summer-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/beyond-compliance-summer-update</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1532118210593</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1532118675764</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to provide an update about Beyond Compliance, our UC Santa Cruz initiative that engages faculty to help reshape campus culture with the goal of creating an environment free from sexual violence and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>As you know, Beyond Compliance has been co-chaired by Associate Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Martin Berger and Senate Vice Chair Kimberly Lau. With Martin&#8217;s departure, I have appointed Physical and Biological Sciences Dean Paul Koch to serve with Kim as co-chair. In addition to his extensive administrative and Senate experience, Paul brings a nuanced understanding of SVSH issues in higher education and will continue to ensure Beyond Compliance remains attuned to the complexities underlying efforts at cultural change.</p>
<p>This past year, our Beyond Compliance working group collaborated with faculty, staff, and students to develop a series of programs and proposals around five key priority areas: best practices for supporting graduate students whose advisers may be placed on leave or dismissed as a result of a Title IX investigation; a faculty ambassadors program; a single reporting portal; learning communities to facilitate curriculum development; and a call for new course development.</p>
<p>When faculty members are placed on involuntary leave during SVSH investigations, or when they are disciplined for violations of university policy, there are invariably negative consequences for graduate students. In the past, when faculty have been unavailable to graduate students due to Title IX investigations or discipline, it has been left largely to individual departments, and the affected graduate students, to find replacement advisers, faculty who can write letters of recommendation, qualifying-examination committee members, etc.</p>
<p>To reduce the burden on departments and students, Beyond Compliance has developed a best practices guide to provide assistance in these situations. The guide offers an extensive list of potential adverse impacts, suggests who should serve as the point person for resolving the situation (and lists others who need to be involved), and provides a menu of potential solutions. It is our hope that the guide will aid departments and students in better understanding, and more efficiently resolving, problems that arise through no fault of students. The guide is currently under review by the campus counsel and my office. As soon as it is approved, Beyond Compliance will circulate it to the Graduate Student Association, the Division of Graduate Studies, and directors throughout the division for comment.</p>
<p>The Title IX Office provides training and education to the campus community on SVSH prevention, while also conducting investigations. But the office&#8217;s limited staff precludes them from meeting all of our educational needs. For that reason, Beyond Compliance has developed an ambassadors program that aims to train volunteer faculty members to serve as SVSH educators to the community. Working in conjunction with, and trained by, the Title IX Office, ambassadors will give public presentations at department or divisional meetings and serve as a resource for faculty members with SVSH-related questions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s our hope that the program will both increase the percentage of faculty with an understanding of Title IX policy and procedures and allow the Title IX Office to reach a vastly larger population. The program proposal is also currently under review by the campus counsel and my office. We hope to announce additional details in the fall.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Beyond Compliance members have heard repeatedly that faculty, students, and staff found it challenging to know where particular incidents should be reported. While our campus has many different reporting paths (for SVSH, hate/bias, faculty code-of-conduct violations, campus crime, etc.) it is not always clear to community members where a given incident or problem should be reported. To simplify reporting, I have engaged with Information Technology Services to build a single portal that will include links to every campus reporting site. I hope this will make reporting seamless and efficient for all members of our campus community. The new portal will go live in the fall. Stay tuned for additional details.</p>
<p>Finally, as an incentive for faculty to integrate courses on SVSH-related topics into departmental curricula, Beyond Compliance has created a competitive program offering course release to support the research and development of such courses. The&#160;<a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond-compliance/Documents/bc_cfp_2018-19.pdf">CFP</a>&#160;is now posted to the&#160;<a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond-compliance/">Beyond Compliance website</a>, and the first of a series of rolling deadlines is Sept. 24. In addition to this approach to developing new course offerings, Beyond Compliance will co-sponsor a faculty learning community with the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning for faculty interested in adding an SVSH-related unit into an existing course; we expect this program to take place during the Winter 2019 quarter.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC

Media</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Redneck Muslim, </em>a new short film by associate professor of film and digital media Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, is one of 25 films currently screening in the <strong><em>2018 PBS Online Film Festival</em> </strong>as a presentation of the PBS series <em>POV</em>.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p><em>POV</em> is television's longest-running showcase for independent non-fiction films. Since 1988, it has presented over 400 films to public television audiences across the country, premiering more than a dozen of the most innovative programs every year on PBS.</p>
<p><em>Redneck Muslim</em> tracks the life and work of Shane Atkinson, the first Muslim chaplain in-training at North Carolina&#8217;s biggest trauma center and founder of the "Society of Islamic Rednecks."</p>
<p>A 45-year old white man from Mississippi, Shane converted to Islam in 1999. Seeking to celebrate Southern culture with a reformed vision of &#8220;redneck&#8221; identity--stripped of racism and sexism and embracing diversity--he travels in the film to a gathering of African American Muslim leaders.</p>
<p>Taylor said she first came across Shane&#8217;s story after making a documentary film called "New Muslim Cool" that <em>POV</em> broadcast in the 2009 season on PBS.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of that previous work, Shane and I have a lot of friends and acquaintances in common,&#8221; Taylor explained. &#8220;So when he sent me a friend request on social media a couple of years ago, I looked at his profile and was intrigued by the links and mentions of the Society for Islamic Rednecks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, my friend and colleague Mustafa Davis and I had decided to make some new short films about American Muslims as a way to engage constructively with what we were seeing as an uptick in divisive, racist, and anti-Muslim rhetoric,&#8221; she added. &#8220;So Shane&#8217;s story seemed like a natural one to explore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor&#8217;s work has been screened at such venues as the Sundance, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Locarno Film Festivals, International Documentary Festival Amsterdam, Sundance Channel, Al Jazeera, and NHK-Japan. Her films include <strong><em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/taylor-pbs-race.html">Message To Zaire/The Talk</a></em></strong> for PBS, <strong><em><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/carmel-festival-documentary.html">Daisy and Max</a></em></strong> for Al Jazeera, <em>Visiting Day</em> for The Atlantic, <em>New Muslim Cool</em> for POV, the feature film <em>Paulina</em>, and the Emmy Award-winning <em>Home Front</em>.</p>
<p>Mustafa Davis, her co-director for the film,&#160;has worked extensively throughout the Middle East, Asia, and Africa as a filmmaker, photographer, and educator. Fluent in Arabic, his directing credits include the films <em>The Warm Heart of Africa</em>, <em>Prison Blues</em>, and <em>Deen Tight</em>.</p>
<p>"Over the years several filmmakers have made work that explores hybrid Muslim identities, among them my own 2009 feature documentary <em>New Muslim Cool</em>," Taylor noted. "But this short film also follows how Shane is re-shaping his own white, working-class identity in support of the struggle for racial justice--and I think that is something all white people need to think about right now, regardless of their faith background."</p>
<p>As for the film&#8217;s subject, Shane Atkinson, he said in a recent Q&amp;A on PBS that he hopes people will learn something from his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope people will see my story and come away with the understanding that we can never give up on each other. It is tempting to look at those we may disagree with and say they are the problem and they are unredeemable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Though we can't control others, we can look inward to see if we are the best version of ourselves,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Rather than demonizing those we may disagree with, we should always be true to our best selves and take the high road.&#8221;</p>

Miller Leadership and Service Award from the Western Association of College and University Housing Officers (WACUHO).</p>
<p>The award recognizes a current member of the association who has made significant contributions to WACUHO through their dedicated service and outstanding leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m honored to have been chosen for this award by an organization close to my heart,&#8221; Belisario said. &#8220;WACUHO has been my professional home organization for over two decades, and I value working with a group committed to furthering the field of student housing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In accepting her award, Belisario said, &#8220;I strive to be both kind and useful in my work, and I have found countless opportunities to do this as a part of WACUHO.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belisario has held a number of positions on the WACUHO executive committee including newsletter editor, president elect, and president. She&#8217;s been the historian for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Together with a group of WACUHO colleagues, Belisario is a founding member of geekEd., a group of educational professionals who explore experiences of and issues related to students who identify as &#8220;geeks.&#8221; The group has been presenting at various conferences since 2011, including San Diego Comic-Con International.</p>
<p>The Western Association of College and University Housing Officers is a professional organization dedicated to exceptional collegiate residential experiences by promoting meaningful connections and providing innovative, relevant professional development and services to its members.</p>
<p>Charles L. Miller was the 30th president of the association and exemplified the highest level of dedication to the profession, provided outstanding leadership and role modeling for seasoned veterans and new professionals alike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alex&#8217;s reputation as a strong leader and practitioner has brought many candidates for employment to UC Santa Cruz, many of whom were hired into career positions,&#8221; said Sue Matthews, associate vice chancellor for Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services. &#8220;Her leadership on the campus with her staff and with her students, in particular, has been transformative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belisario has been with UC Santa Cruz since 1995, when she was hired as an area coordinator (now known as a coordinator for residential education or CRE) at Crown College. She went on to serve as a college programs coordinator and associate college administrative officer. She was appointed the college administrative officer for Crown and Merrill Colleges in 2004 and now holds the title of senior director, college student life for Crown and Merrill colleges.</p>
<p>Belisario has served the campus by helping to develop and implement campus conduct dabases. She is also working with the group that has created the campus&#8217;s first online diversity and inclusion introduction, which will be launching for the incoming fall class.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to UC Santa Cruz because I love the college system.

<p>&#8220;Our unique position is framed by the strength of our research faculty, our innovation in interdisciplinary research and scholarship, our proximity to Silicon Valley, &#8216;the power of ten&#8217; that comes from being part of the UC system, and most importantly our commitment to social impact and diversity/inclusiveness,&#8221; Williams said. "I want to help leave the world a better place than I&#8217;ve found it. I can think of no other institution in the world that so deeply shares this goal as UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams started in his new role on July 2, replacing retired VC Mary Doyle and interim VC Brad Smith.</p>
<p>Williams has spent much of his professional life on the East Coast, working in a multitude of roles including chief technology officer and senior director of enterprise operations and solutions at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business. He holds a master&#8217;s degree in business administration from Stern, and a bachelor&#8217;s degree in classical civilization from NYU.</p>
<p>Williams has already begun meeting with each of the 240 staff members in the ITS organization. Williams said he has been impressed with how his new team has been offering consolidated IT services and support to the campus for more than 13 years. There are so many impactful projects taking place at UCSC, and one that he&#8217;s enthusiastic about is the metamorphosis of enterprise applications by leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) to better optimize IT efficiency through improved agility, stability, and security.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear to me that I am joining a team of dedicated, talented, professional, collaborative and forward thinking people who have taken the ITS organization on an amazing journey,&#8220; Williams said. &#8221;I am excited to be their new leader. I want to help show the world the reasons why Banana Slugs have no known natural predators. It&#8217;s because we rock!&#8221;</p>
<p>In his new role, Williams said he plans to build upon the strategic and operational excellence of both academic and administrative information technology to support and advance all aspects of the campus mission. He&#8217;ll be conducting several listening tours over the next few months to gather feedback from all campus constituents to help guide the creation of a new ITS strategic vision, including developing relationships with alumni and Silicon Valley business partners.</p>
<p>Williams, his wife, Kerry, and their three sons moved to Los Gatos in June. Kerry started her new job at UCSC Silicon Valley Extension on July 2.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c8758634807270175cb4ed6b236dff01"><name>changes-to-cruznet-wireless</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Changes to the CruzNet wireless system July 30</title><summary>On July 30, CruzNet will become a guest only WiFi service and be renamed to UCSC-Guest.</summary><start-date>1532365200000</start-date><display-name>Changes to the CruzNet wireless system July 30</display-name><path>/2018/07/changes-to-cruznet-wireless</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/changes-to-cruznet-wireless</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1532371502616</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1532371712011</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On July 30, CruzNet will become a guest only WiFi service and be renamed to UCSC-Guest.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>NOTE: On Friday, July 20, the UC Office of the President (OP) approved a 3 percent merit budget. More on this is described below.</strong></em></span></p>
<h4>Background: The UC Santa Cruz Pay for Performance Program for Policy-Covered Staff</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>The campus pay for performance program began in 2016 in alignment with President Napolitano&#8217;s pay for performance initiative. The merit program&#8217;s goal is to recognize stronger performers with higher salary increases. This is the third year pay for performance is included as part of our overall compensation and performance management practice.</p>
<p>This call for performance appraisals requires the concerted efforts of all campus managers and supervisors of staff employees. We have outlined the key elements below.</p>
<h4>Call for Performance Appraisals</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>The performance cycle runs from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>Appraisals for policy covered staff must be completed by Friday, July 27, 2018</li>
<li>Appraisals for represented staff are due Friday, August 31, 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions regarding these dates may be directed to your <a href="https://appraisals.ucsc.edu/appraisals/departmental-contacts">departmental contact</a>. (To access this link, you will be required to log in with your CruzID and blue password.</p>
<p>The purpose of performance management is to effectively engage teams in the mission of the university. The key to effective performance management involves a few basic elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crafting goals that are specific, important (mission-based) and measurable.</li>
<li>Frequent and candid feedback to all team members about their performance.</li>
<li>Coaching and support for staff to enable them to achieve their goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>When goals are well formed and feedback is occurring frequently, the annual performance appraisals become a time to summarize communications that have been occurring throughout the year. It is expected that all employees have an appraisal every year and is required as part of the annual pay for performance cycle.</p>
<h4>Online Appraisal Form</h4>
<p>Last year we developed an online form to replace the paper-based forms. The electronic form and process creates efficiencies and a smoother workflow.&#160; It is an interim tool for the campus to use until the implementation of the ePerformance module of UCPath, expected in September 2019.</p>
<p>Please note: <strong>All staff (represented and policy covered)</strong> should be appraised using the electronic form. This includes academic supervisors (Department Chairs, Principal Investigators, etc.) who will need to use the online appraisal form to evaluate their staff employees. If you are a supervisor of staff, you will need to use this new online form for the 2017/18 appraisal call.</p>
<p>Managers and supervisors are encouraged to keep appraisals succinct. It is not necessary to report each and every detail of performance. The appraisal is a summary of performance of key expectations including goals and core job responsibilities. It should focus on the impact of performance with a few examples and explanation of the overall rating.</p>

<p>Staff HR provides consulting and training to support managers and supervisors in completing appraisals. Your <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html">Employee Relations (ER) analyst</a> can provide you with advice and assistance in discussing pay for performance with your staff and in writing performance appraisals. <em><strong>As a reminder: when reviewing a performance issue that may warrant the rating of &#8220;improvement needed,&#8221; or &#8220;unacceptable ,&#8221; please engage with your ER analyst for assistance prior to delivering the performance appraisal.</strong></em></p>
<h4>Training on Performance Management</h4>
<p>Free training is available to help managers and supervisors conduct performance appraisals. If you need additional information on this topic please contact Teresa Roffe (<a href="mailto:roffe@ucsc.edu">roffe@ucsc.edu</a>) or Rhonda Rhodes (<a href="mailto:rhonda@ucsc.edu">rhonda@ucsc.edu</a>).</p>
<h4>Policy Covered Employee Merit Program</h4>
<p>This merit-based program determines salary increases based on individuals&#8217; performance and contribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eligibility</span>
<ul>
<li>Individuals appointed to career or partial-year positions covered by PPSM before January 2, 2018, at any UC location, and who are still on career or partial-year status at UCSC on July 1, 2018.</li>
<li>Non-probationary employees as of July 1, 2018.</li>
<li>Individuals who are still on the payroll as a career or partial-year employee as of the payout date.</li>
<li>Individuals with UC Santa Cruz contract appointments if so stipulated in the terms of the contract, and other eligibility criteria are met.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Structure</span>
<ul>
<li>The program has a 3 percent control figure. This is determined by calculating 3 percent of the sum of the salaries for eligible staff as of July 13, 2018. Divisions will determine salary increases within the 3 percent control figure and allocate to each employee. Employees with multiple funding distributions must receive the the same merit percentage for each distribution.</li>
<li>Given the 3 percent control figure, the recommended individual increase range for &#8220;met expectations&#8221; or better performance is 0 percent to 4.5 percent. However, managers are responsible for making these decisions and can take into account these factors:
<ul>
<li>Individual performance against goals (receives the most weight)</li>
<li>Position of the individual in their current pay range</li>
<li>Other salary actions that may have occurred during the year</li>
<li>Staff HR Compensation will provide merit rosters to units by the close of business on August 6, 2018, with information needed to determine merit increases. Merit process trainings will be available for department representatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The merit rosters must be completed and returned to Compensation by the close of business on August 24, 2018.</li>
<li>The effective date of pay increases will be July 1, 2018 for both biweekly and monthly paid employees. The new pay rates will appear on the September 19, 2018 paychecks for biweekly paid employees and on the October 1, 2018 paychecks for monthly paid employees.&#160; Pay for the retroactive portion of the increase (back to July 1, 2018) will appear on the October 31, 2018 paychecks for biweekly paid employees and on the November 1, 2018 paychecks for monthly paid employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>UC Santa Cruz and Silicon Valley leaders on Monday marked the 130th anniversary of <a href="https://www.ucolick.org/main/index.html">Lick Observatory</a>, which has been at the forefront of astronomical research since 1888.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible to overemphasize the value of Lick Observatory,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;While the UC Observatory headquarters is on the UC Santa Cruz campus, Lick and UCO are an excellent example of UC&#8217;s &#8216;Power of Ten.&#8217; UC&#8217;s 10-campus resource base allows for the building and maintenance of world-class facilities for education and research that no single campus could manage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The University of California owns and operates the facility, which was founded by a bequest from James Lick. The $700,000 gift was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of science and would amount to $1.2 billion today.</p>
<p>State Senator Bob Wieckowski (D-Fremont) presented a state resolution to Blumenthal on behalf of the South Bay legislative delegation in honor of Lick Observatory. The presentation took place at the observatory&#8217;s 36-inch Great Refractor telescope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human progress does not end with us looking up at the stars, but rather challenging ourselves to define what the next frontier will be,&#8221; said Wieckowski, the chair of the Senate Environmental Quality Committee. &#8220;We are here to recognize Lick for being a resource for our state for more than a century, and we are grateful to the team who continues to maintain this observatory. The research and educational programs here not only broaden our horizons, they inspire students who will become the next generation of astronomers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lick serves astronomers from all eight University of California astronomy campuses, as well as Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its users range in age from undergraduates to the most senior astronomers in the UC system. More than 100 observers are pursuing science programs at Lick at any given time. It is also the UC&#8217;s chief site for testing new technologies and instruments for optical astronomy. The technical facilities at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA upgrade existing instruments and develop new instruments for Lick Observatory.</p>

<p>--Kate Schatz</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong><em>Rad Girls Can: Stories of Bold, Brave, and Brilliant Young Women</em></strong> is the title of the latest book by UC Santa Cruz alumna Kate Schatz, the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of <em>Rad Women Worldwide</em> and <em>Rad American Women A-Z</em>.</p>
<p><em></em>It&#8217;s an inspiring collection of stories featuring a wide variety of amazing young women who have all made positive impacts on the world before the age of 20.</p>
<p><em>Rad Girls Can </em>includes teen activists like <strong>Lorella Praeli</strong>, who is currently leading the ACLU's efforts on immigration; the slam poetry group <strong>Muslim Girls Making Change</strong>; and 5-year old <strong>Sophie Cruz</strong>, who became one of the country&#8217;s youngest activists when she spoke with Pope Francis about legalizing her Mexican-born parents.</p>
<p>It also features <strong>Mary Beth Tinker</strong>, the 13-year-old whose peaceful Vietnam War protest led to a landmark Supreme Court case for students&#8217; free-speech rights; <strong>Yusra Nardubum</strong> a Syrian refugee who swam a sinking boat to shore, saved 20 lives, and then went on to compete as an Olympic swimmer; <strong>Trisha Prabhu</strong>, who invented an anti-cyberbullying app at age 13; and <strong>Barbara Rose Johns</strong>, whose non-violent, student-led high school protest helped start the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p>The 50 profiles are each paired with the expressive cut-paper portraits of artist Miriam Klein Stahl that helped make the first two Rad Women books so popular.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the current era of America, I don&#8217;t know of any books more important to inspire all young girls (and old dads like me) to succeed,&#8221; noted author and award-winning TV producer (<em>United Shades of America</em>) W. Kamau Bell. &#8220;This book should be required reading for all elementary schools. <em>Rad Girls Can</em> continues this essential series of books and takes it to new heights.&#8221;</p>
<p>A graduate of UC Santa Cruz in 2001<span>&#160;</span>with a B.A. in women&#8217;s studies and creative writing, Schatz is a writer, editor, educator, and feminist activist. She is also the former chair of the School of Literary Arts at Oakland School for the Arts, where she taught fiction, poetry, and journalism to 9th-12th graders for many years.</p>
<p>Schatz is additionally the co-founder of Solidarity Sundays, a nationwide network of feminist activist groups, and she speaks frequently about politics, resistance, feminism, race, and parenting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stories we share in <em>Rad Girls Can</em> give me an enormous amount of inspiration and motivation,&#8221; said Schatz. &#8220;It is our great hope that it does the same for every person, regardless of age or gender, who reads it. Because every day, there are millions of young people quietly, consistently, boldly creating the future. They are pushing the boundaries of technology and language, and how we think and talk about gender, race, and identity. They are dreaming and achieving and innovating and winning and inventing and being <em>rad</em>.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/alumna-rad-women.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz alum writes first childrenâ€™s book in City Lightsâ€™ 60-year history</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/11/global-women-worldwide.html</url><title>Alumna Kate Schatz pens second NY Times bestseller with â€˜Rad Women Worldwideâ€™</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/miriam-and-kate-casey-295.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/miriam-and-kate-casey-295.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>miriam-and-kate-casey-295.jpg</name><file-size>11636</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Author Kate Schatz and artist Miriam Klein Stahl at work on the book (photo by Casey Orr)</thumb-alt><title>Alumna author Kate Schatz spotlights â€˜rad girlsâ€™ under age 20</title><description>Rad Girls Can: Stories of Bold, Brave, and Brilliant Young Women is the title of the latest book by UC Santa Cruz alumna Kate Schatz, the New York Times best-selling author of Rad Women Worldwide and Rad American Women A-Z.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d76e165f807270175cb4ed6bac5b441f"><name>stanford-recovery</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New meta-analysis reveals pace and extent of river recovery </title><summary>A new global meta-analysis by UC Santa Cruz researchers reveals patterns of river responsiveness to disturbances such as oil spills, wastewater contamination, and fires.</summary><keywords>stream, river, ecology, ecosystem, oil spill, contamination, fire, bronwen stanford</keywords><start-date>1532588400000</start-date><display-name>Stanford-Recovery</display-name><path>/2018/07/stanford-recovery</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/stanford-recovery</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1532622672474</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1532622856710</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/stanford-streams-380.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/stanford-streams-380.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stanford-streams-380.jpg</name><display-name>stanford-streams-380.jpg</display-name><file-size>29672</file-size><width>380</width><height>252</height></image><image-alt>Close-up photo of a trout</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/07/images/stanford-streams-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/07/images/stanford-streams-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>stanford-streams-80.jpg</name><display-name>stanford-streams-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3192</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Close-up photo of a trout</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Measuring the recovery of trout such as this one can be used to track stream recovery after a disturbance.

A new global meta-analysis by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, reveals patterns of responsiveness in these highly valued ecosystems.</p>
<p>Based on studies of 50 incidents worldwide that affected river or stream water quality, the analysis found that streams improved but did not fully recover within the study period. Researchers also concluded that recovery in streams in more natural settings was less complete than for waterways in urban or agricultural areas.</p>
<p>"Waterways with more natural cover are more complex. They are typically home to more rare and sensitive species, because these are less stressful environments. They can support more species diversity," said lead author Bronwen Stanford, a doctoral candidate in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz. "In urban or agricultural landscapes, ecosystems are often dominated by fewer species and by generalists that do well with human disturbance&#8212;think worms and snails rather than frogs and mayflies. You've basically already selected for species that come back following a disturbance."</p>
<p>The paper, "Meta-analysis of the Effects of Upstream Land Cover on Stream Recovery," is available online now in <em>Conservation Biology</em>. Coauthors are Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, and Holly Jones, an associate professor of biology at Northern Illinois University.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis encompassed 37 published studies based on 50 incidents of water-quality disturbance in rivers that ranged from the Danube in Hungary to tiny headwater streams; more than half of the waterways are located in North America, which Stanford believes reflects the distribution of researchers and funding. "There's more funding for science in North America and Europe, and people study where they live," she said.</p>
<p>A total of 575 ecosystem responses were measured, including vegetation and fish and invertebrate populations. Forty-one of the disturbances were caused by human activities; only nine were natural, caused by fire, hurricanes, or volcanic eruptions. The median study period was two years, though the range was 20 days to 62 years; only seven sites were monitored for more than 10 years. Among the sites included in the meta-analysis were a South Carolina waterway where a 1996 diesel oil pipeline spill occurred, and a Pennsylvania wetlands project that was constructed to prevent coal-mine discharge from continuing to enter a stream in Loyalhanna Creek.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis revealed that more natural waterways&#8212;rivers and streams located in forests, prairies, grasslands, and wetlands&#8212;are less successful at coming back to pre-disturbance levels. But disturbances in those areas were also less devastating than incidents in waterways located in human-dominated landscapes, including urban, suburban, agricultural, and grazing lands.</p>
<p>To recover to their pre-disturbance condition, more diverse natural sites have to meet a "higher bar" than urban and agricultural lands that have already lost a lot of species, explained Stanford.</p>
<p>"They may be less successful at bouncing back, because they often support more valuable rare and sensitive species," she said. "Once they lose species or functions, it may be very hard to recover them. That makes it really important to protect these streams and rivers from disturbance in the first place."</p>
<p>Given the tremendous variability within streams and between one river and another, it's difficult to predict what might happen on a particular waterway. By analyzing outcomes on 50 streams, the meta-analysis illuminates overall patterns of response. The results are of value to land managers, who often must choose where to allow impacts and where to prioritize ecosystem protection, as well as to those who develop strategies to mitigate the impacts of development, such as the loss of wetlands and streams. "The more we know about recovery, the more realistic we can be about what we might get back after a disturbance," said Stanford.</p>

Ladybugs and soybean fields in the Midwest. These are well-known, win-win stories of how conserving natural habitat can benefit farmers.</p>
<p>But an international team of scientists found that natural habitat surrounding farm fields is not always an effective pest-control tool for farmers worldwide. Their analysis, led by researchers at UC Davis, appears in the July 30 edition of the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (PNAS<em>). </em>Among the dozens of scientists who contributed their field research databases to the analysis are two UC Santa Cruz professors of environmental studies: Stacy Philpott and Deborah Letourneau.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a widespread assumption among ecologists that when you have more natural habitat around farm fields you get more enemies of the crop pests, and that these enemies will control the pests and provide a benefit to growers,&#8221; said lead author Daniel Karp, an assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology.</p>
<p>To test that assumption, Karp and Rebecca Chaplin-Kramer of the Natural Capital Project at Stanford University organized an international team of ecologists, economists, and practitioners at the <a href="https://www.sesync.org/">National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center</a><span>. Together, they compiled the largest pest-control dataset of its kind, encompassing 132 studies from more than 6,700 sites in 31 countries worldwide &#8212; </span>from California farmlands to tropical cacao plantations and European wheat fields.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the results were highly variable across the globe. While many of the studies showed surrounding natural habitat does indeed help farmers control pests, just as many showed negative effects on crop yields. The analysis indicates that there are no one-size-fits-all recommendations for growers about natural habitat and pests.</p>
<p>&#8220;This paper isn&#8217;t telling farmers to clear habitat by any means,&#8221; Karp said. &#8220;There may be a lot of other benefits from natural habitat, such as pollination or carbon sequestration. But we need to be forthright about knowing when habitat conservation will be advantageous in terms of pests and when other means of pest control are needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strength of the findings is rooted in part in the size of the pest-control database, which Karp and his team of 153 co-authors have made publicly available, opening the door for further scientific insights.</p>
<p>"This shows the power of collaboration in scientific research," noted Philpott. "Many of us were surprised by the findings. Now, we will be able to continue the investigation, learn more, and hopefully be able to predict when surrounding habitat helps control pests and when it doesn't."</p>
<p>The research was supported by the <a href="https://www.sesync.org/">National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center</a> and the National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f1fba02d807270175cb4ed6bd4c3c27f"><name>human-trafficking</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Devastating events can drive human trafficking, paper shows</title><summary>Researchers found an uptick in online ads for sexual services mentioning Jamaican and Caribbean ethnicities following a 2016 hurricane in the Caribbean. &#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz doctoral student Sabina Tomkins has long been moved by the horrible stories of victims of human trafficking.</p>
<p>Victims of sexual slavery are subject to inhumane living conditions and psychological and physical abuse. They face starvation and drug addiction as a result of traffickers asserting control. Traffickers are even known to threaten and harm victims&#8217; family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to work on anything else because it&#8217;s so terrible that it happens,&#8221; said Tomkins, who is studying technology and information management.</p>
<p>Tomkins recently researched the link between extreme weather and human trafficking with postdoctoral researcher Golnoosh Farnadi and Professor Lise Getoor at UC Santa Cruz and Brian Amanatullah and Steven Minton at InferLink, a company that specializes in data extraction and integration.</p>
<p>InferLink approached the group at UC Santa Cruz with the problem of how events can impact security, and the team considered examining the effect of extreme weather on migration patterns before settling on human trafficking.</p>
<p>Their work on the link between extreme weather and human trafficking recently won a $300 best paper award at the Beyond Online Data workshop at the International Conference on Weblog and Social Media Data.</p>
<p>The authors wanted the money to be a positive force against trafficking and donated the award to two groups that combat human trafficking, Polaris, and Thorn.</p>
<p>Trafficking is a huge worldwide problem. On any given day in 2016 (when most recent data was available), an estimated 40.3 million people were victims of modern slavery according to the International Labor Organization. An estimated 25 percent of these victims were children.</p>
<p>Traffickers use the aspirations of ordinary people to lure them in as victims. They promise parents that their children are going to a good school abroad or tell young workers that they will get a promising new job.</p>
<p>For their paper, Tomkins and the other researchers first reviewed ads for sexual services on internet sites to see whether certain ethnicities turned up more frequently following Hurricane Matthew in the Caribbean in 2016 and Typhoon Goni in the Philippines in 2015. They found an uptick in ads mentioning Jamaican and Caribbean ethnicities in several Florida cities following the hurricane. They also found an increase in ads mentioning Philippine ethnicities in Dubai. This seems to show that certain populations were more likely to be recruited as prostitutes following the storms.</p>
<p>&#8220;These events create vulnerabilities,&#8221; Tomkins said. &#8220;When you don&#8217;t have a home, you can become prey to traffickers who know how to take advantage of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the next part of the paper, Tomkins reviewed how storms affect where traffickers advertise their services. In Jacksonville, Fla., she found that ads for sexual services dropped on the day of the hurricane.</p>
<p>Finally, Tomkins proposed a predictive model that could anticipate where traffickers might go after a storm and how their movements might change. The model used phone numbers used by traffickers to study their locations.</p>
<p>Lise Getoor, Tomkins&#8217; adviser, praised Tomkins for her intense and careful work integrating disparate data from different places. Her paper makes an important contribution to fighting human trafficking, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That can give us clues on how we safeguard people better and how we prevent this from happening,&#8221; Getoor said.</p>
<p>Tomkins is defending her thesis at the end of this month and then heads to Harvard University for a post-doctoral fellowship &#8220;working on algorithmic and machine learning methods for use in constructing mobile health interventions.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she will be investigating interventions for people using a mobile health app for smart phones. As an example, an app could send someone trying to get over the flu reminders to sleep, eat right and get their medicine.</p>
<p>Tomkins said it&#8217;s another way she is using data science to help promote social good. She has also worked on ways to detect cyber bullying on social media, understand the effectiveness of online educational programs for high school students, and recommend systems for sustainable product choices.</p>
<p>Tomkins has been interested in data science since she was an undergrad because it gives offers &#8220;sanity checks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know if you&#8217;re right if you&#8217;re theorizing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be able to track things with data and to be basing your theories on something you see.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2755ac3807270175cb4ed6b95a1d6f8"><name>in-memoriam-calderon</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Armando Luis Calderon</title><summary>Armando Luis Calderon served at UC Santa Cruz as an assistant cook for Dining Services since September 2003.</summary><start-date>1533020400000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam</display-name><path>/2018/07/in-memoriam-calderon</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/in-memoriam-calderon</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1533076133396</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1533076133396</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is with deep sadness that we write to tell you the death of Armando Luis Calderon.

From working on such movies as&#160;<em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>,&#160;<em>American Beauty</em>&#160;(for which he won a Grammy),&#160;<em>The&#160;Help</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Skyfall</em>&#160;to many Pixar hits including&#160;<em>Finding Nemo</em>,&#160;<em>Wall-E</em>, and&#160;<em>Finding Dory</em>&#8230;it seems like every project he touches is a resounding success.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Highland Park, just outside of Chicago, he attended a high school that luckily offered extensive programs in the arts, especially in music and theater, setting a spark that would deeply influence his future. &#8220;I enjoyed acting in the musicals, and also playing alto saxophone with the marching band and jazz ensembles,&#8221; he remembers. &#8220;I also played bass and guitar in various extra-curricular rock groups. I still will jump at any chance to play or perform.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it came time to select a college, Bernstein&#8217;s goal was to escape the harsh Midwestern winters and head towards the sun. Having enjoyed visiting his brother, who was living in the Bay Area, convinced him to start looking at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and schools in the Los Angeles area. But then when he happened to check out UC Santa Cruz along the way, everything clicked. &#8220;I was taken with the scenery and mellow attitude. It seemed like a perfect fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a resident of Cowell College, he had a blast playing music, taking long hikes in the surrounding woods, and burning the midnight oil playing Avalon Hill board games with his dorm buddies. They would also venture into town, going to favorite places like India Joze and Lulu Carpenter&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Bernstein was a big part of the local music scene, too, joining several bands, and performing in one band called Sweet Release that opened for Tower of Power at a UCSC-sponsored concert in the fields below Cowell. Another band he was part of, Dance or Die, was a finalist in the Battle of the Bands at the Catalyst.</p>
<h3>"I had some marvelous teachers at UCSC"</h3>
<p>His expertise in studio recording evolved by spending many nights in the Communications building learning the basics on two, four-track tape decks and a Moog synthesizer. &#8220;I had some marvelous teachers at UCSC,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Both&#160;<strong>Randy Masters</strong>&#160;and&#160;<strong>Gordon Mumma</strong>&#160;were very influential in my musical development.&#160;It was through Randy&#8217;s jazz improv class that I met many musicians who became friends and band mates, and it was Gordon&#8217;s electronic music program that gave me access to the studio in the Communications building.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other professors that he remembers fondly are astrophysicist&#160;<strong>Peter Bodenheimer</strong>, as well as&#160;<strong>Forrest Robinson</strong>&#160;who taught one of his favorite courses &#8211; a literature class that focused on the works of Mark Twain and William Faulkner.</p>
<p>An unexpected bonus of being at UCSC came when he was sharing a house at the corner of Mission and Walnut streets (since torn down) and met a new roommate. &#8220;The house had vines growing in through the cracks and an old pot-bellied wood stove for heat and five or six bedrooms where a parade of students came and went over the years,&#8221; he recollects. &#8220;One winter I got back from a road trip and found we had a new housemate &#8211; a tall, long-haired woman finishing a degree in Latin-American studies at Merrill. We started hanging out and cooking together and one thing led to another. My wife Marianne and I have been together for nearly 35 years now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though Bernstein was a naturally gifted musician, he was fascinated by math and computer science. It was an especially exciting time for the computer industry when personal computers were still a relatively new phenomenon and an upstart company called &#8220;Apple&#8221; was disrupting the status quo. Bernstein found work after graduation as a computer consultant, creating programs for companies that wanted to have computers but weren&#8217;t exactly sure what to do with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked for various businesses including a stint at the Roaring Camp railroad in Felton, where I designed software to handle the reservations and confirmations,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I remember driving in to work through the mist hanging among the massive redwoods. I loved that job.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time, not only were personal computers gaining ground, but film was starting to be replaced by video, especially for post-production projects in Hollywood. Bernstein&#8217;s brother, who was working at the time as a picture editor in Los Angeles, asked him to help out on a project that was bringing film-based music scoring techniques into the realm of video. That led to Bernstein deciding to move to LA so he could be closer to the project and pursue his career.</p>
<h3>"There was no digital <em>anything</em>..."</h3>
<p>&#8220;My math and programming skills were essential here,&#8221; he says of the project. &#8220;The system we created eventually garnered an Academy Technical Achievement award&#8230;.Working on that project brought me into the world of music editing.&#8221; He was also in the industry when one still had to work with actual film, including reels, spools, rewinds, and synchronizers. &#8220;There was no digital&#160;<em>anything</em>&#8211; it was a much more physical job, and if you made an error cutting there was no undo button.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along the way, as one job turned into more and better opportunities, Bernstein met a young composer named&#160;<strong>Thomas Newman</strong>, who became one of the most renowned film score composers in the industry with 14 Oscar nominations and six Grammy wins. Nearly 30 years later, they are still close collaborators, having worked together on numerous critically acclaimed films including&#160;<em>Bridge of Spies</em>,&#160;<em>The Help</em>,&#160;<em>Saving Mr. Banks</em>,&#160;<em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em>,&#160;<em>American Beauty</em>,&#160;<em>Little Children</em>,&#160;<em>Jar Head</em>,&#160;<em>Finding Nemo</em>,&#160;<em>The Green Mile</em>, and many more.</p>
<p>Bernstein says that he especially has enjoyed working on animated films for Pixar and loved being able to work in London during the James Bond movies&#160;<em>Skyfall</em> and&#160;<em>Spectre</em>. &#8220;Animation is a fascinating process and it&#8217;s inspiring to have an inside view of how the people at Pixar set the standard with their cleverness and attention to detail,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>He continues to work with very high-profile directors and musicians having won a Grammy Award for co-producing the soundtrack of&#160;<em>American Beauty</em>, and several Golden Reels awarded by the Motion Picture Sound Editors, USA. He also has a technical Academy Award for the design and development of the Streamline Scoring System, Mark IV, for motion picture music editing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a nice plaque and certificate,&#8221; he says of the Academy Award, but, sadly, no statuette [is given in this category].&#8221;</p>
<h3>"I never won an Oscar...it's a sore subject"</h3>
<p>And what about winning an actual Academy Award someday? &#8220;I have never won an Oscar,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sore subject because there&#160;<em>isn&#8217;t</em>&#160;an Oscar for music editing. For&#160;<em>sound</em>&#160;editing &#8211; sure! For sound&#160;<em>mixing</em>&#8211; sure! Don&#8217;t get me started!&#8221;</p>
<p>For students who want a career in music editing, Bernstein suggests that they learn many skills, watch films critically, and start seriously networking and making key connections. &#8220;Collect a posse,&#8221; he advises. &#8220;Your college friends are your future colleagues. Get involved in student projects, meet people, and engage your teachers. Connections are the most powerful tool to finding work, and potential collaborators are all around you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to get to know music by playing an instrument as well as becoming familiar with sound engineering and recording. &#8220;Make a YouTube video. Learn Pro-tools thoroughly, and become familiar with audio-processing plug-ins,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Understand midi, and how sequencers interface with digital audio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really paying attention to the sound mix and music while watching movies is critical, as well. &#8220;Where does the music enter and where does it go out? Why were certain colors used; what is the mood and tone of the music? Why do you think those choices were made?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bernstein also encourages students to be prepared and ready. &#8220;The more skills you have, the greater the chance of being able to slot into whatever opportunity might present itself.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="7051dbf680727017273daba402055217"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1530432000000</start-date><path>/2018/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/07/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1513712901094</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1513887820820</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
