How they do this, however, is one of the fundamental mysteries of biology.</p>
<p>A new study, <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)31594-4">published December 28 in <em>Current Biology</em></a>, reveals a complex network of signals and feedback loops that control both cell growth and size in yeast. At the heart of the network is a protein complex called TORC2, which is disrupted in many cancer cells.</p>
<p>"One of the most universal defects in cancer is aberrant cell size and shape. It's what the pathologist looks for, and the worse those defects are, the worse the prognosis," explained Douglas Kellogg, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the study.</p>
<p>Yeast is a relatively simple organism, yet it works in the same fundamental ways as human cells. The same signaling network that controls cell growth in yeast is thought to operate in more complex organisms too, including humans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamental discoveries in yeast are directly applicable to humans," Kellogg said. "If we can understand how growth control works in normal cells, and how it goes wrong in cancer cells, we could potentially exploit that knowledge to kill cancer cells."</p>
<p>The new study looked at how cell growth and size are limited by the availability of nutrients. In previous work, Kellogg's team had identified a protein required for nutrient modulation of cell size. Further investigation showed that this occurs through the protein's effects on the TORC2 signaling network.</p>
<p>Led by co-first authors Rafael Lucena and Maria Alcaide-Gavil&#225;n, both postdoctoral researchers in Kellogg's lab, the team used a variety of techniques to work out the details of how molecular signals are relayed through this network, enabling the cell to respond to changing nutrient levels. A key role in this process is played by ceramides, which are building blocks for structural molecules in the cell membrane. The study found that ceramide-dependent signals control both cell size and growth rate.</p>
<p>"The same signals control growth rate and cell size, which explains why cell size is proportional to the growth rate set by the availability of nutrients," Kellogg said.</p>
<p>Additional work is needed to clarify some details of the signaling network and explore its effects throughout the cell. Kellogg is also eager to apply the new findings to studies of human cells.</p>
<p>He noted that in advanced biology textbooks, the section on cell growth is typically just one page long, and cell size is covered in a short paragraph. "We want to write a whole new chapter on cell growth and size for the textbooks," Kellogg said.</p>
<p>In addition to Kellogg, Lucena, and Alcaide-Gavil&#225;n, three UC Santa Cruz undergraduates contributed to this research and are coauthors of the paper: Katherine Schubert (now a UCSC graduate student), Maybo He, and Matthew Domnauer. Other coauthors include Catherine Marquer at Columbia University Medical Center, and Christian Klose and Michal Surma at Lipotype GmbH in Dresden, Germany. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page current="true" id="7051d66180727017273daba42ac20bed"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1514797200000</start-date><path>/2018/01/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1513712899664</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1513976481070</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page><system-page id="7ffe0c1980727017273daba4db3152c3"><name>year-of-alumni-alonso-axel</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Axel Alonso: Diversity’s superhero</title><summary>Axel Alonso was editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics from 2011–2017, where he built a legacy by making comic book characters and their creators reflect the diversity of our world.</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Axel Alonso: Diversity’s superhero</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-alonso-axel</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-alonso-axel</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1513975842666</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518822851100</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/alonso.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/alonso.gif</link><site>news</site><name>alonso.gif</name><display-name>alonso.gif</display-name><file-size>28015</file-size><width>400</width><height>481</height></image><image-alt>Axel Alonso portrait illustration.</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Cowell ’87, sociology
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axel Alonso was editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics from 2011&#8211;2017, where he built a legacy by making comic book characters and their creators reflect the diversity of our world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his tenure at Marvel, Alonso, 50, oversaw the creation of a Muslim superhero, a female Thor, and a biracial Spider-Man, among others. He also signed National Book Award winner and MacArthur genius Ta-Nehisi Coates to pen the latest Black Panther series and hired two black female writers, a rarity in the industry. Before working for Marvel, Alonso was an editor for DC Comics from 1994 through 2000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alonso grew up in San Francisco, the son of Mexican and English immigrants. His comic books of choice, he says, were cinematic heroes like The Hulk and Luke Cage&#8212;until basketball and girls cooled his ardor at age 12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while working on an Alaskan fishing boat to earn money for college, Alonso stumbled across Alan Moore&#8217;s Swamp Thing, which, he says, &#8220;hit my sweet spot. It was smart and literate and made me go back to see how comics had changed and why.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a financially unrewarding stint as a journalist, he got a job as a comic book editor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Marvel, Alonso cemented his desire to make sure readers of all races, nationalities, and religions could see themselves in the pages of comic books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have mixed-race kids,&#8221; says Alonso, whose wife is of Korean descent, &#8220;and I want them to see their reflections.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8006092d80727017273daba44824062d"><name>year-of-alumni</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Recognizing and applauding Slugs with 'Year of Alumni'</title><summary>This year will be a time to recognize the burgeoning numbers and oversized impact of Banana Slugs, who are thriving in fields ranging from agroecology to astrophysics to medicine.</summary><start-date>1514836800000</start-date><display-name>year of alumni</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1513976366289</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1516302802041</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/12/images/YOA-badge-print-size</path><link>site://news/2017/12/images/YOA-badge-print-size</link><site>news</site><name>YOA-badge-print-size</name><display-name>YOA-badge-print-size</display-name><file-size>56140</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/12/images/YOA-thumb</path><link>site://news/2017/12/images/YOA-thumb</link><site>news</site><name>YOA-thumb</name><display-name>YOA-thumb</display-name><file-size>25035</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Campus to pay tribute to a growing alumni base that is thriving in fields from agroecology to astronomy, and making a mark on the world </article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has designated calendar year 2018 as the&#160;Year&#160;of&#160;the&#160;Alumni, a time to savor, celebrate, and promote the legacy&#160;of&#160;proud Banana Slugs who have made their mark on the world.</p>
<p>Compared with many other universities, this campus&#8212;a mere 52 years old&#8212;is a youngster. And yet, the mighty Slugs are everywhere. In fact, if all those graduates were to band together and form their own city of 120,000 people, it would have nearly twice the population of Santa Cruz, the town that has hosted this &#8220;City on a Hill&#8221; since 1965. And it is a youthful group&#8212;about half of our alumni have graduated in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>This year will be a time to recognize the burgeoning numbers and oversized impact of Banana Slugs, who are thriving in fields ranging from agroecology to astrophysics to medicine. Large numbers&#160;of&#160;alumni&#160;work at successful Silicon Valley companies including Google, Facebook, and Apple.</p>
<p>&#160;Others have flocked to the <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/features/hollywoods-best-kept-secret">entertainment industry</a>, where they have excelled in everything from production design to cinematography, movie directing, screenwriting, sound-editing, and executive-producing. Banana Slugs are <a href="https://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/alumni/">writing the books the world wants to read,</a> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/gillian-welch-songwriting.html">singing the songs that move our spirits</a>, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/03/perez-carmen-alumni-weekend-keynote.html">marching for recognition</a>, and&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/03/perry-award.html">making civil rights history. </a></p>
<p>Journalistic Slugs like the double <a href="https://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/alumni/alumni-interviews/alumni-interviews-mendoza.html">Pulitzer Prize-winning Martha Mendoza</a> (Kresge &#8217;88, independent major, journalism and education) are, quite literally, writing the wrongs of the world. No sphere is off limits for the mighty Slug. You will find graduates from UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/09/dylan-archivist-alumnus.html">archiving the lyric sheets of Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-townsend.html">plunging down insanely steep slopes</a>, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-nelson.html">preserving and revitalizing native cultures,</a> &#160;<a href="http://magazine.ucsc.edu/2017/03/alan-lovewell-fishing-for-change/">encouraging sustainable fishing practices</a> and healthy eating, &#160;<a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu/nprs-jesse-thorn-returns-to-his-roots-in-santa-cruz/">ruling the airwaves with their wit and wisdom</a>, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-sparrow.html">standing up for the First Amendment</a>, and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/julie-snyder-feature-story.html">turning serial podcasts into cultural juggernauts</a>.</p>
<p>You might already know that UC Santa Cruz graduates have reached for the stars and to the bottom of the ocean. In fact, one distinguished alumna, <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4491">Kathryn Sullivan</a>&#160;(Cowell &#8217;73, Earth sciences), the first American woman to walk in space and the former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has done both. But did you know that UC Santa Cruz ranks fourth among universities whose recent graduates work with City Year, a national organization that partners with schools to provide tutoring, mentoring, and behavioral assistance for more than 150,000 students, helping reduce dropout rates and boost test scores? &#160;</p>
<p>Making the world a better place is one of the campus&#8217;s founding values, so it is not so surprising that you will find graduates <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-loftin.html">changing the narrative around higher education</a> in the United States and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-hibbard.html">teaching economic self-sufficiency to women in impoverished places</a>. These UC Santa Cruz graduates are taking the values they learned on campus into the larger world.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/">Alumni Weekend</a>, April 27&#8211;29, will provide an excellent forum for celebrating and recognizing the experiences and contributions of all of our alumni.</p>
<p>See our&#160;<a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/index.html">special series of stories</a> highlighting the achievements of a spectrum of Slugs, and stay tuned for an array of events and activities designed to bring awareness to Slug impact, ingenuity, creativity, bravery, sustainability, volunteerism, and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Laird has watched his political capital rise over the years. In 1983, while serving on the Santa Cruz City Council, he became one of the first openly gay mayors in the United States. He went on to serve three terms as a California state Assemblyman before starting his current job as California's Secretary for Natural Resources.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this proud alumnus never lost touch with his alma mater while ascending through the world of politics. In fact, he touched down on campus in 2015 to deliver a simple, bold, effective, and charming commencement address message to the crowd at Cowell College: take big risks, and always make sure to pay it forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When I graduated from UC Santa Cruz, it was illegal to be gay in all 50 states," Laird told the crowd. "When I sat at my graduation, I was just coming to terms with the fact that I was gay. And I thought I would have to choose between being clear about who I was, and moving ahead in the field of public policy that I thought I was best suited for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I took a risk," Laird continued, "not knowing whether I was on the right side of history&#8212;but knowing I was doing what was right."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz gave him an edge as he went on to pursue a lifetime of public service, he later said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Packard helped found the Monterey Bay Aquarium and has served as the aquarium's executive director since it opened in 1984.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on a lifelong passion for science and nature, she has led the aquarium to become a global force for ocean conservation. She chairs the board of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, a global leader in deep ocean science and technology, and she is deeply engaged in ocean conservation strategies through her work as a trustee of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. She served as a member of the Pew Oceans Commission, which published a blueprint for improving governance of America's ocean waters, and more recently served on the California Parks Forward Commission to develop a sustainable path for California's state parks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packard was the 1998 recipient of the Audubon Medal for Conservation. In 2009, she was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the nation's most prestigious honor society, and was named a California Coastal Hero. In 2010, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation in recognition of her "tireless career commitment to marine conservation."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Packard, "I am hugely grateful for the opportunities UC Santa Cruz gave me as an undergraduate to spend time with top research scientists and be able to do science, not just hear about it."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="802ec86580727017273daba4afa07fda"><name>year-of-alumni-nagano-kent</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Kent Nagano: The maestro</title><summary>Kent Nagano is an internationally acclaimed opera and symphony conductor who is renowned for interpretations of clarity, elegance, and intelligence.</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Kent Nagano: The maestro</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-nagano-kent</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-nagano-kent</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1513979037722</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518823232365</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/nagano.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/nagano.gif</link><site>news</site><name>nagano.gif</name><display-name>nagano.gif</display-name><file-size>37065</file-size><width>400</width><height>488</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Porter ’74, music, sociology

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kent Nagano is an internationally acclaimed opera and symphony conductor who is renowned for interpretations of clarity, elegance, and intelligence. He has served as music director of the Orchestre symphonique de Montr&#233;al since 2006. In 2013, he became artistic advisor and principal guest conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and in 2015, he took up the position of general music director of the Hamburg State Opera and chief conductor of the Philharmonic State Orchestra. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nagano's early professional years were spent in Boston, working with Seiji Ozawa at the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1984, Olivier Messiaen selected Nagano to assist in premiering his opera, Saint Fran&#231;ois d'Assise. He became the first music director of the Los Angeles Opera in 2003. A much sought-after guest conductor, he has worked with most of the world's finest orchestras, including the Vienna, Berlin, and New York Philharmonic Orchestras. He has recorded widely, receiving multiple Grammy Awards as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">well as multiple prizes from Grammophone, Grand Prix du Disque, Edison, ECHO, and Musical America (Conductor of the Year).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When I began my relationship with UC Santa Cruz in 1969," recalls Nagano, "the university was just starting out. Its unique structure placed exceptional scholars in close working relationships with students, which meant that one could find so many inspirational mentors. The faculty were the most qualified and brilliant you could find anywhere."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8033a39e80727017273daba4d34b3362"><name>year-of-alumni-sullivan-kathy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Kathy Sullivan: From the sea to the stars</title><summary>A scientist, astronaut, and award-winning educator, Kathy Sullivan was the first American woman to walk in space and is the former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Kathy Sullivan: From the sea to the stars</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-sullivan-kathy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-sullivan-kathy</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1513979355853</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518823409751</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/sullivan.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/sullivan.gif</link><site>news</site><name>sullivan.gif</name><display-name>sullivan.gif</display-name><file-size>29879</file-size><width>400</width><height>567</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Cowell ’73, Earth sciences
</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scientist, astronaut, and award-winning educator, Kathy Sullivan was the first American woman to walk in space and is the former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accomplished oceanographer, Sullivan earned a Ph.D. in geology at Dalhousie University in Canada after graduating from UC Santa Cruz. She served as a member of three NASA space shuttle missions and dived 8,500 feet to the East Pacific Rise in the deep-sea submersible Alvin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan served as NOAA administrator from March 2014 to January 2017. She had previously served as NOAA's deputy administrator and chief scientist, overseeing a research and operations portfolio that ranged from fisheries biology and climate change to weather forecasting and satellite construction. Before returning to NOAA, she served for 10 years as president and CEO of the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, one of the nation's leading science museums, and as the inaugural director of the Battelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy at Ohio State University. She has also served on the National Science Board and as an oceanographer in the U.S. Navy Reserve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan entered UC Santa Cruz as a foreign languages major and discovered she needed three science classes to fulfill general education requirements. After trying what she described as "every trick in the book to get out of the requirement," Sullivan enrolled in oceanography and Earth sciences classes, which proved a turning point in her life. She still recalls the strong encouragement and support she received from faculty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The faculty let learning flourish," she says. "We pursued discovery together, and they treated us like peers.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8036d11d80727017273daba448d37272"><name>year-of-alumni-beggs-kevin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Kevin Beggs: Television visionary</title><summary>As chairman of the Lionsgate Television Group, Kevin Beggs places a high premium on creativity, risk, and, in his own words, “going where others won’t.”</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Kevin Beggs: Television visionary</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-beggs-kevin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-beggs-kevin</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1513979564155</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518822982837</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/beggs.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/beggs.gif</link><site>news</site><name>beggs.gif</name><display-name>beggs.gif</display-name><file-size>26518</file-size><width>400</width><height>506</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Porter ‘89, politics/theater arts
</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As chairman of the Lionsgate Television Group, Kevin Beggs places a high premium on creativity, risk, and, in his own words, &#8220;going where others won&#8217;t.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beggs oversees the entire TV portfolio at Lionsgate, one of the largest independent television businesses in the world. Since joining Lionsgate in 1998, Beggs has guided the Television Group&#8217;s growth into a leading supplier of content for streaming, cable, and broadcast networks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lionsgate&#8217;s roster of nearly 90 shows on more than 40 networks includes ground-breaking series such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange is the New Black</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear White People</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Netflix), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Hulu), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nashville</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CMT/Hulu), the syndication success </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wendy Williams Show,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the upcoming </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step Up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (You Tube Red), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rook</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Starz), and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kingkiller Chronicle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Showtime).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beggs has also been responsible for Lionsgate&#8217;s iconic, multiple Emmy Award winner </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mad Men,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eight seasons of Showtime&#8217;s hit comedy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weeds,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seven seasons of Showtime&#8217;s acclaimed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nurse Jackie,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and six seasons of USA&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead Zone. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had great success with projects that other people would not do,&#8221; Beggs said. &#8220;I would not want to be known as the company that passed on something like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mad Men </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weeds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beggs has received Operation Smile&#8217;s John Connor Humanitarian Award, the Help Group&#8217;s Teddy Bear Humanitarian Award, and the Broadcasting &amp; Cable 2014 Innovation Award. Last October, he was inducted into the Broadcasting &amp; Cable Hall of Fame. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout his rise, Beggs has maintained strong connections to his alma mater. &#8220;The term &#8216;critical thinking&#8217; is thrown around loosely, but UC Santa Cruz really pushes that,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While theater arts was a &#8220;creative immersion,&#8221; his politics classes &#8220;really threw out every assumption you ever had about any kind of topic. There was an almost aggressive kind of debunking. You don&#8217;t just turn that off when you leave college.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8039779d80727017273daba40f999a93"><name>year-of-alumni-perry-kris</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Kris Perry: Standing for equality</title><summary>Kris Perry never intended to become a civil rights icon.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kris Perry never intended to become a civil rights icon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, she explored the themes of social justice that would shape her career as an advocate for children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After more than two decades of behind-the-scenes work, Perry stepped into the national spotlight in 2009 as the lead plaintiff in the historic legal challenge that overturned California's ban on gay marriage. Perry says she was simply doing what was right and advocating for her family when she joined the case that took marriage equality all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry's life story could have been a case study in one of the classes she took as an undergraduate. More than 30 years later, she still raves about her professors and their ability to link the personal to the political. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I woke up politically at Santa Cruz," she says. She discovered feminism&#8212;and her sexual orientation. She came out, and she began to explore gender equality and civil rights. &#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry began her career as a child-abuse investigator and spent nearly 25 years as a social worker and director of social service programs. In 2005, she was named executive director of First 5 California. Seven years later, she moved to Washington, D.C., as executive director of the First Five Years Fund, a national bipartisan advocacy group that supports the education and care needs of low-income children from birth through age 5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last May, she and her wife, Sandy Stier, published their memoir, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love on Trial: Our Supreme Court Fight for the Right to Marry.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in June, they celebrated the graduation of their son, Elliott (Rachel Carson &#8216;17, environmental studies), who followed in his mom&#8217;s footsteps and became a Slug. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="803e966b80727017273daba45c05edc6"><name>year-of-alumni-sanjayan-m</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>M.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A prominent ecologist and Emmy-nominated television personality, M. Sanjayan is CEO of the nonprofit Conservation International&#8212;the first new CEO of the organization in 30 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A charismatic, knowledgeable media presence, he has hosted and cohosted documentaries for PBS, BBC, Discovery, and Showtime. He was cohost for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Blue Live, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and as host of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earth: A New Wild,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he traveled all over the world, contemplating watersheds, studying snails, shadowing sharks, living with Sami reindeer herders, and cozying up to panda bears</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> His peer-reviewed scientific work has been published in journals including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science, Nature,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservation Biology.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Conservation International, he pioneered the use of media to increase understanding of the planet&#8217;s most precious resources, with projects such as </span><a href="http://natureisspeaking.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature Is Speaking </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.conservation.org/stories/vr/pages/valens-reef.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valen&#8217;s Reef.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He also hosts </span><a href="https://www.conservation.org/NewsRoom/pressreleases/Pages/University-of-California-and-Vox-Media%E2%80%99s-Climate-Lab-Series-Features-Conservation-International-CEO-Dr.-M.-Sanjayan.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an innovative series on global climate change produced by the University of California; the program has 12 million views and counting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sri Lankan&#8211;born Sanjayan attributes much of his confidence and analytical thinking to his years on campus. "While I was at UC Santa Cruz I didn't think much about conservation," he said. "I mostly thought about taking on difficult questions." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sees his roles as a conservationist and a broadcaster as deeply intertwined, giving him the ability to address complex topics in ways that a lay audience can understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It has to have this personal relevance to what impacts people's lives today," he said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8041889c80727017273daba4596c7434"><name>year-of-alumni-barnes-adilah</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Adilah Barnes: Holding the stage</title><summary>An award-winning actor with over 50 years of film, television, and stage credits, Adilah Barnes is probably best known to television audiences for her role as Anne Marie on ABC's Roseanne for six seasons.</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Adilah Barnes: Holding the stage</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-barnes-adilah</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-barnes-adilah</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1513980266624</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518822909928</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/barnes.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/barnes.gif</link><site>news</site><name>barnes.gif</name><display-name>barnes.gif</display-name><file-size>47436</file-size><width>400</width><height>711</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Cowell ’72, individual major in black theater, Theater Arts Department
</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;">An award-winning actor with over 50 years of film, television, and stage credits, Adilah Barnes is probably best known to television audiences for her role as Anne Marie on ABC's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseanne</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for six seasons. Recent TV appearances include ABC's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Middle,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> NBC&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry&#8217;s Law</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Suspect,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CBS's </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold Case. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She will also appear in the upcoming 2018 revival of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseanne</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sit-com after a 20-year hiatus. Her film credits include the blockbuster award-winning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Brockovich</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murder by Numbers.</span></i><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes cofounded the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival, an annual multicultural solo festival now in its 25th year, and founded the Writers Well international literary retreat for women in Sharpsburg, Georgia. Barnes has also toured 40 states and three continents (including North America, Africa, and Europe) with her one-woman play, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Am That I Am: Woman, Black.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Her first book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On My Own Terms, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was published in 2008 and ranked number three in June 2009 on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazine best-seller list (just behind two books by President Barack Obama).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among numerous awards over the years, in 2010 Barnes was named one of UC Santa Cruz's Most Influential Alumni and was recipient of the Winona Fletcher Award for Outstanding Achievement and Artistic Excellence in Theatre. In that same year, she was also honored with the establishment of the Adilah Barnes Arts and Literary Achievement Scholarship for inner-city youth in Minneapolis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Barnes was the first African American woman inducted into the Hall of Fame in her hometown of Oroville, Calif., and in 2017 she was honored, along with the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival, at the Inner City Cultural Center's 50th anniversary in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I have simply followed my callings over the years, and I acknowledge UC Santa Cruz for being a major turning point in my life and my career in entertainment,&#8221; says Barnes. &#8220;I was there during my coming of age, and the campus gave me the opportunity to stretch my wings and soar."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8044067180727017273daba4d9d58c16"><name>year-of-alumni-mendoza-martha</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Martha Mendoza: Writing wrongs</title><summary>Two-time Pulitzer Prize–winning Associated Press reporter and author Martha Mendoza had a life-changing moment early in her UC Santa Cruz career.</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Martha Mendoza: Writing wrongs</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-mendoza-martha</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-mendoza-martha</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1513980429913</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518823172696</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/mendoza.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/mendoza.gif</link><site>news</site><name>mendoza.gif</name><display-name>mendoza.gif</display-name><file-size>40173</file-size><width>400</width><height>571</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Kresge '88, individual major, journalism and education
</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two-time Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning Associated Press reporter and author Martha Mendoza had a life-changing moment early in her UC Santa Cruz career.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My pivot moment came when I landed in Conn Hallinan's journalism class," she said. "He was lively and engaging, and as angry as I was about the wrongs of the world. For the first time, I saw work I could do that had real meaning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendoza had just spent her summer traveling in Central America. She returned to America with roiling emotions, and full of hard questions. &#8220;Our military was getting involved in civil wars and domestic issues, going well beyond humanitarian aid. Who was accountable? Was this a clear mission?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the journalism class, she found her power for the first time, allowing her to break through that initial feeling of frustration and helplessness. &#8220;Conn told me 30 years ago that I had 'enormous potential as a professional journalist,&#8217;&#8221; Mendoza said. &#8220;No one had ever said anything like that to me. I believed him, and still work to live up to his belief in me."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2000, Mendoza and two fellow AP reporters won the Pulitzer for revealing, with extensive documentation, the decades-old secret of how American soldiers early in the Korean War killed hundreds of Korean civilians in a massacre at the No Gun Ri Bridge.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, she was part of a reporting team that exposed the use of slave labor in the Thai seafood industry. The reporting, </span><a href="https://www.ap.org/explore/seafood-from-slaves/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seafood From Slaves,</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traced slave-produced seafood from Asia to major U.S. supermarkets, restaurants, and food suppliers, and resulted in the freeing of 2,000 slaves. The AP won the Pulitzer for public service&#8212;a first for the 170-year-old news agency.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8055c64c80727017273daba42adb5459"><name>year-of-alumni-grande-reyna</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reyna Grande: Documenting the immigrant experience</title><summary>Award-winning novelist and memoirist Reyna Grande attended UC Santa Cruz after her junior college English teacher urged her to leave the urban confines of Los Angeles and try living somewhere different.</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Reyna Grande: Documenting the immigrant experience</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-grande-reyna</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-grande-reyna</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1513981593088</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518823034899</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/grande.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/grande.gif</link><site>news</site><name>grande.gif</name><display-name>grande.gif</display-name><file-size>40744</file-size><width>400</width><height>511</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Kresge '99, creative writing, film and video
</article-subhead><article-text>Award-winning novelist and memoirist Reyna Grande attended UC Santa Cruz after her junior college English teacher urged her to leave the urban confines of Los Angeles and try living somewhere different. <br/><br/>Initially, it was a shock to find herself among the redwoods, and in a demographic minority, having moved to the rural campus from Highland Park, a predominantly Latino neighborhood in northeast Los Angeles. <br/><br/>But she soon found her artistic voice in creative writing classes, and her political identity while attending a rally to protest Proposition 209, which abolished California's affirmative action program.<br/><br/>&#8220;That day I suddenly didn't feel alone anymore, seeing all those Latino students,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had more confidence in myself. I was more determined than ever to get a college education and really make a difference in my family, my Latino community, and my country."<br/>In 2007, she received an American Book award for her debut novel, Across a Hundred Mountains. She wrote the first 80 pages of the novel&#8212;a poignant story about immigration and family based on her own personal experience&#8212;as part of her senior project in the Literature Department.<br/><br/>Her second novel, Dancing with Butterflies, received a 2010 International Latino Book Award.<br/><br/>In 2012, she was a finalist for the prestigious National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2015 she was honored with a Luis Leal Award for Distinction in Chicano/Latino Literature. Her works have been published internationally.<br/><br/>The Los Angeles Times called her memoir The Distance Between Us &#8220;a brutally honest book &#8230; the Angela&#8217;s Ashes of the modern Mexican immigrant experience.&#8221; <br/><br/>And The Washington Independent Review of Books observed, &#8220;This book would be fabulous required reading for college freshmen&#8212;or even better, for freshman members of Congress.&#8221;<br/><br/>The Distance Between Us was released as a young readers edition in 2016. Her new memoir, A Dream Called Home, will be released in fall 2018. Part of the story takes place in Santa Cruz.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="80608d2280727017273daba4a8abaf2a"><name>year-of-alumni-weil-sage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sage Weil: Opening doors for open source</title><summary>As the founder of web hosting company DreamHost, Sage Weil was already a successful entrepreneur when he came to UC Santa Cruz in 2004 to study data storage systems.</summary><start-date>1514793600000</start-date><display-name>Sage Weil: Opening doors for open source</display-name><path>/2018/01/year-of-alumni-weil-sage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/year-of-alumni-weil-sage</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1513982299330</created-on><last-modified-by>lnwhite</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518823463292</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/weil.gif</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/weil.gif</link><site>news</site><name>weil.gif</name><display-name>weil.gif</display-name><file-size>38328</file-size><width>400</width><height>694</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Ph.D. '07, computer science</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the founder of web hosting company DreamHost, Sage Weil was already a successful entrepreneur when he came to UC Santa Cruz in 2004 to study data storage systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceph, initially developed by Weil and other students and faculty in UC Santa Cruz's Baskin School of Engineering, is an open source, software-defined storage system that runs on commodity hardware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning his Ph.D., Weil continued to work on Ceph with a small team at DreamHost, then founded the spin-off Inktank to further develop the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inktank was acquired by open source software provider Red Hat in 2014 for $175 million. Weil now works for Red Hat as the chief architect of the Ceph project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, Weil made major gifts to UC Santa Cruz providing a total of $3 million to support research in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">free and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open source software. His gift established a $1 million endowment at UC Santa Cruz for the Sage Weil Presidential Chair for Open Source Software.

She later joined Google in 1999 as the company's first marketing manager and employee number 16. &#160;<br/><br/>In 2002, Susan began working on Google&#8217;s advertising products and over the next 12 years she led teams that helped define the vision and direction of Google&#8217;s monetization platforms. During that time she was also instrumental in two of Google&#8217;s largest acquisitions&#8212;the $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube in 2006 and the $3.1 billion purchase of DoubleClick in 2007.<br/><br/>In 2015, Wojcicki was named to <em>Time</em>'s 100 most influential people and described in a later issue of <em>Time</em> as &#8220;the most powerful woman on the internet.&#8221;<br/><br/>In 2017, <em>Forbes</em> ranked Wojcicki No. 6 on its list of "The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.&#8221; <br/><br/>Even as she racks up the career successes, Wojcicki says her days at UC Santa Cruz seem like yesterday.<br/><br/>&#8220;I feel like it&#8217;s not that long ago that I was a UC Santa Cruz student on a scholarship,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t changed that much since then&#8212;but the world has changed. When I graduated in 1993, the internet was still a government research project.&#8221;<br/><br/>Today, the internet has more than 3 billion users across the globe, and over 1.5 billion logged-in viewers visit the site that Wojcicki runs&#8212;YouTube&#8212;every single month.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/</url><title>Year of Alumni</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="995cb5e680727017273daba4e027e7f3"><name>supermassive-black-holes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supermassive black holes control star formation in large galaxies</title><summary>Astronomers found a close correlation between the mass of a galaxy's central black hole and its star formation history.</summary><keywords>Jean Brodie, Ignacio Martin-Navarro</keywords><start-date>1514822400000</start-date><display-name>Supermassive black holes control star formation in large galaxies</display-name><path>/2018/01/supermassive-black-holes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/supermassive-black-holes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1514401477023</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1514822143235</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/centaurus-a-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/centaurus-a-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>centaurus-a-410.jpg</name><display-name>centaurus-a-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>115332</file-size><width>410</width><height>398</height></image><image-alt>Centaurus A</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/centaurus-a-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/centaurus-a-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>centaurus-a-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>centaurus-a-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20440</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Centaurus A</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The power of a supermassive black hole is seen in this image of Centaurus A, one of the active galactic nuclei closest to Earth.

A new study, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24999">published January 1, 2018, in <em>Nature</em></a>, shows that the mass of the black hole in the center of the galaxy determines how soon this "quenching" of star formation occurs.</p>
<p>Every massive galaxy has a central supermassive black hole, more than a million times more massive than the sun, revealing its presence through its gravitational effects on the galaxy's stars and sometimes powering the energetic radiation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The energy pouring into a galaxy from an active galactic nucleus is thought to turn off star formation by heating and dispelling the gas that would otherwise condense into stars as it cooled.</p>
<p>This idea has been around for decades, and astrophysicists have found that simulations of galaxy evolution must incorporate feedback from the black hole in order to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies. But observational evidence of a connection between supermassive black holes and star formation has been lacking, until now.</p>
<p>"We've been dialing in the feedback to make the simulations work out, without really knowing how it happens," said Jean Brodie, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and a coauthor of the paper. "This is the first direct observational evidence where we can see the effect of the black hole on the star formation history of the galaxy."</p>
<p>The new results reveal a continuous interplay between black hole activity and star formation throughout a galaxy's life, affecting every generation of stars formed as the galaxy evolves.</p>
<p>Led by first author Ignacio Mart&#237;n-Navarro, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz, the study focused on massive galaxies for which the mass of the central black hole had been measured in previous studies by analyzing the motions of stars near the center of the galaxy. To determine the star formation histories of the galaxies, Mart&#237;n-Navarro analyzed detailed spectra of their light obtained by the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Massive Galaxy Survey.</p>
<p>Spectroscopy enables astronomers to separate and measure the different wavelengths of light from an object. Mart&#237;n-Navarro used computational techniques to analyze the spectrum of each galaxy and recover its star formation history by finding the best combination of stellar populations to fit the spectroscopic data. "It tells you how much light is coming from stellar populations of different ages," he said.</p>
<p>When he compared the star formation histories of galaxies with black holes of different masses, he found striking differences. These differences only correlated with black hole mass and not with galactic morphology, size, or other properties.</p>
<p>"For galaxies with the same mass of stars but different black hole mass in the center, those galaxies with bigger black holes were quenched earlier and faster than those with smaller black holes. So star formation lasted longer in those galaxies with smaller central black holes," Mart&#237;n-Navarro said.</p>
<p>Other researchers have looked for correlations between star formation and the luminosity of active galactic nuclei, without success. Mart&#237;n-Navarro said that may be because the time scales are so different, with star formation occurring over hundreds of millions of years, while outbursts from active galactic nuclei occur over shorter periods of time.</p>
<p>A supermassive black hole is only luminous when it is actively gobbling up matter from its host galaxy's inner regions. Active galactic nuclei are highly variable and their properties depend on the size of the black hole, the rate of accretion of new material falling onto the black hole, and other factors.</p>
<p>"We used black hole mass as a proxy for the energy put into the galaxy by the AGN, because accretion onto more massive black holes leads to more energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei, which would quench star formation faster," Mart&#237;n-Navarro explained.</p>
<p>The precise nature of the feedback from the black hole that quenches star formation remains uncertain, according to coauthor Aaron Romanowsky, an astronomer at San Jose State University and UC Observatories.</p>
<p>"There are different ways a black hole can put energy out into the galaxy, and theorists have all kinds of ideas about how quenching happens, but there's more work to be done to fit these new observations into the models," Romanowsky said.</p>
<p>In addition to Mart&#237;n-Navarro, Brodie, and Romanowsky, the coauthors of the paper include Tom&#225;s Ruiz Lara at the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands in Tenerife, Spain, and Glenn van de Ven at UC Observatories and the European Southern Observatory. This research was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, and the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bd4ad39d80727017273daba4a3eb961a"><name>nsf-icorps</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NSF I-Corps pushes discoveries to market</title><summary>Professor Sue Carter testified before congressional leaders on NSF Innovation Corps, which assists scientists and engineers in discovering commercial applications for their research.&#13;

<p>Professor <a href="https://sacarter.soe.ucsc.edu">Sue Carter</a> offered testimony on NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which assists scientists and engineers in discovering commercial applications for their research. Carter appeared before the United States House <a href="https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-lab-market-review-nsf-innovation">Committee on Science, Space and Technology</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strength of the NSF I-Corps program is that it pushes researchers out of the lab and into the community to talk to potential customers, enabling them to better understand the societal value or lack thereof that their research has,&#8221; Carter said during the December 5 hearing in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>I-Corps was created and funded by the National Science Foundation&#8212;a federal agency tasked with supporting scientific and engineering research&#8212;in 2011. The program came after the discovery that scientists were experiencing difficulty in transforming the products of their research into something the general public could use.</p>
<p>&#8220;University scientists believed that just having innovative technology was enough to make a successful business,&#8221; said Steve Blank, who helped write the curriculum for the I-Corps program and also testified to federal leaders. &#8220;The reality is that&#8217;s wrong. They needed to figure out how to turn their innovations in the lab into products that people want to buy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program&#8217;s creators wanted to unleash the transformative potential of cutting-edge scientific research with the goal of bringing to market innovations in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and more.</p>
<p>I-Corps is comprised of eight regional hubs, or &#8220;nodes&#8221; as they are called, and has already graduated hundreds of teams of researchers who have attended classes held at 86 universities around the country.</p>
<p>Carter was called to testify because of her unique insight as a scientist, researcher, and entrepreneur. Along with having been a three-time participant in the program as a team member, she also runs the site at UC Santa Cruz, allowing her to provide insight as both a student and a teacher.</p>
<p>Having been involved in two solar technology companies before her encounter with I-Corps, Carter told lawmakers the program would have been indispensable in helping her and her associates engage with potential customers and identify what aspects of their breakthrough were useful to the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had the experience of the NSF I-Corps program, I am confident we would have come to the correct product decision two years earlier,&#8221; Carter said of her second experience at a company called Solexant, which focused on developing a thin-film solar cell.</p>
<p>Instead, the company pivoted later to a new technology, enabling China to garner a larger market share in the thin-film solar industry, she said.</p>
<p>Since going through I-Corps, Carter succeeded with the research-to-market transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two companies started after NSF I-Corps resulted in us being able to sell a commercial product to customers with much less time and funding,&#8221; Carter said.</p>
<p>The professor added this concept is broadly applicable, particularly since so much scientific research is funded by the federal government through grants.</p>
<p>In this context, I-Corps provides a useful tool in ensuring taxpayer money is used more efficiently with a greater potential for beneficial social impact, she said. The program also benefits undergraduate and graduate students, Carter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While only a few of the students going through the program actually start companies, the training has proven invaluable to students as they seek employment after they graduate,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Understanding how to listen to your customers and make changes to your product to fulfill their needs is important in any job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Illinois Congressman Dan Lipinski asked if the program could be a catalyst for rejuvenation in economically depressed areas.</p>
<p>Carter said UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s standing as a Hispanic Serving Institution and its proximity to economically depressed areas like the Salinas Valley mean its version of the program served the underprivileged.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of first generation students in our program,&#8221; Carter said, adding that in terms of diversity, I-Corps outstrips the more typical university science and engineering classes. &#8220;The students who don&#8217;t come from privileged backgrounds realize how important it is for them to learn entrepreneurial skills and be able to create their own jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite lingering concerns from some on Capitol Hill about the funding of science programs in general, the lawmakers seemed enthusiastic about the program&#8217;s present and future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seven years in and the program has not just grown and expanded NSF, but it&#8217;s been adopted and adapted by several other agencies,&#8221; Lipinski said. &#8220;We are seeing exactly the kind of outcome we had hoped for.&#8221;</p>
<p>While many of the program&#8217;s alumni, including Carter, have brought successful products to market as a result of I-Corps, just as important is the fact that people are able to fail quicker rather than wasting years and resources in trying to develop commercial applications no one needs or wants.</p>
<p>Carter said I-Corps could be expanded to include lessons on how to talk to venture capitalists, the legal context for startups and their product, and expanding the training to entrepreneurs outside the scope of students, faculty, and mentors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;d be willing to pay for the course,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know I would&#8217;ve been.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bd55f1e680727017273daba46a471678"><name>vendor-curriculum-management</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New vendor selected for curriculum management</title><summary>The Curriculum Management Project, a campuswide initiative to improve the systems used to manage curriculum at UC Santa Cruz, is pleased to announce SmartCatalog has been selected as the vendor for phase one of the project.</summary><start-date>1514966400000</start-date><display-name>Curriculum management</display-name><path>/2018/01/vendor-curriculum-management</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/vendor-curriculum-management</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1515005013382</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1515005013382</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Curriculum Management Project, a campuswide initiative to improve the systems used to manage curriculum at UC Santa Cruz, is pleased to announce SmartCatalog has been selected as the vendor for phase one of the project.</p>

<p>Summer session 2018 courses and descriptions are now available at <a href="http://summer.ucsc.edu">summer.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s helpful for students to know now that summer can be part of their planning for winter, spring, and next fall,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of the Summer Session Office. &#8220;Last summer, more than 4,500 students used summer to make real progress, complete a minor, or take very small upper division classes to work closely with faculty.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to offering high-demand courses, this summer features numerous experiential and service learning opportunities, including Kresge Garden Co-op and Grant Writing. New faculty-led summer abroad courses are availabe such as <em>Law and Politics</em> in Berlin and Prague, <em>Printmaking</em> in Tokyo, and <em>Anthropological Food Study</em> in Italy. Thirty departments are offering more than 250 on-campus courses, ranging from economics to ecosystems, and eukaryotic lab to the Entrepreneurship Academy.</p>
<p>This year, there are 32 online courses, up from 20 last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand staying in Santa Cruz is not an option for all students. By expanding our online offerings, students can return home and work, but still make degree progress year round,&#8221; Parikh said.</p>
<p>All students (in-state and out-of-state) pay the same summer tuition rate of $281 per credit. Financial aid is available for eligible students through state and federal loans, summer Pell, and the University Grant. On-campus housing is available at discounted rates.</p>
<p>Enrollment opens to all students on May 1. Most courses are five weeks, with a few 8- and 10-week classes, such as engineering and physics.</p>

<p>Sam was a first year Stevenson student who was also a member of the UCSC rugby team. Sam's family wrote that he would be remembered for his smile, his sense of humor, his love for rugby, and his zany socks. The family is working with Bishop O'Dowd to establish a rugby fund in Sam's honor.&#160;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of music David Dunn has been selected for a Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship for 2019.</p>
<p>He is one of four local artists who will receive $20,000 grants from the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County in 2018-19.</p>
<p>The fellowships are awarded solely on artistic merit by a panel of arts professionals from outside the Santa Cruz area. They help individual artists pursue their creative work and are not tied to the completion of any specific project.</p>
<p>Developed with input from the local arts community, the awards were created to honor the wishes of Roy and Frances Rydell, both lifelong advocates of the arts. They established the Rydell Visual Arts Fund at the foundation in 1985 to promote Santa Cruz County artists and arts organizations.</p>
<p>After their passing, the Rydell&#8217;s estate was bequeathed to the Community Foundation, with the proceeds of the sale added to the fund, which has since grown to more than $2.4 million. The fund is used to support the arts through grants to visual arts organizations and fellowships to individual artists.</p>
<p>Dunn&#8217;s research and practice cross the boundaries between sound, performance, media arts and bioacoustics research. Last year, he<em><strong> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/bark-beetles-dunn.html">received a patent</a></strong></em> in collaboration with two forest scientists from Northern Arizona University to help fight a bark beetle infestation that is killing millions of trees in Western forests.</p>
<p>Dunn holds an M.F.A. in New Media from Danube University, Austria, and is a core faculty member in the UC Santa Cruz Digital Arts and New Media graduate program.</p>
<p>His recent work has been exhibited at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History; Artpark Lewiston, NY; Art Center, Miami; The Lab, San Francisco; Gallery of Fine Arts Ostrava, Slovakia; and frieraum quartier 21, Vienna.</p>
<p>Dunn is also the author and editor of six books and has contributed to more than 100 academic and arts publications. He has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Ford Foundation, The Foundation for Contemporary Arts, two from the Henry Langlois Foundation, three from the Rockefeller Foundation, and an Alpert Award.</p>
<p>In addition to Dunn, the three other new 2018-19 Rydell fellowship recipients include two UC Santa Cruz alumni--<strong><a href="http://myraeastman.com/">Myra Eastman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.robertchiarito.com/">Robert Chiarito</a></strong>--along with intermedia artist Robin Kandel.</p>
<p>Eastman, who received her B.A. in art from the campus in 1977, is a painter whose works engage with political and social change issues such as war, occupation, neighborhood chaos, and gun violence. She has shown in solo exhibits at Museo Eduardo Carrillo; the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History; Felix Kulpa; Gallerie Lumiere, Savannah, GA; and the San Francisco Public Library.</p>
<p>Eastman has also participated in group shows at venues including the Petaluma Arts Center; bG Gallery, Santa Monica; San Diego Art Institute; Mint Gallery, Atlanta; Phoenix Gallery, New York; and OnSite Brooklyn. A recently retired public school educator, she taught elementary and middle school students for more than three decades in Santa Cruz County.&#160;</p>
<p>Chiarito earned his B.A. from UC Santa Cruz in 1970 and an M.F.A. from Stanford University. Currently a professor of art at San Jose State University, he is a painter whose work has received solo exhibitions at the Triton Museum; Stanford Art Gallery; Galleria Jose Maria Velasco, Mexico City; Ahknaton Gallery, Cairo, Egypt; Casa de la Cultura Tlalpan, Mexico City; and Ovsey Gallery, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Chiarito has also received commissions to create public work for the Oakland City Center, Bramalea Pacific/Cafe Fontebella, and the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union. His paintings are held in private collections throughout North America and Europe, as well as Lloyds of London, Los Angeles, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roy and Frances Rydell would be proud to see how their support is making a difference for local artists,&#8221; noted program director Christina Cuevas. "It was the Rydells&#8217; intent that the visual arts would be supported in perpetuity and that&#8217;s what the fund is doing. It is a permanent legacy that benefits everyone in Santa Cruz County.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/bark-beetles-dunn.html</url><title>Music professor receives patent to help fight bark beetles ravaging Western forests</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=a0X9rhHH2Zg</url><title>Watch video about David Dunn's bark beetle patent</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7fca74e80727017273daba4546799b3"><name>protect-yourself-flu</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Protect yourself as influenza spreads in Santa Cruz</title><summary>If you have not had your flu shot it is not too late!

<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p class="gmail-MsoNormal"><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Influenza is an illness which causes the abrupt onset of very high fever, all over body aches and fatigue.<span>&#160; </span>Sometimes it also causes cold symptoms but the most common symptoms are high fever and a dry cough.<span>&#160; </span>Typically the fever lasts 3 to 7 days.<span>&#160; </span>The dry cough and fatigue can persist for several weeks.<span>&#160; </span></span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p class="gmail-MsoNormal"><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The best way to protect yourself is to get a flu shot.<span>&#160; </span>Flu shots are available for students at the Student Health Center and for faculty and staff at your health care provider&#8217;s office or at most pharmacies.<span>&#160; </span>We know that this year the flu shot is not completely effective at preventing the strain of flu.

Using genetics, biologists involved in the <a href="https://www.birdgenoscape.org/">Bird Genoscape Project</a> are racing against time to find out the potential for adaptation and how best to protect vulnerable populations of birds.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s most recent study, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6371/83">published in <em>Science</em></a>, focuses on the yellow warbler. Found across most of North America, the bird spends its winters in Central and South America, and flies as far north as Alaska and the Arctic Circle in the summer, filling wildlands and backyards with color and song along the way.</p>
<p>Using more than 200 blood, tissue and feather samples from across the breeding range, the researchers discovered genes that appear to be responding to climate, and found that bird populations that most need to adapt to climate change are experiencing declines.</p>
<p>Senior author Kristen Ruegg, a research scientist at UC Santa Cruz and adjunct assistant professor at UCLA, said previous studies focused on how long-term changes in temperature and precipitation cause bird species to shift their geographic ranges. Genetic mapping offers the opportunity to look at another option&#8212;the capacity to adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this research, we can say, based on these gene-environment correlations, here&#8217;s how populations will have to adapt to future climate change, and here are the populations that have to adapt most,&#8221; said Ruegg, who also is co-director of the Bird Genoscape Project.</p>
<p>Whether the yellow warbler will be able to adapt is another matter. &#8220;That&#8217;s our next big question,&#8221; Ruegg said.</p>
<p><strong>Valuable information for conservationists</strong></p>
<p>The new study uncovered some of the challenges yellow warblers already face. In some populations, genes associated with climate adaptation are mismatched to environments. These populations will likely have the hardest time adapting quickly enough to future climate shifts.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s been the case in the past, too. Comparing the genetic findings to breeding bird surveys dating back to the 1960s that track changes in bird abundance, the researchers determined that the populations that need to adapt most are already in decline. Using genetic maps, the habitats of the populations most vulnerable to climate change can now be targeted for protection, said Rachael Bay, lead author of the study and a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow. The findings offer valuable information for conservationists who hope to protect species like the yellow warbler in the future, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evolution has the potential to matter a lot when it comes to climate change response,&#8221; Bay said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a process we should start to integrate more when we make decisions, and it&#8217;s shown a lot of promise that hasn&#8217;t been realized yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The yellow warbler is not currently endangered. It was selected for the study to give researchers a better understanding of how genes relate to climate variables across its broad range. But the bird may serve as a canary in the coal mine for species that are more at risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an alarm bell,&#8221; said Tom Smith, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCLA and director of the Center for Tropical Research. &#8220;We spend a lot of time asking what is going to happen under climate change, what the effects will be and what we need to do to manage it. Our results shocked us&#8212;it&#8217;s happening now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study sets the stage for two important next steps, Smith said. First, it means additional studies need to be done to learn how other species adapt to climate change. Second, the findings can be used now to tailor and inform future conservation management.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d7c4d80f80727017273daba4e934f658"><name>breakthrough-of-the-year</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Neutron star merger observations hailed as scientific breakthrough of the year</title><summary>Both Science and Physics World noted the significance of the findings in which UC Santa Cruz astronomers played a key role.</summary><keywords>Ryan Foley</keywords><start-date>1515398400000</start-date><display-name>Neutron star merger observations hailed as scientific breakthrough of the year</display-name><path>/2018/01/breakthrough-of-the-year</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/breakthrough-of-the-year</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1515448488841</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1515450372035</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/ryan-foley-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/ryan-foley-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ryan-foley-350.jpg</name><display-name>ryan-foley-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>110635</file-size><width>350</width><height>372</height></image><image-alt>Ryan Foley</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/ryan-foley-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/ryan-foley-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ryan-foley-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ryan-foley-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27082</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ryan Foley</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Astronomer Ryan Foley led the team that made the first observations of a visible event linked to the detection of gravitational waves.

<p>Gravitational waves from the cataclysmic merger of two neutron stars were detected in August by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and astronomers around the world then raced to find the source and observe the light from the merger. A small team led by Ryan Foley, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, located the source and captured the first images and spectra of the merger with telescopes at the Carnegie Institution's Las Campanas Observatory in Chile (see <a href="http://reports.news.ucsc.edu/neutron-star-merger/">Special Report: "Neutron stars, gravitational waves, and all the gold in the universe"</a>).</p>
<p>An <a href="http://vis.sciencemag.org/breakthrough2017/">article in <em>Science</em></a> about the breakthrough noted: "The blast confirmed several key astrophysical models, revealed a birthplace of many heavy elements, and tested the general theory of relativity as never before. That first observation of a neutron-star merger, and the scientific bounty it revealed, is <em>Science's</em> 2017 Breakthrough of the Year."</p>

Santa Cruz may be nestled in the redwoods, but the students who study here travel far and wide after graduation, bringing with them the values, experiences, and reputation of our campus.</p>
<p>Our 120,000 alumni live throughout California, the nation, and the world. The largest clusters are in the greater Bay Area and Los Angeles area, along with 22,000 in Santa Cruz County. And they can be found in every field&#8212;from science to government to entertainment, frequently adding an element of social justice to their pursuits.</p>
<p>As a way to honor all their achievements and the 50th anniversary of the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association, the campus is marking 2018 as the <a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/">"Year of Alumni."</a></p>
<p>This year-long celebration is intended to honor the accomplishments of UC Santa Cruz alumni and involve them with the campus in new ways and greater numbers.</p>
<p>Look for the new banners featuring 13 prominent alumni along main campus roads and in Quarry Plaza. The choices were difficult. These Slugs represent just a small sample of all alumni who have made a difference.</p>
<p><em>Tuesday Newsday</em> will regularly feature alumni with stories about what they&#8217;ve accomplished and what&#8217;s next for them.</p>
<p>And, most importantly, we&#8217;ll continue to meet alumni where they live to strengthen their connection to campus. Last year, we hosted more than 100 alumni engagement events&#8212;some as far away as New York and Washington, DC. We hope to do even more this coming year.</p>
<p>I hope you all will look for ways to incorporate the &#8220;Year of Alumni&#8221; into your events and efforts, and remember that today&#8217;s students are tomorrow&#8217;s alumni. Personal connections&#8212;an influential professor or a supportive staff member&#8212;often make the most lasting memories. We all play a role in helping build and maintain a passionate and loyal alumni base.</p>
<p>In addition to being living examples of a UC Santa Cruz education, our alumni are vital for many more reasons.</p>
<p>First, they help to inspire student interest in our campus. We recorded record applications&#8212;more than 67,000&#8212;for fall 2018. Prospective students take note when they learn about the success of our alumni. We are looking to find even more ways to include alumni in our outreach events.</p>
<p>Alumni can also lend key support in lobbying lawmakers and government officials. Their influence can help ensure the excellence and access of UC continues while also advancing causes we stand for, such as supporting our Dreamers.</p>
<p>The daunting question&#8212;&#8220;What will you do after college?&#8221;&#8212;often can be answered with the help of our alumni who can connect students with internships and job opportunities.</p>
<p>Finally, philanthropy can have a truly transformative impact on a university, as showcased by our recent Campaign for UC Santa Cruz that raised more than $330 million. Alumni were a crucial part of its success and their continued support is integral in supporting our campus mission.</p>
<p>Everyone can join in this effort by connecting with alumni, finding ways to engage them, and ultimately by making sure they realize they are what makes UC Santa Cruz so special.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d82c7d9980727017273daba47e5f0ae9"><name>treehouse-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>State initiative funds UCSC childhood cancer research</title><summary>A $500,000 grant from the California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine supports the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative at the UCSC Genomics Institute.</summary><keywords>David Haussler, Olena Morozova</keywords><start-date>1515398400000</start-date><display-name>State initiative funds UCSC childhood cancer research</display-name><path>/2018/01/treehouse-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/treehouse-grant</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1515455281491</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1515455525892</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Alexis Morgan</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/ckcc-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/ckcc-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ckcc-410.jpg</name><display-name>ckcc-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>90054</file-size><width>410</width><height>302</height></image><image-alt>Ted Goldstein, David Haussler, and Olena Morozova</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/ckcc-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/ckcc-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ckcc-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ckcc-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18483</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>David Haussler and Olena Morozova</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Ted Goldstein, David Haussler, and Olena Morozova (left to right) are involved in the California Kids Cancer Comparison, a project of the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <a href="http://www.ciapm.org/">California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine</a> has awarded a $500,000 grant to the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute to support the <a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</a>. The award supplements previous funding for the Treehouse Initiative&#8217;s work on the <a href="http://www.ciapm.org/project/california-kids-cancer-comparison">California Kids Cancer Comparison</a> (CKCC) project and focuses on a collaboration with Stanford University and Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p>
<p>The Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative is the pediatric cancer research arm of the Genomics Institute and was founded by the institute's scientific director, David Haussler, and postdoctoral researcher Olena Morozova. State funding for this work is supplemented by additional funding from St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation, Unravel Pediatric Cancer, and local philanthropists Rafe and George Kraw, among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;CKCC was a pilot project with ambitious goals for evaluating whether our big data analysis at the Genomics Institute can help kids being treated for cancer right now,&#8221; Haussler said. &#8220;We were able to make a convincing case that it works.&#8221;</p>
<p>With funding for the next stage, called CKCC2, the Treehouse team will conduct a 24-month registry study in collaboration with oncologists at Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital and Stanford Medical Center. This type of study collects and analyzes genomic data from a child&#8217;s cancer tumor and presents the information to the treating clinical oncologist teams. CKCC2 will evaluate the effectiveness of comparative RNA-seq analysis within the clinical process, including tracking patient outcomes and assessing the impact on clinical decision-making and the patient's and family's understanding of and engagement with genomic analysis.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the CKCC2 project, we expect to work closely with Stanford clinical research staff using rigorous data-handling processes, institutionally approved protocols, and consent forms,&#8221; said Isabel Bjork, director of pediatric programs at the Genomics Institute. &#8220;We will have the ability to formally assess the clinical utility of genomic analysis within the clinical environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>In line with Treehouse&#8217;s commitment to providing open access to data, all software the initiative uses is open source. This means that all RNA-seq processed data and accompanying analysis will be made publicly available to benefit researchers. The hope is that by maintaining open access, the Treehouse Initiative can help advance the state of pediatric cancer research.</p>
<p>While Treehouse researchers want to know whether molecular-level tumor activity they identify in the lab drives tumor growth, the team is ultimately concerned with whether genomic analysis could provide a measurable benefit to patients. The project aims to measure &#8220;clinical benefit&#8221; not only in terms of tumor response and symptom control, but also in terms of how patients, their families, and their physicians respond to this tool and use it in their decision-making. Information regarding acceptance of the genomic analysis will be useful in improving education and training during widespread use of genomic-based precision medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the CKCC2 project, we will have a greater ability to evaluate whether Treehouse&#8217;s approach to precision medicine added value to the journey of the patients, their families, and physicians,&#8221; said Haussler.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d84e6cd780727017273daba4221b7aa2"><name>avp-academic-affairs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus appoints new associate vice provost for Academic Affairs</title><summary>After a campuswide search, UC Santa Cruz has appointed Martin Berger to serve as associate vice provost for Academic Affairs.</summary><start-date>1515398400000</start-date><display-name>Academic Affairs</display-name><path>/2018/01/avp-academic-affairs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/avp-academic-affairs</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1515457505456</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1515457505456</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>After a campuswide search, UC Santa Cruz has appointed Martin Berger to serve as associate vice provost for Academic Affairs.</p>
<p>A term appointment through June 2019, Berger will work on four specific high-profile and important projects.</p>
<p>"Professor Berger brings a strong combination of leadership skills, project management experience, and disciplinary knowledge of gender and ethnicity issues. We are excited to have him moving these projects forward, and for the impact they will have for our campus" said Herbert Lee, vice provost for Academic Affairs.</p>
<p>The four projects are helping manage the strategic academic planning effort, co-leading the Beyond Compliance initiative, working with the Academic Personnel Office to complete a comprehensive review of the processes involved with alleged violations of the faculty code of conduct policy; and design and implement a comprehensive training program for department chairs.</p>
<p>Berger will also serve as the associate campus diversity officer for faculty, under the direction of the vice provost for Academic Affairs, and will work in partnership with the campus diversity officer for staff and students to respond to hate-bias reporting and campus climate issues.</p>
<p>Last year, Berger served as acting vice provost for Academic Affairs while Herbert Lee was serving as interim campus provost/executive vice chancellor.</p>
<p>Berger is a professor of history of art/visual culture, studying the interpretation of visual representation of gender and race.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d86ab29d80727017273daba4c2525987"><name>sab-blood-drive</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Advisory Board sponsors blood drive Tuesday, Jan. 30</title><start-date>1515456000000</start-date><display-name>Blood Drive</display-name><path>/2018/01/sab-blood-drive</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/sab-blood-drive</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1515459358309</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1515461282004</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Staff Advisory Board is sponsoring a Red Cross Blood Drive for staff and faculty Tuesday, Jan. 30, 2018 at the Stevenson Event Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>

For many important reasons, it's <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/marijuana-and-drug-policy/">not allowed on campus</a> in any form (nor are tobacco products, but you already knew that).&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>In order to care for yourself and others as recreational marijuana becomes more available, here are the top six things you need to know.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Call 911, <u>without hesitation</u>, if you or someone near you needs help because you suspect overdose and/or are concerned about someone&#8217;s health or well-being. Even if you aren't sure or don't want to get anyone in trouble, please call.<br/></strong><br/><strong>Do NOT just take them back to their room, tuck them into a bed, and leave them alone, as they need to be observed and properly cared for. You could save a life!</strong><br/><br/></li>
<li>Marijuana may seem less dangerous than other drugs, but THC levels (the psychoactive component of marijuana) can vary widely&#8212;and coupling marijuana with other drugs just increases the danger of overdosing or dying. This past fall quarter, we helped provide immediate medical care, including hospitalization, because of the dangerous effects of ingesting high levels of THC.<br/>&#160;</li>
<li>Cannabis can be added to almost any food or drink, including baked goods. It is important to educate yourself about an edible&#8217;s effects, which may last up to 6 to 8 hours, as eating too much THC can be very unpleasant and disorienting. It can cause hallucinations and disorientation, and even "scromiting"&#8212;a combination of vomiting and screaming.&#160;<br/><br/></li>
<li>There are laws about advertising and marketing goods and services on campus (it&#8217;s not always legal), and like all advertisements, they may not always have accurate information about the risks.&#160;<br/>&#160;</li>
<li>Having marijuana on campus means you can still get in trouble&#8212;up to and including dismissal and/or face criminal charges.<br/>&#160;</li>
<li>Educate yourself. It is important for you to understand the information about the signs of overdose, dosage levels, and product labels. Additionally, there are&#160;<a href="https://shop.ucsc.edu/alcohol-other-drugs/marijuana.html">campus resources available</a> to you if you have questions.<br/><br/></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div><strong>SIGNS OF OVERDOSE</strong></div>
<div>An overdose can vary from person to person. However, most people experiencing an overdose present these common symptoms:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Will NOT wake up&#8212;unconscious and unresponsive&#160;</li>
<li>Unable to stand, walk, or have control of their bodily functions&#160;</li>
<li>Uncontrollable vomiting&#160;</li>
<li>Slow/irregular breathing-gurgled sounding&#160;</li>
<li>Pale skin&#160;</li>
<li>Bluish tinge to mouth and fingernails</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>DOSAGE LEVELS</strong></div>
<div>California&#8217;s new regulations require all edibles to clearly indicate THC content and divide edibles into serving sizes of 10 milligrams, with no more than 100 milligrams in a package.&#160; The onset time for feeling the effects from edibles can be up to 2 hours or more. A large concern is for first-time users who over-ingest marijuana because they don&#8217;t understand the dosage levels or have any tolerance with using these drugs.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ON THE PRODUCT LABEL</strong></div>
<div>When purchasing marijuana, especially edibles, look for the THC content listed in milligrams. Avoid products without lab-tested dosage information, as well as items that list their potency in generic terms such as &#8220;extra strength.&#8221;&#160; Ask questions of the dispensary staff about cannabidiol ratios and the contents of what you are about to purchase.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>CAMPUS RESOURCES</strong></div>
<div>If you or someone you care about needs support around overuse of alcohol and/or drugs or would like to learn more about marijuana, alcohol or other drugs, utilize the resources provided through the <a href="https://shop.ucsc.edu">Student Health Outreach and Promotion</a> (SHOP) program in the Cowell Student Health Center. SHOP is a safe, confidential and nonjudgmental space where students can talk about alcohol and other drugs.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>SHOP also provides services for <a href="https://shop.ucsc.edu/students-in-recovery/">students in recovery</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For faculty and staff, assistance is available through the <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a>.</div>

These newborn galaxies, observed as they appeared nearly 13 billion years ago, spin like a whirlpool, similar to our own Milky Way galaxy.</p>
<p>Garth Illingworth, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the international team that made the discovery, explained that light from distant objects takes time to reach Earth, so observing objects that are billions of light years away enables astronomers to look back in time and directly observe the formation of the earliest galaxies.</p>
<p>Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, the team led by Renske Smit at the Kavli Institute of Cosmology, University of Cambridge, identified star-forming galaxies at a very early stage in cosmic history that spin in a way thought not to occur until much later times. The results are reported in the journal <em>Nature</em> and will be presented January 10 at the 231st meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&#8220;ALMA opens up a new window in the spectrum that allows us to measure motions in these early galaxies in a way that has been impossible to date, even with telescopes as powerful as Hubble. This provides new insights into the dramatic activity in these young galaxies as the gas is being transformed into stars,&#8221; Illingworth said.</p>
<p>Smit and her colleagues used ALMA to observe two small newborn galaxies as they existed just 800 million years after the big bang, which was 13.7 billion years ago. By analyzing the spectral &#8216;fingerprint&#8217; of the far-infrared light collected by ALMA, the researchers were able to establish the distance to the galaxies and, for the first time, see the internal motion of the gas that fuelled their growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a remarkable discovery given that the team used ALMA to look back through 94 percent of all time to capture the faint signals from these two galaxies,&#8221; Illingworth said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until ALMA, we&#8217;ve never been able to see the formation of galaxies in such detail, and we&#8217;ve never been able to measure the movement of gas in galaxies so early in the universe&#8217;s history,&#8221; said coauthor Stefano Carniani at Cambridge&#8217;s Cavendish Laboratory and Kavli Institute of Cosmology.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the gas in these newborn galaxies swirled and rotated in a whirlpool motion, similar to our own spiral galaxy and other mature galaxies much later in the universe&#8217;s history. Despite their relatively small size&#8212;about five times smaller than the Milky Way&#8212;these galaxies were forming stars at a higher rate than other young galaxies. But the researchers were surprised to discover that the galaxies were not as chaotic as expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the early Universe, gravity caused gas to flow rapidly into the galaxies, stirring them up and forming lots of new stars. Violent supernova explosions from these stars also makes the gas even more turbulent,&#8221; said Smit, who is a Rubicon Fellow at Cambridge sponsored by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research. &#8220;We expected that young galaxies would be dynamically &#8216;messy&#8217; due to the havoc caused by exploding young stars, but these mini-galaxies show the ability to retain order and appear well regulated. They are already rapidly growing to become one of the &#8216;adult&#8217; galaxies like we live in today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The results from this project pave the way for larger studies of newly-forming galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic time with ALMA&#8217;s uniquely powerful capabilities and with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

Educators across the country are increasingly becoming more active in advocating for policies and laws that support our ability to create a safe campus environment. Chancellor George Blumenthal has joined higher education leaders in numerous <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sites/default/files/Statement-of-Principles-in-Support-of-Undocumented-Members-of-UC.pdf">initiatives</a> to support the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform.</div>

<div>We encourage you to learn more and get involved because these issues directly affect the lives of our students, staff, and their family members. On Aug. 21, 2017, a campuswide message &#8220;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/08/message-supporting-community.html">Supporting Our Community</a>&#8221; was sent out to increase awareness of this issue. The challenges shared in the Sanchez family story remain for millions of students and families across our nation. Learn more about the Sanchez family and please consider signing the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/u-s-senate-urge-congress-to-return-ice-deported-oncology-nurse-maria-mendoza-sanchez-to-u-s-sb1783?recruiter=false&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=share_page&amp;utm_term=triggered">online petition</a> that has been set up to reunite them.&#160;</div>

<p>The evening will feature a conversation with UC Santa Cruz humanities dean <strong>Tyler Stovall</strong> and history of art and visual culture professor <strong>Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez</strong>, moderated by history professor and Humanities Institute director <strong>Nathaniel Deutsch</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>Questions That Matter</em> series is designed to bring together UC Santa Cruz faculty with community residents and students to explore the big questions that matter to everyone. It is part of a strategic initiative of <strong><em><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/about-us/">The Humanities Institute</a></em></strong> (formerly called the Institute for Humanities Research) to champion the role and value of the humanities in contemporary life.</p>
<p>&#8220;We initially made our decision to focus our next event on freedom and race because Dean Stovall is writing a book that explores different aspects of this very timely topic,&#8221; Deutsch noted. &#8220;Since we decided to focus on this theme, current events such as what happened in&#160;Charlottesville, Virginia, have only convinced us more&#160;how important it is to grapple with the subject right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deutsch added that the panelists will discuss the different&#8212;and at times, competing&#8212;understandings of freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freedom has always been a core aspect of America's national identity and, yet, from the very beginning of the country's history, members of different groups have had more or less&#160;freedom depending on their race, gender, or class. How do we grapple with this contradiction?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, universities around&#160;the country are struggling with their commitment to free&#160;speech, on the one hand, and demands&#8212;often from students&#8212;that speakers deemed racist should not be given a campus forum, on the other,&#8221; he added. &#8220;How should universities navigate these competing demands,&#160;especially at such a politically fraught time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dean Stovall noted that his book project is about the intersections of race and liberty in modern history, exploring the ways in which ideas of freedom are racialized.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am writing a study titled <em>White Freedom: the Racial History of an Idea</em>, that takes a broad historical overview of the relationship between race and freedom in the modern era,&#8221; said Stovall.&#160;&#8220;Although the perspective is global, I focus in particular on the histories of France and the United States, not only the two nations I am most familiar with, but also countries for whom the idea of liberty lies at the heart of their national identities.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this study I argue against the notion that racial thinking is a paradox of free peoples, rather than our very ideas of liberty are racialized, shaped by the racial histories of the modern era.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The book is forthcoming from Princeton University Press.&#160;</p>
<p>Deutsch noted that the impact of the The Humanities Institute&#8217;s <em>Questions That Matter</em> series will be enhanced by a recent <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/mellon-humanities-grant.html">$1.5 million grant</a> from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mellon grant has provided us with crucial support to reimagine what the humanities can be at the university by linking our curriculum, research, and training of students with public programming and&#160;community outreach,&#8221; said Deutsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal with this event is to bring experts from&#160;the university to the community to share their perspectives, to encourage a public conversation on a topic that should matter to all of us, and to help attendees come away with a more nuanced perspective on something that has vexed our nation from its founding,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Lindsey Dillon, assistant professor of sociology and the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/03/dillon-data.html">chair of EDGI's steering committee</a>, said this report focused on documenting changes to federal websites pertaining to climate change.</p>
<p>"The Trump administration has overhauled important environmental web pages, removed documents related to climate change, and altered the ways&#160;environmental webpages refer to climate change in a way that obscures or at least significantly downplays the issue," said Dillon, noting that EDGI has not documented the removal of any scientific datasets related to climate change. "We're seeing reduced access to climate change information, especially at the Environmental Protection Agency."</p>
<p>In addition, the report, "<a href="http://100days.envirodatagov.org/changing-digital-climate/#h.2xw1l1cdg70r">Changing the Digital Climate</a>," compares the Trump administration's attack on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to previous administrations, and explores consequences for the regulation of toxic materials and environmental justice. Dillon was the lead author of the section on <a href="http://100days.envirodatagov.org/changing-digital-climate/#kix.forfij38vx58">climate change denial</a>.</p>
<p>The report is based on EDGI's monitoring of tens of thousands of federal environmental websites in an attempt to document changes to the public's access to information, as well as shifting rhetoric.</p>
<p>In one example, the report describes changes made on the White House website since President Trump took office, including the launch of a new site in December 2017 that makes no mention of climate or climate change on its "Energy and Environment" page, in contrast to the White House website under President Obama's administration, which highlighted climate change as a major topic.</p>
<p>EDGI (pronounced "edgy") is an all-volunteer organization of academics, lawyers, archivists, and others who promote open and accessible government data and information in service of evidence-based public policy.</p>
<p>In addition to monitoring federal government websites, EDGI partners with other organizations to archive digital data. One of the recommendations in today's report is that federal agencies should thoroughly document and preserve existing web content before making any changes, and ensure that such material, if significantly altered, remains accessible through a public archive.</p>

<p>Last spring, I brought together a group of campus constituents and members of the greater Santa Cruz community to begin creating our 2020 Long Range Development Plan. These leaders, with input from you and the community as a whole, aim to have a draft of this plan in hand later this year, at which point it will undergo a rigorous environmental review.</p>
<p>An LRDP is like a city&#8217;s general plan. It designates areas of campus for certain types of use: open space, for example, or housing. It does not mandate growth. It simply provides a blueprint for it when it&#8217;s needed and when there&#8217;s funding available. It&#8217;s an extremely effective, proactive planning tool as we look two decades down the road and contemplate how best to educate our future students.</p>
<p>Earlier today I met with a group of community appointees who were convened as part of an advisory group to make sure we gather multiple perspectives on the plan. Hearing different viewpoints is important because the LRDP touches on issues that affect all of us who live and work in this community: water use, traffic, and housing.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, the LRDP is not an OK for enrollment growth. However, we need to have an enrollment target to determine our space and facilities needs. This includes classrooms, lab spaces, housing, student-support services, and other facilities critical to a university experience. The number I have asked the LRDP planners to consider is 28,000 students by 2040. I have no doubt this figure will trigger some conversations, so I want to share with you the reasoning behind my request.</p>
<p>This number does not come out of thin air. It makes sense for a host of reasons.</p>
<p>It walks us out two decades, to the year 2040, using a growth rate of 1.5 to 2 percent a year. That&#8217;s about 400 students annually. This is the rate at which we have been growing. We would see an increase in undergraduates&#8212;with special focus on transfer students&#8212;and, more substantially, those in doctoral and master&#8217;s programs.</p>
<p>The figure has actually been public for nearly 60 years. Roughly 28,000 students has long been the enrollment vision for UC Santa Cruz, outlined in our very first LRDP in 1963, created not too long after the city of Santa Cruz approached UC about building a campus here.</p>
<p>Importantly, I am asking for a strategy of phased investments to accommodate future growth. In other words, there would be no sudden jump from the roughly 18,000 students we accommodate today to 28,000. Growth would be incremental, proceeding only if identified impacts are mitigated. Maybe that will be water use, vehicle trips to campus, or the number of on-campus beds we provide.</p>
<p>I believe this approach will allow us to keep our campus values front and center. Structured correctly, a plan with strong mitigations will allow us to grow larger, while actually reducing our impacts.</p>
<p>Some will question our need to grow at all. I&#8217;d remind them that the University of California is facing unprecedented enrollment pressure. More than 56,000 people &#8212; a new record &#8212; applied to UC Santa Cruz to be first-year students this coming fall. We also saw 11,300 students apply to transfer here from community colleges. We&#8217;re seeing this type of demand systemwide, and it&#8217;s our institutional mission to provide educational opportunity to this state&#8217;s growing, increasingly diverse population. We have an obligation to these students, just as we have served today&#8217;s students and the generations before them.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? Later this month, on Jan. 18, a special interactive LRDP forum for students will take place at 5:30 p.m. at Kresge Town Hall. Interactive forums for faculty and staff took place in November and December. Forums for the broader Santa Cruz community are currently in the works, and details on the events will be published soon on our <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu">LRDP website</a>.</p>
<p>A good plan requires a wide range of input, so please join me in this process. If you have any questions, ideas, or suggestions, feel free to email me at chancellor@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ecce032e8072701755dd2f8d6f3e5036"><name>hydrogen-catalyst</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New catalyst for hydrogen production is a step toward clean fuel </title><summary>A novel material developed at UC Santa Cruz has shown impressive performance as a catalyst for the electrochemical splitting of water to produce hydrogen.</summary><keywords>Shaowei Chen, hydrogen evolution reaction, nanotechnology</keywords><start-date>1516114800000</start-date><display-name>New catalyst for hydrogen production is a step toward clean fuel </display-name><path>/2018/01/hydrogen-catalyst</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/hydrogen-catalyst</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1515801411379</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1516128876071</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/cover-image-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/cover-image-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-410.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>178568</file-size><width>410</width><height>545</height></image><image-alt>cover of journal</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/cover-image-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/cover-image-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-image-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-image-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25550</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image from cover of journal</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The cover image for the January 10 issue of <em>ChemSusChem</em> was designed by UCSC graduate student Yi Peng, first author of a paper on a novel catalyst for hydrogen production.

An efficient, low-cost catalyst is essential for realizing the promise of hydrogen as a clean, environmentally friendly fuel.</p>
<p>Researchers led by Shaowei Chen, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, have been investigating the use of carbon-based nanostructured materials as catalysts for the reaction that generates hydrogen from water. In one recent study, they obtained good results by incorporating ruthenium ions into a sheet-like nanostructure composed of carbon nitride. Performance was further improved by combining the ruthenium-doped carbon nitride with graphene, a sheet-like form of carbon, to form a layered composite.</p>
<p>"The bonding chemistry of ruthenium with nitrogen in these nanostructured materials plays a key role in the high catalytic performance," Chen said. "We also showed that the stability of the catalyst is very good."</p>
<p>The new findings were <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cssc.201701880/abstract">published in <em>ChemSusChem</em></a>, a top journal covering sustainable chemistry and energy materials, and the paper is featured on the cover of the January 10 issue. First author Yi Peng, a graduate student in Chen's lab, led the study and designed the cover image.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has long been attractive as a clean and renewable fuel. A hydrogen fuel cell powering an electric vehicle, for example, emits only water vapor. Currently, however, hydrogen production still depends heavily on fossil fuels (mostly using steam to extract it from natural gas). Finding a low-cost, efficient way to extract hydrogen from water through electrolysis would be a major breakthrough. Electricity from renewable sources such as solar and wind power, which can be intermittent and unreliable, could then be easily stored and distributed as hydrogen fuel.</p>
<p>Currently, the most efficient catalysts for the electrochemical reaction that generates hydrogen from water are based on platinum, which is scarce and expensive. Carbon-based materials have shown promise, but their performance has not come close to that of platinum-based catalysts.</p>
<p>In the new composite material developed by Chen's lab, the ruthenium ions embedded in the carbon nitride nanosheets change the distribution of electrons in the matrix, creating more active sites for the binding of protons to generate hydrogen. Adding graphene to the structure further enhances the redistribution of electrons.</p>
<p>"The graphene forms a sandwich structure with the carbon nitride nanosheets and results in further redistribution of electrons. This gives us greater proton reduction efficiencies," Chen said.</p>
<p>The electrocatalytic performance of the composite was comparable to that of commercial platinum catalysts, the authors reported. Chen noted, however, that researchers still have a long way to go to achieve cheap and efficient hydrogen production.</p>
<p>In addition to Peng and Chen, coauthors of the study include Wanzhang Pan and Jia-En Liu at UC Santa Cruz and Nan Wang at South China University of Technology. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the NASA-funded Merced Nanomaterials Center for Energy and Sensing.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cssc.201702375/full</url><title>ChemSusChem Cover Profile</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="edfffbb38072701755dd2f8d5afacd84"><name>sap-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Strategic academic planning update</title><summary>Through extensive engagement with the campus community, we have worked to identify the major academic themes that make UC Santa Cruz extraordinary. </summary><start-date>1515744000000</start-date><display-name>Strategic academic planning</display-name><path>/2018/01/sap-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/sap-update</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1515821463436</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1515821463436</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>We hope your winter quarter is unfolding well. We write today with one of our regular updates on our strategic academic planning (SAP) effort, and to remind you of important upcoming events.</p>
<p>Through extensive engagement with the campus community, we have worked to identify the major academic themes that make UC Santa Cruz extraordinary. This outreach will continue through much of the quarter. Our consultants have already spoken with hundreds of campus leaders, faculty and staff members, and with a host of boards, associations and committees from on and off campus whose work is intertwined with our academic enterprise. All of us eagerly await the results of our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jfbHxNfn1TQfJ4ffpdQz0rBa1RZHVULI/view">faculty insights survey</a>, which asked our Senate faculty to weigh in on the campus&#8217; most promising existing and emerging areas of research. A future survey will solicit input from everyone on campus. We are committed to robust engagement with all those who have a stake in our academic mission.</p>
<p>Later this month, we will host a series of open forums to give faculty, staff, and students the chance to share ideas on, and ask questions about, the strategic academic planning process. Expect these events to be conversational and interactive.</p>
<p>To maximize attendance, we have scheduled seven forums, at various times and locations, over three days, Jan. 23-25. The when, where, and who-should-attend <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/events.html">details</a> of the various events can be found on our <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/index.html">SAP website</a>. We&#8217;re asking interested parties to RSVP by Jan. 22, so if you want more information about the process, or want to ensure that your ideas are heard and discussed, plan on attending!</p>
<p>Remember, there is also an <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/online-forum.html">online forum</a> for the campus community to ask questions, make suggestions, and engage in debate. And, we have an <a href="mailto:academicplan@ucsc.edu">email address</a> and an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScN8cOXGiJ9fIu2H4G_aPw35BxawknNQewUmtZPrgLJ0mcwmw/viewform#start=invite">electronic suggestion box</a> already in place to gather your thoughts. Be assured that we read each and every comment and suggestion submitted and do our best to respond to all questions.</p>
<p>A reminder that <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/comms-reports.html">notes</a> from all forums and group meetings, past and future, are or will be posted on the website. There, you&#8217;ll also find a list of the people our consultants have interviewed, as well as all reports and surveys from this year&#8217;s academic-planning effort.</p>
<p>After the campus has an opportunity to weigh in on our most promising academic themes through the various forums, surveys, group meetings, and one-on-one interviews, we will establish a series of Themed Faculty Working Groups. Each group will bring together faculty interested in contributing to a themed area to strategize on how the targeted infusion of new resources, combined with the elimination of internal, structural barriers, would allow the area to thrive. We want the themes deemed most critical to the campus community to emerge organically, and then we want to understand what each group would need to best support its research and teaching.</p>
<p>By the close of February, we will complete the first stage, the information-gathering, of our work, which is foundational to the entire planning process. In March, the second phase will begin with a series of workshops and focus groups with campus constituents. At those events, we will work to encourage consensus around the academic themes on which we should build. A Future State Design workshop is being organized for the campus community on Tuesday, March 20, from 1:30-5 p.m., in 108 Digital Arts Research Center (DARC). We&#8217;ll post more details on the session when they are finalized. In the meantime, please mark your calendar to join the conversation.</p>
<p>We believe wholeheartedly in the power of UC Santa Cruz to leave a lasting impact on our students and on the world &#8212; and are committed to identifying and making the changes necessary to ensure this vital outcome. Please join us in this effort.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community </audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp and Associate Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Martin Berger</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0007427f8072701755dd2f8ddfaefd78"><name>keynote-humanities</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New name, enduring vision</title><summary>Irena Polić, Managing Director, and Nathaniel Deutsch, Director, The Humanities Institute — Since its founding, The Humanities Institute has been committed to cultivating humanities research by supporting hundreds of individual faculty, graduate, and undergraduate fellows, as well as collaborations across campus and with other universities around the world.&#13;

<p>Since the institute was founded in 1999, it has been committed to cultivating humanities research by supporting hundreds of individual faculty, graduate, and undergraduate fellows, as well as collaborations across campus and with other universities around the world.</p>
<p>Over nearly two decades, our work has evolved and our reach and impact have grown. We are now one of the few humanities institutes dedicated to matching research development with a public mission.</p>
<p>Historically, these two camps have been separated. We&#8217;re proud to bridge this gap and believe that our humanistic training and ideas, rooted in rigorous scholarly research, can inform public discourse and be accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>In recent years, we have committed ourselves to engaging with the broadest community possible&#8212;from first-generation students, to local residents, to anyone interested in compelling ideas and making sense of this increasingly complex world.</p>
<p>This effort will be on display later this month in the latest of our <em>Questions That Matter</em> events in downtown Santa Cruz. <a href="questions-that-matter.xml"><em>Freedom and Race</em></a> will feature Jennifer Gonzalez, professor of history of art and visual culture, and Tyler Stovall, dean of the Humanities Division and a professor of history, in a conversation that focuses on the relationship between freedom and race, which continues to vex the United States and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Our new name&#8212;The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;better represents our expanded and unique mission. And our new website is better suited as a platform for this rich engagement with the broader community, making all of our work easier to access.</p>

Born in Salt Lake City in 1937, the only child of Wallace and Mary Stegner, he was, as he sometimes remarked, born on wheels. Throughout most of his life he divided his time between California and Vermont, with an extended stopover in Santa Fe, New Mexico. As a youngster, he attended Palo Alto High, and went on to complete his undergraduate and graduate work at Stanford University. Within three years of earning his Ph.D. he became a member of the pioneer faculty at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he taught for over three decades and ran the Creative Writing program.</p>
<p>A gifted and distinguished writer of both fiction and nonfiction, literary criticism (he was one of the rare writers about Vladimir Nabokov that Nabokov himself admired), and environmental ethics, he was also a frequent reviewer for the <em>New York Times, the New York Review of Books</em>, as well as a contributor to publications such as the <em>Atlantic</em> and <em>Esquire</em>. In one year alone he was awarded what he referred to as the trifecta: a National Endowment for the Arts, a National Endowment for the Humanities, and a Guggenheim.</p>
<p>Not content with a life of letters, he took a three-year leave of absence from the University in the late sixties to become the deputy director of the Peace Corps in Ecuador and Venezuela. He played bluegrass guitar with the Red Mountain Boys, and was fond of reminding people that he sold Jerry Garcia his first guitar. He and his father, Wallace Stegner, collaborated on several projects, including the book <em>American Places</em> (with Eliot Porter). And it was well known among family that Page served as his father's editor, particularly on such books as <em>Crossing to Safety</em>.</p>
<p>In the early eighties, wanting to provide an experiential element to a course he was teaching on environmental writing, he began taking students down the great rivers of the West. Thence began his avocation as a river runner: from the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon to the Owyhee at flood stage, he negotiated the big hydraulics of the American West with as much sangfroid as he did the crocodiles on the Orinoco.</p>
<p>He was famously, memorably, inimitably funny, often raveling out stories that left everyone in the room undone. Never superior to his subject, he was often the hapless human at the center of his tales of derring-do. When one of his dozen or so books came out, its subtitle, a curmudgeon at large in the American West, became the perfect descriptor for his grumpy championing of the natural world. As a friend recently remarked, Hollywood should have optioned his personality.</p>

<p>Today, the longed-for promise of medical benefits endures and the quest for more data continues, but widening global inequality begs the question of how any benefits might be distributed, particularly to those with little or no health care.</p>
<p>Sociologist Jenny Reardon, founder of the Science and Justice Research Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz, evaluates the promise and pitfalls of genomics in her new book <em>The Postgenomic Condition: Ethics, Justice, and Knowledge After the Genome</em> (University of Chicago Press, 2017). The book is based on a decade-long ethnographic study of people around the globe who were trying to transform genomics from a lofty, high-tech endeavor of elite researchers into a justice-driven initiative that would yield benefits for all.</p>
<p>Reardon, a professor of sociology and a former gene sequencer, brings science, history, and politics together in her narrative, asking fundamental questions about inclusion, informed consent, justice, access, and the challenge of interpreting genomic data. With hundreds of millions of public and private dollars invested in genomic research, Reardon provides a timely assessment&#8212;not only of what has been achieved but what's at stake.</p>
<p>"It turns out that interpreting the human genome is much harder than anyone thought it would be," says Reardon. As a result, researchers are focused now on identifying and interpreting variation in the human genome, which requires more data from more people of more diverse backgrounds. That, however, is challenging, because fundamental issues of consent, trust, and use of biological samples remain unresolved, she said.</p>
<p>"When you don't consider ethical and political issues, along with the technical challenges, you often hit roadblocks, which has been the case with genomics, both in the past and today," says Reardon.</p>
<p>Genomics&#8212;the field that digitized DNA&#8212;has produced some clear benefits, including genetic testing that identifies breast cancer variants and helps more women know if they are at high risk of the disease. But Reardon, who likens data from human bodies to natural resources, as plentiful and promising as the timber, oil, and fish of bygone eras, says the field faces many pressing questions today, including:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Who benefits from genomic research today, and on what basis can others be promised benefits in the future?</li>
<li>Should funding for genomic research be tied to requirements for funding basic health care?</li>
<li>Should the sequencing of one's genome move from the elite activity of a privileged few to a respected activity of many?</li>
<li>Is it ethical to ask individuals to sign over any and all use of their biological samples in perpetuity?</li>
</ul>
<p>Reardon presents several case studies that bring these questions to the fore and help to illustrate the challenges encountered on the path to creating "a genomics that was of, for, and by the people."</p>
<p>In <strong>Tuskegee, Alabama</strong>&#8212;the site of an infamous example of scientific racism and abuse of human subjects, where a U.S. government-funded syphilis study withheld diagnosis information and treatment from 400 African American men&#8212;genomic researchers attempted to pursue a "policy of inclusion" in the mid-1990s by recruiting minority residents to contribute DNA samples. The effort ultimately collapsed amid questions about consent and the use of samples, concerns about stigmatization, and the inescapable truth that residents who lack access to even the most basic medical care had little enthusiasm for cutting-edge scientific research they felt was unlikely to ever benefit them.</p>
<p>In <strong>Scotland </strong>in the opening years of the new millennium, leaders saw Scottish DNA as a natural resource of commercial and medical value and set about joining the "international bioeconomy." They went through doctors' offices and institutional review boards to contact potential research subjects, and they promised to keep samples in the country. However, their effort to maintain Scottish sovereignty by keeping the tissues of 25,000 research subjects inside Scotland's borders faced challenges when researchers needed access to technology outside of the country to "translate" the deluge of sequencing data into relevant medical insights.</p>
<p>In the heart of <strong>Silicon Valley</strong>, 23andMe launched in 2007, seeking to "democratize DNA" and fuel a "people's genomic revolution" with spit kits and social networking. The vision of empowering people by giving them the tools to control their own genomic data captured the public's attention&#8212;and promptly became caught up in legal and ethical challenges.</p>
<p>"Each initiative started with a grand vision of purpose&#8212;countering racism, protecting sovereignty, democratizing science&#8212;but ultimately the vision confronted these unanswered questions of fairness, governance, and trust," says Reardon, author of the 2005 book <em>Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in an Age of Genomics</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Data deluge </strong></p>
<p>If the first phase of the "genomic revolution" created lots of genomic data, the second phase is dominated by efforts to "free data from institutional silos" and to advance biomedical research worldwide, according to Reardon. However, a whole genome sequence is too big to open on a personal computer, and viewing a genome sequence&#8212;never mind interpreting the data&#8212;requires access to universities or companies that have enough computing power. Universities and corporate partners keep the dream of "precision medicine" alive, framing their work as a "moral good" and inviting people to contribute biological samples as part of their urgent effort to save lives.</p>
<p>"For many, these developments did not represent a corrosive intrusion of corporate culture into the protected space of the doctor-patient relationship, but rather innovation," writes Reardon.</p>
<p>Reardon explores the broader effects of this embrace of big-data approaches to medicine, including concerns about trust and what constitutes medical authority when data is shared widely across multiple institutions, and even the future of patient-provider relationships in an era when apps and do-it-yourself "empowerment" is becoming a mantra for medical care.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>"Many promoters of genomics promise individuals new extraordinary powers: the secret of their lives and the cure to cancer, but they promise too much," says Reardon. "What's needed are more modest aspirations that are responsive to the needs of a stressed health care system, the lived realities of patients, and the complexities of biology." How, she asks, should society respond to the creation of high-tech genomic medicine whose products&#8212;such as the new immunotherapies&#8212;cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year? How can we forge collaborations across the informatic, biological, and medical sciences needed to make sense of genomic data?</p>
<p>"Interpretation of genomic data is a complex issue,&#8221; explains Reardon. &#8220;It cannot be solved by science and technology alone. It requires genome scientists, social scientists, legal scholars, bioethicists, clinicians, industry leaders, and patient and social justice advocates working together to figure out how to transform the promise of genomics into benefits accessible to a broad range of publics. Good science, good medicine, and the good society are made together."</p>
<p><strong>Call to action</strong></p>
<p>Reardon is calling for a new national commission to focus on justice in human-subjects research. The commission, she argues, should address three persistent questions that have bedeviled genomics: First, how can we ensure that investments in science and technology benefit more&#8212;and more diverse&#8212;people? Second, do we need a public institution to support conversations about science and technology and to help facilitate policy change? And third, what is the relationship between innovation in science and technology and inequality?</p>
<p>Addressing these issues will enhance the value of genomics research, asserts Reardon.</p>
<p>"Genomics may lead to new drugs, but they won't come cheap," she writes. "Difficult decisions will confront health care providers and governments as they try to decide how to allocate public and private resources to create access to them. For genomics to make good on its promise of improving well-being, we need to focus on these issues and chart a path forward that advances the goals of science <em>and </em>justice."</p>

It's called convergent evolution, and familiar examples include the wings of birds, bats, and insects, and echolocation in bats and dolphins. Now, molecular biologists have found evidence of convergent evolution in an important mechanism of gene regulation in humans and mice.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/12/1715531115.abstract?sid=0adc15f1-f4bd-4975-939f-118ff0eb01c8">published January 15 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, was led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz and the University of Rochester Medical Center. They described a complex system that regulates the same genes in the same way in both species, yet evolved independently in the two lineages.</p>
<p>In both cases, the regulatory system involves noncoding RNA (sequences not translated into protein molecules) with origins in DNA segments randomly inserted into the genome by "jumping genes" (retrotransposons).</p>
<p>"This study highlights the importance of noncoding RNA and transposable elements in the regulation of gene expression and in the evolution of gene expression networks in mammalian genomes," said coauthor Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Only about 2 percent of the human genome is copied into messenger RNA molecules to code for the proteins that run the main processes in all cells. Most of the rest of the genome is transcribed into noncoding RNA whose function is largely unknown but which is suspected of playing a variety of roles in gene regulation and evolution.</p>
<p>Many of these noncoding RNAs are copied from repeated DNA sequences called short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). Once transcribed into RNA, they can be copied back into DNA and "pasted" into the genome at new locations in a process called retrotransposition. Sometimes these new copies land in or near genes and can damage them. Other times they can add new properties to the gene.</p>
<p>In the human genome, the major SINE family is made of so-called "Alu elements." There are more than 1 million copies of Alu, comprising more than 10 percent of human DNA, scattered throughout the genome, and some of them are likely still able to jump to new locations.</p>
<p>The mouse genome, however, doesn't have Alus; instead it has a distinct set of SINEs called B/ID elements. Different mammalian genomes have different SINEs because periodic bursts of retrotransposition by different SINEs continued to occur after the separation of different species from their last common ancestors. In the case of human and mouse, their lineages diverged about 90 million years ago.</p>
<p>"Surprisingly, when the mouse and human genomes were compared, the locations of SINEs were very similar, even though the SINEs themselves and the events that placed them at those locations were very different," Ares said. "We wondered what could explain this apparent convergence of SINE insertion in two independently evolving genomes."</p>
<p><strong>Gene expression</strong></p>
<p>Lynne Maquat's lab at the University of Rochester found that SINEs that land in the part of the gene encoding the tails of the messenger RNA (called the 3-prime untranslated region or 3'-UTR) bring the mRNA under the control of a protein called Staufen, which down-regulates expression of the gene by a process called "Staufen-mediated decay" or SMD. Individual examples of SINE-mediated SMD were previously documented in both human and mouse cells, in each case with different SINEs.</p>
<p>Since the modern SINEs in the human and mouse genomes were not in the common ancestor, all of the changes in gene expression that depend on SINEs must have occurred after humans and mice separated, and not in their common ancestor.</p>
<p>"Normally we think of important gene expression control systems as having evolved long ago, but for regulation by SINE-mediated SMD, this cannot be the case," Ares explained. "The question we asked was: Are there any cases where the same gene in mouse and human have been brought under SINE-mediated SMD, albeit using different SINEs at some point during the separate evolutionary histories of mice and men? If so, how many? And how common is convergent evolution of gene regulatory networks? How often do SINEs play a role in critically altering gene expression control?"</p>
<p>These questions were explored in a collaboration between the Rochester and UCSC labs, in which muscle precursor cells (myoblasts) from both organisms were analyzed to identify gene pairs (the mouse and human gene coding for the same protein) that had a SINE inserted in the mRNA tail and were under control of Staufen. Examples of such gene pairs in numbers greater than expected by chance would signal the possibility of convergent evolution of the Staufen regulatory network in myoblasts, where SMD is known to be important for gene control.</p>
<p>In myoblasts, the researchers were able to detect 24 genes that are both regulated by Staufen and have species-specific SINEs. This is a minimum number of potentially convergent pairs because not all genes are expressed in myoblasts, Ares noted. Additional experiments in the paper confirm the role of the SINE (by removing it and showing the mRNA becomes stable and insensitive to the presence of Staufen) for two gene pairs.</p>

<p>Hosted by Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell, the event attracted more than 75 people from across campus and the community to University Center, where they paid tribute to Gliessman, Campbell, and Alec and Claudia Webster, whose support made the new chair possible.</p>
<p>The chair, which honors Professor Emeritus Steve Gliessman, a pioneer of the field of agroecology, was established with a $500,000 gift from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation and matching funds from the UC Regents. The chair will support research and teaching on the linkages between water resources and sustainable food systems, with a special focus on groundwater research, watersheds, and surface water management.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal noted Gliessman's pathbreaking accomplishments and his tireless promotion of agriculture that is "clean, fair, and profoundly democratic."</p>
<p>"Steve was very much swimming against the tide when he first began to talk about agriculture as an ecosystem," said Blumenthal. Today, agroecology is a signature program at UC Santa Cruz, and it is also taught at major universities all around the country, which are "quick to acknowledge that a lot of what they're doing began right here at UC Santa Cruz, and that was with Steve," he said.</p>
<p>Gliessman, who joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1982, received a standing ovation when he took the podium. He described the "awesome support" he received as the inaugural holder of the campus's first endowed chair, the Ruth and Alfred Heller Chair in Agroecology. The power of the chair, he said, was that it allowed him to "turn teaching and research into action&#8230; to push boundaries, and reach beyond academic protocol."</p>
<p>The recognition of the chair, along with the annual financial support it provided, helped Gliessman attract the support of a freshman legislator in Sacramento&#8212;then-Assemblyman Sam Farr, who went on to become an influential member of Congress and a decades-long supporter of the Agroecology Program, which became the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). Farr, who attended the investiture, beamed from the front row as Gliessman spoke.</p>
<p>Also in the audience was Jim Cochran of Swanton Berry Farm, with whom Gliessman partnered in the mid-1980s to develop organic methods to grow strawberries. "Everyone said we were both crazy, and we didn't have any money for research," recalled Gliessman, who used chair funds to launch the experiments that would ultimately prove successful, upending strawberry production on the Central Coast and beyond.</p>
<p>"Today, agroecology is science, agroecology is practice, and agroecology really is truly a social movement," said Gliessman, who retired in 2012. "You need all three or it's not agroecology."</p>
<p>Gliessman then charged Campbell with "taking it to the next level at UCSC," saying "Complex problems need complex solutions. Put your vision into action."</p>
<p>Campbell, who joined the faculty in July 2017 from UC Merced, is an environmental engineer who builds large-scale regional and global models to explore the viability of sustainability initiatives at the intersection of food, water, and energy.</p>
<p>"It is beyond humbling to take on a chair in Steve's name," he said.</p>
<p>Campbell's models of environmental systems use big data to address questions that are fundamental to agroecology, such as how much food can be produced locally and how much energy is used to pump water to irrigate crops. "I bring something new," said Campbell, referring to an approach that uses big data gleaned from satellites and relies on physics, chemistry, biology, atmospheric and biospheric science, as well as knowledge of human systems.</p>
<p>Raised in Santa Cruz, Campbell shared a childhood memory of family outings to pick up beach litter and take it to the recycling center. Joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty felt like coming "full circle," he said. He saluted his colleagues in environmental studies, saying they "don't just talk about interdisciplinary work. It permeates the entire department."</p>
<p>The Webster family is well known on campus for its generosity, having funded the renewal of the Hay Barn, the naming of Rachel Carson College, and several endowed chairs for faculty. Alec Webster, president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, has known Gliessman since the late 1980s when he was working in a campus lab. When he enrolled as an environmental studies student, Gliessman promptly became his mentor.</p>
<p>Claudia Webster acknowledged Gliessman's wife, Robbie Jaffe, the founding director of the Life Lab Science Program, saying, "Steve and Robbie are not just extraordinary professors. They're activists. They walk the walk. These people are our heroes. They are continuing as this driving force for good in the world."</p>
<p>Alec Webster followed Claudia, saying, "The thing about Steve is he thinks outside the box. He walks the walk, and most importantly, he walks outside the box. He doesn't pull any punches. We hope Elliott will do the same kind of thing: walk outside the box."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0aae6c33807270176c500acfb2cccbbb"><name>mens-volleyball</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Men's volleyball aiming for championships</title><summary>Aided in May by the passage of Measure 68, the referendum that will go to support athletics, the Slugs this season are scheduled to play more than 30 matches—a noticeable uptick from the 19 games last season. </summary><start-date>1516262400000</start-date><display-name>Men's volleyball</display-name><path>/2018/01/mens-volleyball</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/mens-volleyball</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1516302657500</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1516302657500</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Andrew Matheson</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/mens-volleyball-group-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/mens-volleyball-group-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mens-volleyball-group-500px.jpg</name><display-name>mens-volleyball-group-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>277457</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Men's volleyball group photo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/mens-volleyball-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/mens-volleyball-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mens-volleyball-80px.jpg</name><display-name>mens-volleyball-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17918</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Men's volleyball players</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>That schedule has the Slugs on the road beginning in late January and lasting through March, though the team will have an alumni exhibition on Feb. 24 at home.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/huddle-volleyball-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/huddle-volleyball-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>huddle-volleyball-500px.jpg</name><display-name>huddle-volleyball-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>268740</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Men's volleyball team huddles</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Last season&#8217;s performance by the UC Santa Cruz men&#8217;s volleyball team would be considered a success by most metrics. The Banana Slugs compiled a 14&#8211;5 overall record (including an undefeated mark through the month of February), ending their campaign with three straight victories. They finished with the No. 9 ranking in the NCAA Division III AVCA Coaches Poll.</p>
<p>But, despite their accomplishments and top&#8211;10 ranking, the Slugs fell short of qualifying for the NCAA tournament. No need, of course, to explicitly state the team&#8217;s remaining objective.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s definitely the goal,&#8221; said senior outside hitter Ryan Manley (Monte Vista High/Cupertino), who was a freshman when the Slugs last reached the postseason tournament in 2015. That year, UC Santa Cruz went 23&#8211;5.</p>
<p>Aided in May by the passage of Measure 68, the referendum that will go to support athletics, the Slugs this season are <a href="http://www.goslugs.com/sports/mvball/2017-18/teams/ucsantacruz">scheduled to play</a> more than 30 matches&#8212;a noticeable uptick from the 19 last season. Among the challengers will be 23 D-III opponents (also an increase, from just 14 last year)&#8212;matches that will go a long way determining if the Slugs&#8217; name will be called by the NCAA in April.</p>
<p>The Slugs (6&#8211;0) take to the road this week to face UC San Diego in La Jolla on Friday and UC Merced Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a push and we&#8217;re going to have to perform in some high-pressure matches,&#8221; Manley said. &#8220;But I think this group is able to do it, especially with the guys coming in.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re deep enough to take on the schedule in front of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>That schedule has the Slugs on the road beginning in late January and lasting through March, with only the team&#8217;s alumni exhibition on Feb. 24 slated at home. The Slugs will play as far north as Milwaukee and as far east as Poughkeepsie, N.Y.&#160;</p>
<p>Third-year head coach Paul Leon, who has been involved with the UC Santa Cruz program for the last eight years, said the heavy road slate is standard practice as a D-III team on the West Coast. If the Slugs are able to extend their season to the NCAA tournament, becoming road warriors will need to be part of the team&#8217;s mentality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re geared up and ready to go,&#8221; said Leon, who feels the depth among his 17-player roster, which includes 10 who returned, will help the Slugs push deep into the season.</p>
<p>Leon lost three players last season to graduation, including kills leader and second team All-American Jake Howard. But outside hitter Lake Merchen (Buchanan High/Clovis) returns to the roster and will once again guide the Slugs. The 6-foot&#8211;3 senior last season was named All-American first team by the AVCA for a second time, becoming the fourth Slug to do so and the first since Salvatore La Cavera in 2013.</p>
<p>Manley said his standout teammate is special, exhibiting a great mindset and a high volleyball IQ. It&#8217;s like having another coach on the floor; Merchen does as much with the Mountain View Volleyball Club.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been amazing since freshman year,&#8221; Manley said of Merchen, who is closing in on career records for kills, digs, and aces.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;For his size, he&#8217;s pound for pound one of the smartest and strongest outside pin attackers in Division III,&#8221; Leon said. &#8220;There&#8217;s very few that can do what he can do, at the level that he can do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merchen will, no doubt, garner much of the spotlight from the opposition. But the Slugs are hoping not to rely solely on their All-American.</p>
<p>Along with the 6&#8211;5 Manley, senior outside hitter Gino Gamboa (Bishop Alemany High/Van Nuys) will help UCSC on the attack. Gamboa returns from medical leave last season, after registering 1.82 kills per set as a junior, while outside hitter Chris Salas (Camarillo High/Camarillo) joins the roster as a junior transfer from Moorpark College.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been a really good addition,&#8221; Manley said of Salas, noting the transfer player&#8217;s passing.&#160;</p>
<p>Junior Kyle Donohoe (Victor High/Victor N.Y.), who last season was third in kills, could provide a midseason boost on the attack. The 6&#8211;3 opposite underwent shoulder surgery in the offseason and is expected to return to the lineup in late January/early February.&#160;</p>
<p>Senior setter Evan Kittle (Nevada Union High/Nevada City) returns after playing as a sophomore, when he recorded a team-best 592 assists.&#160;</p>
<p>Also returning are juniors Raymond Cascio (Obama Academy/Pittsburgh, Pa.) and Justin Fortner (Hart High/Santa Clarita), who at 6&#8211;7 and 6&#8211;6, respectively, provide plenty of size from the middle blocker position.</p>
<p>Like Salas, libero Max Garris (St. Monica High/Santa Monica) is also a junior transfer, from Santa Monica College, and will offer a different look alongside returning junior libero Jonathan Santos (St. Ignatius College Prep/Daly City).&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the team to have confidence,&#8221; Leon said, &#8220;that whoever is in will get the job done.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz added four first-year students to the roster, with setter Sam Wittert (Santa Monica High/Santa Monica), and outside hitters Ian Pizzuti (Redondo Union High/Redondo Beach), Quinn Barrett (Leigh High/San Jose) and Anthony Sagely (Thousand Oaks High/Camariilo) looking to make an impact.</p>
<p>Manley was a freshman in 2015&#8212;the last time the Slugs qualified for the NCAA tournament. He is one of six current players who competed that season, along with Merchen, Kittle, Gamboa, setter Shad Harris (Edison High/Huntington Beach) and defensive specialist Cody Hiroto (Rio Hondo Prep/Temple City).</p>
<p>Qualifying again for the NCAA tournament would validate the Slugs&#8217; growth in recent years, Manley said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the cohesion as a whole unit,&#8221; Manley said, &#8220;there&#8217;s no one who feels their voice can&#8217;t be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really different from previous years,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and I&#8217;m excited for it. We look really strong off the bat.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0add0b55807270176c500acfa827d944"><name>pell-grants</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pell Grant, campus resources key in transforming student lives</title><summary>Roughly 40 percent of UC Santa Cruz students receive Pell Grants, which help to give every student an opportunity for a higher education, regardless of their economic background. </summary><start-date>1516262400000</start-date><display-name>Pell grants</display-name><path>/2018/01/pell-grants</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/pell-grants</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1516305712924</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1516305712924</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Cheri O'Neil</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/alina-coronado-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/alina-coronado-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alina-coronado-400px.jpg</name><display-name>alina-coronado-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>329963</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>Alina Coronado</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/alina-coronado-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/alina-coronado-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alina-coronado-80px.jpg</name><display-name>alina-coronado-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>16565</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alina Coronado</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Now in her second year, Alina Coronado&#160;works as a financial aid peer adviser and a resident adviser.

She&#8217;d never heard of the late Sen. Claiborne Pell, whose work more than 45 years ago helped to give every student an opportunity for a higher education, regardless of their economic background. As the eldest of three children, she&#8217;d be the first in her family to go to college.</p>
<p>Now in her second year at UC Santa Cruz, Coronado is among the roughly 40 percent of students to receive a Pell Grant. She also works as a financial aid peer adviser and a resident adviser, and she&#8217;s active in MEChA de UCSC, an organization committed to the advancement and civil rights of Chicano students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am extremely grateful for the opportunity this has unlocked for me,&#8221; said Coronado, a cognitive science major who hopes to research the development of human speech. &#8220;By receiving this assistance and support, I could accept an offer from UCSC, and my outlook on my future career could become more visibly available to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pell Grant is the flagship federal student aid program that helps provide college access each year to millions of students from the lowest family incomes. According to the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/2017report/fsa-report.pdf">U.S. Department of Education</a>, almost $27 billion is disbursed annually to more than 8.3 million students through the Pell grant. Unlike student loans, this is needs-based grant money that doesn&#8217;t have to be paid back.</p>
<p>The Pell Grant can pay up to about half the in-state tuition at University of California campuses, and is an extremely valuable program, said Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of Undergraduate Education at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education is vital to a healthy and productive life for anybody,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the Pell Grants positively impact students, helping them to become graduates and become ready for future jobs and future studies with a level of experience and critical thinking and skills that will help them succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/uc-leads-way-enrollment-and-six-year-graduation-pell-grant-recipients">data</a> shows how UC schools lead the way in enrollment and six-year graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients. Forty-two percent of all first-time degree-seeking students at UC schools in 2010 were Pell Grant recipients, compared with 22 percent at other schools. And for those Pell recipients, UC schools reported an 81 percent six-year graduation rate, compared with 86 percent for non-Pell students.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Hughey said, most Pell students graduate in about four years. The changes that will make more students eligible to receive the Pell Grant for summer classes in 2018 can further speed student achievement, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Financially, the very best thing that any student can do&#8212;regardless of income level&#8212;is to graduate quickly. They can then move on to the next stage of their education or the start of their career. Being able to have students attend during summers will be hugely important.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, students should take advantage of college life outside of coursework, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important for them to expand with leadership, knowledge, internships, undergraduate research, mentoring, and campus or community activities,&#8221; Hughey said. &#8220;Pell Grants give a little more room for that and may reduce the need to carry multiple jobs and work more than 10 to 15 hours a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, financial aid isn&#8217;t the only determiner of student success.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a strong commitment by UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff to make sure we&#8217;re supporting all of our students, wherever they&#8217;re coming from or whatever their background or income level might be.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b4f6ab2807270176c500acfec3ad0fc"><name>haney-canada</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Judge relies heavily on Haney's testimony in case banning solitary confinement </title><summary>In a landmark court ruling that prohibits solitary confinement in Canada, a Canadian judge relied heavily on expert testimony by Psychology Professor Craig Haney.&#13;

(Photo by Jay Mallin)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In a landmark court ruling this week that prohibits solitary confinement in Canada, a Canadian judge relied heavily on expert testimony by Psychology Professor Craig Haney.</p>
<p>Haney, who has spent decades studying the psychological effects of imprisonment, was involved in the nine-week trial that took place last summer in Vancouver, testifying about the effects of segregation on mental health.</p>
<p>"It is a stunning ruling. It could not be more decisive or far reaching," said Haney. "It gratifying to see how carefully and astutely the judge worked through the complicated scientific evidence to reach his conclusions."</p>
<p>Haney, whose expertise has figured prominently in numerous <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2009/02/2730.html">court decisions</a> regarding the treatment of prison inmates in the United States, said the decision is in line with a trend he has seen in recent years in this country, as well. "Here it's on a case-by-case or state-by-state basis," he said, noting that Colorado, Washington, Maine, Mississippi, and California are among the states that have limited or eliminated solitary confinement.</p>
<p>"The head of the California Department of Corrections has said Pelican Bay was essentially a mistake, a failed experiment," said Haney, referring to the state's notorious "supermaximum security" prison in Northern California, where more than 1,000 inmates were held in solitary confinement until recently. "They came to this view grudgingly, but they finally turned their thinking around."</p>
<p>Because the Canadian judge invalidated rules that apply throughout the federal prison system in Canada, his ruling applies to the entire country, said Haney, who submitted two reports and testified in the case. The judge's decision is being called "the most important prison law decision from a trial court in Canadian history."</p>
<p>"This decision will help alleviate a great deal of suffering in Canadian prisons," said Haney. "It is part of a worldwide movement to address this cruel practice. I am grateful my work could be part of it.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Judge Justice Leask cited Haney's testimony extensively, concluding that solitary confinement poses "significant risk of serious psychological harm" to inmates, increasing the risk of mental pain and suffering, self-harm, and suicide. Solitary confinement causes a range of psychological effects, including anxiety, withdrawal, hypersensitivity, cognitive dysfunction, hallucination, aggression and rage, paranoia, self-mutilation, and hopelessness&#8212;all of which are exacerbated for mentally ill inmates, he wrote.</p>
<p>Inmates subjected to solitary confinement are at risk of becoming more dangerous within the walls of an institution, as well as in the community outside following their release, according to Leask. To alleviate suffering, the Canadian correctional system must invest in new construction, but more importantly, a "new mindset," he wrote.</p>
<p>In his testimony, based on decades of scientific research, Haney described the impact of solitary confinement on inmates, who are forced to adapt in socially pathological ways. They gradually change their patterns of thinking, acting, and feeling to cope with the "profoundly asocial world in which they are forced to live, adapting to the absence of social support and the routine feedback that comes from normal, meaningful social contact," Leask wrote of Haney's testimony. "Although their adaptations may have been functional in isolation, they are typically acutely dysfunctional in the social world most inmates are expected to re-enter." In some cases, inmates become disabled and are unable to live a "remotely normal or fulfilling social life."</p>
<p>The harmfulness of segregation is widely accepted in the scientific community and there is a growing consensus to restrict or eliminate its use among correctional organizations, human rights groups, religious groups, and mental and medical health associations, said Haney, who has <a href="mailto:https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/06/haney-solitary.html">testified before Congress</a> about the perils of solitary confinement.</p>
<p>"There has been a noticeable shift among professional organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association, which have come to the conclusion that segregation is harmful and often counterproductive," said Haney.</p>
<p>"More recently, correctional organizations have come to the same conclusion, banning it for certain vulnerable populations like juveniles, the mentally ill, and pregnant women and limiting its use for others," he added.</p>
<p>In the final years of the Obama administration, Haney and others worked with the Justice Department to introduce new limits on the use of isolation in federal prisons. However, Haney said the fate of those regulations is now "very much in doubt."</p>

There will be two shows, at 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tickets are available online at <a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/3201025">Brown Paper Tickets</a> and in person at the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a>.</p>
<p>During many journeys to Africa over the past thirty years, Lanting and Eckstrom have documented the wildlife and natural heritage of some of the most celebrated landscapes on Earth, from the sweeping vistas of the Serengeti Plains and the water wilderness of the Okavango Delta to the enchanting deserts of Namibia, the bewildering jungles of the Congo Basin, and the otherworldly island of Madagascar.</p>
<p>With their images, videos, and stories, Lanting and Eckstrom will share an enduring vision of the continent&#8217;s primeval natural heritage, along with fresh impressions about what is at stake in the 21st century.</p>
<p>INTO AFRICA is based on Frans Lanting&#8217;s landmark exhibition of the same name, which was produced as a partnership with the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s National Museum of Natural History and the National Geographic Society, with support from the World Wildlife Fund. Lanting and Eckstrom&#8217;s new book, INTO AFRICA, was released in October 2017; copies will be available for sale and signing at the event.</p>
<p>Proceeds from this show will benefit the marine science education and conservation programs at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Long Marine Lab. Overlooking the Monterey Bay, the Seymour Center is a "living classroom" featuring exhibits, aquariums, touch pools, whale skeletons, full-scale elephant seal models, the Ocean Discovery Shop, and unsurpassed ocean vistas. The aquariums and exhibits feature the everyday tools of ocean exploration and focus on research conducted by scientists locally and around the world. Interactive stations provide hands-on learning experiences, and docents lead tours and bring marine science to life. The center is a community-supported marine science education center of UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>01-28-2018</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1f33694a807270176c500acfef73965f"><name>high-surf-advisory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>High surf warning continues through weekend</title><summary>The National Weather Service's high surf warning remains in effect today.

<div>
<ul>
<li>WAVES AND SURF: Large westerly swell of 14 to 18 feet with a period of around 15 seconds through this afternoon.</li>
<li>TIMING: Today and likely through the weekend.</li>
<li>IMPACTS: Extreme wave run up is expected with with long lulls in between wave sets. These conditions increase the risk of being washed into the sea by a wave. Expect large and dangerous surf, which will result in potentially deadly rip currents.&#160;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Recommendations, if going to the beach:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Never turn your back to the ocean. Always keep your eyes on the ocean.</li>
<li>Stay away from and out of the water during swell events.</li>
<li>Stay farther back from the water's edge and off rocks and jetties.</li>
<li>If an area is wet, assume that another wave will reach that location again.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to rescue pets that have been swept into the sea, most pets will make it out of the water on their own.</li>
</ul>

<p>In response to feedback from the campus community, the Office of Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization (IATC) redesigned and digitized the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/raSa8WIzLQYkRyZL2">Invention Disclosure Form</a> in November 2017. The new form has two goals: one is to make it easier for inventors to disclose new inventions to IATC and the other is to help inventors to focus on patents and licensing.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of having to fill out a paper form, decipher unclear requirements, and find witnesses to sign on a line.</p>
<p>Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Faculty members appreciate the streamlined approach and being able to start the invention disclosure process with a Google Form.</p>
<p>This change underscores our commitment to bring service to the forefront of our work. After our Assistant Vice Chancellor Mohamed Abousalem joined UC Santa Cruz in summer 2016, he set out to rebuild our technology transfer organization and reinvigorate and reinvest in our campus outreach efforts.</p>
<p>The invention disclosure form is the first step in the tech transfer process, which is why we wanted to make the act of completing the form as seamless as possible. We have also eliminated the need for a separate software disclosure form; the new invention disclosure form includes specific questions concerning software inventions, including whether or not it is intended to be offered under an open source license. Once we receive the completed form, we share it with our system office and begin scheduling follow-up meetings to make sure we are protecting this important intellectual property.</p>
<p>We've shared this change with department chairs in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and Baskin School of Engineering, and we are now going to each department to introduce ourselves and share information about all the services we offer.</p>
<p>Last year, we received more than 50 invention disclosures&#8212;an all-time high. We think there are many more ideas and inventions that can be commercialized through patents and licensing. Any faculty members, graduate students, and staff members who have developed a product or a process that solves a well-defined technical problem should be sure to share their discovery with our office.</p>
<p>As a public university, bringing our new knowledge to Californians and beyond is integral to our mission. This happens in myriad ways: courses, public talks, publications, and tech transfer. There are also many other reasons to disclose inventions: they look great on CVs, the inventors receive 35 percent of any licensing royalties, and UC covers all the expenses for securing patents.</p>
<p>All it takes is time, and with the new disclosure online form&#8212;hopefully quite a bit less than ever before.</p>

archive</article-subhead><article-text><p>Award-winning author and UC Santa Cruz literature professor Karen Tei Yamashita will read from her new memoir on Thursday, February 1, as part of the 2018 winter installment of the <em>Living Writers Series</em>.</p>
<p><em>Letters to Memory</em> (Coffeehouse Press) examines her own family&#8217;s experience in a Japanese-American internment camp during World War II through letters, stories, photographs, official documents, art, journals, and other personal records found in the family archive.</p>
<p>Set in five thematically linked sections titled <em>Poverty, Modernity, Love, Death</em>, and <em>Laughter</em>, Yamashita exposes the cruelty, humiliation, and absurdity that her extended family suffered in the relocation camp.</p>
<p>In the process, she ponders the big questions&#8212;such as what is the meaning of evil, justice, war, and forgiveness?&#8212;and considers the answers suggested in classic works like the <em>Illiad, </em>the <em>Mahabharata,</em> and <em>King Lear</em>.</p>
<p>As <em>Literary Hub </em>said of the book, &#8220;Yamashita goes beyond her family&#8217;s story as internees to unpack what that experience became as they dealt with the ordeal of building new identities and re-establishing their communities in the face of great loss and ongoing racism. It also very personally deals with the author&#8217;s emotions regarding this legacy. This is the work of establishing these deeds as an ongoing, living part of America&#8217;s being.&#8221;</p>
<p>Co-director of the Creative Writing Program at UC Santa Cruz, Yamashita received a 2011 California Book Award in the Fiction category for her novel <em>I Hotel</em>, and was&#160;a finalist for the National Book Award. <em>I Hotel</em> also won the American Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association Award, and the Association for Asian American Studies Book Award.</p>
<p>Known for her intensely researched works that reflect her interest in communities whose stories often go untold, Yamashita received the Chancellor&#8217;s Award for Diversity in 2009 and was co-holder with feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker of the UC Presidential Chair for Feminist Critical Race and Ethnic Studies.&#160;</p>
<p>Her other books include <em>Through the Arc of the Rain Forest</em> (1990), which received the American Book Award, and <em>Brazil-Maru</em>, named by the <em>Village Voice</em> as one of the 25 best books of 1992.</p>
<p>Her third novel, <em>Tropic of Orange</em> (1997), was a finalist for the Paterson Fiction Prize, and she followed that with <em>Circle K Cycles</em> (2001), a book based on her research on the Brazilian community in Japan.</p>
<p>Yamashita&#8217;s February 1 reading for the Living Writing Series will take place at the Humanities Lecture Hall, beginning at 5 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Upcoming readings in the winter series will include <strong>Duriel E. Harris</strong> on February 15, <strong>Cecilia Vicu&#241;a</strong> on February 22, and an <strong>undergraduate student reading</strong> from the UC Santa Cruz Creative Writing Program on March 15.</p>

Last summer Ray Gutierrez&#8217;s coursework took him to India, where he filmed a documentary about hearing-impaired students facing a gut-wrenching choice between family and opportunity.<br/><br/>Ray Gutierrez (Oakes &#8216;18, film) does not present himself as an adventurer about to travel the world. He says he&#8217;s very shy, though he is gregarious and fills his conversations with compliments and gratitude. If he is shy, it isn&#8217;t stopping him from pursuing his ambitions. <br/>
<h3>Family storyteller</h3>
Gutierrez grew up in Gilroy. He would make up stories to tell his brothers, which grew into an interest in film. He studied at Gavilan Community College and transferred to UC Santa Cruz in 2016. He&#8217;s the first in his family to attend a four-year university. His parents worked on his grandfather&#8217;s cucumber farm. <br/><br/>&#8220;They&#8217;re all very proud,&#8221; he says of his family. &#8220;My parents are my heroes. I helped them once, and let me tell you it was tough. The heat, the hard work, it is no place for the weak at heart.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>Opportunity knocks</h3>
Shortly after he came to UC Santa Cruz, he learned that an anthropology field study, Globalization, Technology and Development, which included five weeks of study in India, had room for more students. He approached the sponsoring professor, anthropology lecturer Annapurna Pandey, and told her he wanted to come and make a documentary while he was there. <br/><br/>&#8220;I was thrilled,&#8221; Pandey says. She hoped his project would help show other students the unique experiences possible with field studies.<br/>
<h3>A chance to transcend poverty</h3>
In July, Gutierrez joined Pandey and the field study cohort at Centurion University in the mostly rural Indian state of Odisha. Centurion was established to train Odisha&#8217;s youths with skills relevant in a modernizing economy. <br/><br/>During their five weeks in India, the UC Santa Cruz students lived and studied alongside Centurion&#8217;s regular students. They toured of the region, visiting sites like the famous Sun Temple. And they spent 12-hour days interviewing students and teachers about the culture of Odisha and how global influences are affecting it. <br/><br/>One of the groups they met were the students with hearing impairments. These youths, who might otherwise have spent their lives in subsistence agriculture, were training to be baristas. <br/><br/>In Odisha, where many children are expected to live at home and support their parents until they marry, a disability like deafness might mean a very limited life. The barista training offers an avenue to self-support and the possibility of switching roles from dependent to breadwinner. Gutierrez decided they would be the subject of his documentary.<br/><br/>The documentary, an early cut of which is linked at the top of this article, follows the students through a day marked by intense study and camaraderie. <br/>
<h3>Pushing against tradition and family</h3>
His subject&#8217;s lives included tensions he had never imagined. They felt both dedication and intense obligation to family.<br/><br/>&#8220;The primary concern was what I can do for mom and dad because they brought me to this Earth,&#8221; Gutierrez says.<br/><br/>Not every family wanted their child to leave and find work. Some of the women felt pressured to return home and get married. <br/>
<h3>Heroes in a noisy world</h3>
This group with all their shared struggles formed a supportive community. They would applaud each other&#8217;s work. The 30 or so students went from class to class together communicating through text messaging. <br/><br/>&#8220;They had to study from 7 a.m. to 11 at night and they loved it,&#8221; says Gutierrez. Their determination, he says, inspired him to be a better student. <br/><br/>Graduation from the training brought a new challenge. The students would be placed in positions at caf&#233;s around the country. Most had not travelled more than 20 miles from home before coming to Centurion. <br/><br/>&#8220;They had tears in their eyes,&#8221; says Gutierrez. &#8220;They were scared of what the future would hold for them.&#8221;<br/><br/>Gutierrez hopes to be able to return next summer to find out whether the barista trainees will continue toward careers or return to their families. He hopes by introducing people to these &#8220;heroes in a noisy world,&#8221; his documentary will help overcome cultural differences. <br/><br/>&#8220;The only thing different from us is our cultures, but that&#8217;s a beautiful thing,&#8221; he says.<br/><br/>When he graduates, Gutierrez wants to focus on international collaborative film projects.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="34d884c1807270176c500acf5f60611f"><name>nanopore-genome</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Breakthrough leads to sequencing of a human genome using a pocket-sized device</title><summary>Nanopore sequencing technology, based on concepts pioneered at UC Santa Cruz, has revealed parts of the genome scientists had been unable to sequence before.</summary><keywords>Miten Jain, Benedict Paten, nanopore, MinION</keywords><start-date>1517241600000</start-date><display-name>Breakthrough leads to sequencing of a human genome using a pocket-sized device</display-name><path>/2018/01/nanopore-genome</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/01/nanopore-genome</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1517010059424</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518028920667</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/minion-iphone-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/minion-iphone-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>minion-iphone-410.jpg</name><display-name>minion-iphone-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>60322</file-size><width>410</width><height>308</height></image><image-alt>MinION sequencer next to iPhone</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/01/images/minion-iphone-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/01/images/minion-iphone-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>minion-iphone-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>minion-iphone-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17923</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>MinION sequencer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The MinION&#8482; DNA sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies is a pocket-sized, portable DNA sequencer based on nanopore sequencing technology pioneered at UC Santa Cruz.

<p>The research, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060">published January 29 in <em>Nature Biotechnology</em></a>, involved scientists at UC Santa Cruz; the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI); the University of Nottingham, University of Birmingham, and University of East Anglia in the U.K.; and the University of Utah, University of British Columbia, and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Toronto.</p>
<p>Using a pocket-sized, portable DNA sequencer based on nanopore sequencing technology pioneered at UC Santa Cruz, the scientists sequenced a complete human genome, in fragments hundreds of times larger than usual, enabling new biological insights. This included detecting structural variants and epigenetic modifications in the genome, as well as closing 12 gaps in the human reference genome, thereby improving its accuracy.</p>
<p>"The ability to get long reads is one of the strengths of this technology, and as a result this is the most contiguous human genome assembly ever done," said co-first author Miten Jain, a postdoctoral researcher in biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Jain is one of seven lead authors who contributed equally to the paper, three of whom are at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Ultra-long sequences</strong></p>
<p>The researchers generated a new method for sequencing &#8220;ultra-long&#8221; sequences of DNA, more than a thousand times longer than the original reads used to generate the human genome reference sequence in 2001. Recently the authors have used this method to generate the longest read ever sequenced at 1,204,840 bases in length, 8,000 times longer than a typical sequencing read.</p>
<p>This drastically reduces the complexity of piecing together the genome compared to previous techniques. The authors speculate that these reads and longer ones can be generated routinely in the future, enabling nanopore sequencing of human genomes as complete as the reference genome, which involved over 20 years of work and more than $2 billion of funding.</p>
<p>"About 8 percent of the human genome has yet to be assembled, mostly in long, complex regions with lots of repetitive DNA sequences. With repetitive sequences, if you only have short reads it's hard to piece them together, and you can't tell how much there is," Jain explained. "If you can cover that region with a few long reads, however, it's a much easier puzzle to solve."</p>
<p>As well as sequencing previously uncharacterized regions of the genome, the new analysis provided greater insight into regions of the genome that are responsible for functions such as immunity and tumor growth. This in turn may have a profound impact on clinical practice by, for example, enabling detection of large genome rearrangements important in the development of cancer or determining a person&#8217;s inherited repertoire of antibody genes.</p>
<p><strong>Personal genomes</strong></p>
<p>The ability to sequence using a portable device that only costs $1,000 may also put personalized genome sequencing into the mainstream.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a landmark for genomics. The long reads that are possible with nanopore sequencing will provide us with a much clearer picture of the overall structure and organization of the genome than ever before,&#8221; said corresponding author Matt Loose of the University of Nottingham.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you imagine the process of assembling a genome together is like piecing together a jigsaw puzzle, the ability to produce extremely long sequencing reads is like finding very large pieces of the puzzle, which makes the process far less complex,&#8221; added Nick Loman of University of Birmingham, also a corresponding author.</p>
<p>The study uncovered new information about the major histocompatibility complex, a region of the genome that plays a critical role in the immune system and is used for tissue typing before a transplant. This area is particularly difficult to analyze as it contains many duplicated regions, including gene families and repeated sequences. No two individuals, apart from identical twins, have the same sequence in this region of their genome.</p>
<p>The researchers also used ultra-long sequences generated in the project to determine the lengths of individual telomeres for the first time directly from the sequenced data. Telomeres are the caps at the ends of each DNA strand which protect the chromosomes and play an important role in how cells age. The older a cell, the shorter the telomeres, and disruptions in the pattern of a telomere's DNA is a significant issue found in many tumors. These regions are also highly repetitive, often appearing identical, making them hard to study.</p>
<p><strong>International effort</strong></p>
<p>The international research effort used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer. The sequencer, approximately the size of a mobile phone, sequences the DNA by detecting the change in current flow as single molecules of DNA pass through a tiny hole (a "nanopore") in a membrane.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that a pocket-size sequencer is going to give us the ability to bring sequencing much closer to the patient,&#8221; Loman said. &#8220;At the moment sequencing is quite laborious and occurs in expensively equipped laboratories, but in the future we can imagine sequencing using pocket-size devices in GP surgeries, in clinics, and even in people&#8217;s own homes. The ability to sequence and assemble even very large complex genomes may have value one day in diagnostics and monitoring the evolution of diseases such as cancer and a wide range of infections.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Jain, coauthors of the paper affiliated with the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute include Karen Miga, Arthur Rand, Ian Fiddes, Hugh Olsen, and Benedict Paten. Loman and Loose led the international consortium. This work was supported in part by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the U.K. Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/nanopore-sequencer.html</url><title>New

formally launch the <strong><em>VizWall</em></strong>, a large-scale visualization installation, and the <strong><em>VizLab,</em></strong> a Virtual Reality and 360 Lab, will take place on February 7, at the David Kirk Digital Scholarship Commons on the ground floor of McHenry Library.</p>
<p>The&#160;VizWall&#160;is a&#160;14'x4'&#160;screen installation that enables large scale presentation of visual materials or simultaneous interaction with multiple pieces of digital content. It now offers the entire campus community a new space to visualize their research and create interactive digital media.&#160;</p>
<p>The new VizLab creates an opportunity for students to experience and develop projects in Virtual Reality. It also provides the campus with access to a high performance, graphics intensive workstation with available 3D modeling, animation, and Virtual Reality software.</p>
<p>These new spaces were created through partnerships between the University Library, The Humanities Institute, the Humanities Division, CITIRIS, and the IDEA Hub.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spaces highlight how collaborative infrastructure projects create new possibilities for research, teaching, and learning on campus, and the role of the library as a hub for scholarly experimentation,&#8221; said Rachel Deblinger, director of the Digital Scholarship Commons</p>
<p>&#8220;The vision and leadership of The Humanities Institute has fostered a dynamic community of researchers on campus that has opened up these new partnerships,&#8221; she noted. &#8220;We will continue to work together to build the necessary infrastructure to inspire and enable ever changing modes of scholarly production and presentation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deblinger added that the lab space has already been used for curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arts faculty have been bringing their students to the VizLab to draw and create in 3D, and a number of history and other humanities faculty will be using the lab this quarter to have students explore virtual reality spaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opening reception will include a presentation by assistant professor of history Elaine Sullivan about her work with 4D models of ancient Egyptian temple sites. Demonstrations in Virtual Reality will also be available throughout the event.</p>
<p>The Digital Scholarship Commons plans to additionally host <a href="http://calendar.library.ucsc.edu/calendar.php?cid=546&amp;t=d&amp;d=0000-00-00&amp;ct%5B%5D=34259&amp;cal%5B%5D=546">two lectures at the VizWall</a> this winter.</p>
<p><em>_______________________________________________________________________</em><em></em></p>

The 36-hour coding marathon is also an opportunity for Silicon Valley companies to meet the next generation of innovators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sponsors including Google's virtual reality product, Daydream, and UC Santa Cruz's Genomics Institute challenged the 88 teams to produce apps employing a range of technologies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kerrie Lu, a City College of San Francisco student, and her team, Epsilon, created <a href="https://devpost.com/software/epsilon-3s0jpi">an app that can identify redundant data</a> to address the growing burden of data processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I expect an opportunity to test my coding skills, meet some new people, and hack a new app," she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu's team's app was recognized by sponsor Big Data Federation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amlaan Bhoi, a masters student from the University of Illinois, Chicago, came with a team that created <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vrcalm">a soothing virtual reality environment for anxiety sufferers</a>. For Bhoi's team, the hackathon was also an excuse to visit Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"That inspired us to attend and make something great," he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-executive directors Anjali Kanthilal (Crown '18, technology and information management) and Zimraan Hamid (Cowell '18, technology and information management) touted the event as a rich opportunity for networking and collaboration.

<p>Last year, student volunteers helped 500 families claim more than $600,000 in federal and state tax refunds.</p>
<p>"This program provides a great service to people who need it," said UCSC economics major Daniel Vargas, who coordinates the students. "We serve a lot of Latinos who don't have many resources. People are extremely grateful. It's an awesome feeling."</p>
<p>Vargas is in the second year of a three-year paid internship coordinating an IRS program called Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) for Santa Cruz Community Ventures, one of several agencies and nonprofits administering VITA programs locally.</p>
<p>"For many of these families, these refund checks are the biggest checks they get all year," said Community Ventures Executive Director Maria Cadenas.</p>
<p>This year, Vargas and Cadenas are eager to get the word out to even more people. Each year, more than $6 million in tax credits go unclaimed in Santa Cruz County, according to Cadenas.</p>
<p>"A lot of people don't know about this or don't take advantage of it," said Vargas, who is in the process of recruiting 15-20 volunteers, all of whom will receive extensive training in tax preparation, as well as serving the public.</p>
<p>In the past, VITA has set up shop in public libraries and at Goodwill. This year, Vargas's team will also operate out of "pop-up" style sites, trying to reach those who need support where they live and work. "You have to provide a lot of personal information for taxes&#8212;your address, Social Security number, income, employer information," he said. " In this climate, we want to take our services to the community, where they'll feel safer."</p>
<p>Most participants get a refund&#8212;but not everyone. "People get frustrated when they find out they owe money," said Vargas. "People who are self-employed often don't realize they need to pay self-employment taxes."</p>
<p>Vargas recalled helping a self-employed hairdresser think through her options after discovering that she owed about $1,000 in taxes. "At first, she was upset," he recalled. "She asked a lot of questions and wondered if we'd done it right." Vargas told her how to request a filing extension and discussed the option of making monthly payments. He also referred her to information about budgeting workshops, credit and debt management, and strategies to avoid getting behind on self-employment taxes in the future.</p>
<p>"That alleviated her frustration," he said. "Through VITA, Community Ventures connects the people we serve to the skills they need to build economic independence&#8212;financial capability skills."</p>
<p>Vargas is a first-generation college student who grew up in East LA, a predominately Latino area. When he was applying to colleges, he knew he wanted to go to an in-state, Hispanic-Serving Institution. Santa Cruz, he said, was "away from home but not too far away."</p>
<p>Last year, Vargas coordinated 19 volunteers who donated more than 1,200 hours to VITA. About half the students Vargas recruits earn academic credit through the Economics Department's field-study internship program. "All the students are really motivated," said Vargas. "This is an opportunity for them to apply what they learned in accounting courses to the real world."</p>
<p>Ninety percent of VITA volunteers are UCSC students, noted Vargas. "We are sometimes underestimated, but this shows how much we can really perform," he said. "Students at UCSC are really making a change."</p>
<p>Vargas jokes that coffee and motivation get him through the busy season, when he works up to 30 hours a week on the program&#8212;in addition to keeping up his schoolwork. "I love math," said Vargas. "It just clicks in my brain."</p>
<p>But being involved with the community this way has broadened Vargas's horizons. He is now interested in public policy.</p>
<p>"This program is amazing, but it only runs a few weeks a year, and it's only one aspect of what the community needs," he said. "We need a system that works for them. I want to go bigger. We need bigger ideas, bigger changes."</p>

Following the Intercollegiate Tennis Association&#8217;s Division III West Regional in late September, everyone else is probably well aware of Ibh&#8217;s court prowess as well.</p>
<p>A left-handed Danish transfer, Ibh advanced to the semifinal round in the Men&#8217;s Open Singles bracket in Claremont, and he garnered the ITA&#8217;s No. 16 regional ranking the following month.</p>
<p>&#8220;He turned a lot of heads down there,&#8221; Napoli, the third-year coach of the UC Santa Cruz men&#8217;s tennis team, said of Ibh. Although likely not known among the opposition before the ITA regional tournament, Napoli added of Ibh: &#8220;He&#8217;s on the radar now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ibh is expected to be a key piece this season for the Slugs, who are looking to return to the NCAA championships after narrowly falling short of a bid last season. Along with a core group of seasoned returners, including Chad Stone, A.J. Flora, Chad LeDuff, and Ryan Dugan, Ibh&#8217;s &#8220;high-level tennis-playing experience&#8221; and &#8220;clay-court style of game&#8221; will help solidify UC Santa Cruz as it tries to regain its footing in the national picture.</p>
<p>Ranked No. 10 in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association&#8217;s (ITA) D-III Men&#8217;s Regional Rankings released on Jan. 18, <a href="http://www.goslugs.com/sports/mten/index">UC Santa Cruz begins its winter/spring slate</a> in the very same position where it ended last season&#8217;s campaign. But without a top&#8211;40 national ranking to begin the year, the Slugs know there is work to be done in order to improve their stature and ultimately score one of the few spots in the NCAA tournament in May.</p>
<p>And the spots are few. Last season, the NCAA&#8217;s 43-team field was comprised of just two teams from &#8220;Pool B,&#8221; which is made up of true independents&#8212;like UC Santa Cruz&#8212;and schools from conferences that do not have an automatic bid.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the time to do it,&#8221; LeDuff said. &#8220;It pushes us to work harder, and we have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>LeDuff noted the amount of experience UC Santa Cruz has this season, including a total of seven returners from last year. The foursome of Stone, Flora, LeDuff and Dugan, meanwhile, played both singles and doubles in nearly every match last season for the Slugs, who finished 6&#8211;8 overall.</p>
<p>Adding Ibh only strengthens the lineup. A physics major from Copenhagen, Ibh was able to compete in higher-level tournaments while in Europe, Napoli said. And the experience and skills are noticeable among teammates. Stone, for one, called Ibh the team&#8217;s &#8220;dark horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s really good,&#8221; LeDuff said. &#8220;We&#8217;re lucky to have him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it means UC Santa Cruz will extend its season into May remains to be seen, of course.</p>
<p>The Slugs (0&#8211;1) on Jan. 21 dropped their first match of 2018 to Division-I foe Fresno State. But the team&#8217;s true test will come opposite a total of eight D-III challengers, five of which entered this season ranked in the top 15 in the nation, according to the ITA.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz opens D-III play against Cal Lutheran (Feb. 17) and Whittier (Feb. 19)&#8212;a mere appetizer to the main course in March, which features six road matches. Stops include No. 12 Pomona-Pitzer (March 24), No. 3 Middlebury (March 26 at Claremont), No. 11 Redlands (March 29) and No. 2 Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (March 30). A match against up-and-coming George Fox (March 28) is also on the slate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a tough schedule,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;But I have a lot of faith in this group of guys, to come through this season and pull off some big upsets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buoying spirits was the team&#8217;s play at the ITA regional. Led by Ibh, LeDuff and Flora in singles, UC Santa Cruz easily exceeded last year&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>Stone (Carlsbad/Carlsbad High), too, was pleased with the team&#8217;s start in the late-September tournament, when he competed alongside Dugan (Coto de Caza/Santa Margarita High) to reach the semifinals in the men&#8217;s open doubles bracket.</p>
<p>The duo in October earned a ranking of No. 24 in the nation by the ITA and No. 7 in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chemistry is getting better and better,&#8221; Stone said of his partnership with Dugan, who he will compete alongside for a third season. &#8220;It gives us a mindset that we already know what each other is going to do (on the court).&#8221;</p>
<p>Stone and Dugan will anchor the doubles pairings, which Napoli said needs to be a strength as it sets the tone for the match.</p>
<p>Flora is expected to team up with Ibh at No. 2 doubles, while LeDuff will be paired with returning sophomore Ryan Gee (Laguna Beach/Laguna Beach High) at No. 3. Napoli could also use the No. 3 position to showcase other less experienced players, considering three of UCSC&#8217;s top five players (Stone, Flora and Ibh) will move on next season.</p>
<p>One player who could see action is Floyd Penners (Carlsbad/La Costa Canyon High), one of four freshmen on the Slugs. Napoli said Penners carries dual citizenship with the United States and the Netherlands, and, along with Ibh, continues the international flavor on this year&#8217;s team.</p>
<p>Freshman Yaroslav Yanin hails from Moscow, while Dev Saraf is from Calcutta, India.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, this is the best team I&#8217;ve been a part of in all four years I&#8217;ve been here,&#8221; Stone said.</p>
<p>LeDuff (Valencia/Valencia High) expressed a similar sentiment. He noted many of the Slugs who compete in doubles will do so in singles as well, which will boost confidence and court time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really looking forward to competing,&#8221; said LeDuff, who has a strong serve and forehand. He reached the quarterfinals in singles at the ITA regional and received a ranking of No. 23 in the region by the association in October.</p>
<p>Last season, Stone and LeDuff played No. 1 and No. 2 singles, respectively. The addition of Ibh provides the Slugs another top option, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not afraid to work the point. He&#8217;s not afraid to get into 10-ball rallies,&#8221; Stone said of Ibh, adding the Dane plays consistently and utilizes a heavy amount of top spin.</p>
<p>&#8220;He likes to take a step back and let the point unravel in front of him,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Ibh&#8217;s left-handedness and European style are unfamiliar aspects for a lot of D-III players, Stone said. It&#8217;s doubly beneficial for the Slugs, LeDuff added, who are able to learn from Ibh&#8217;s style of play.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our chances are really good,&#8221; LeDuff said. &#8220;We play some tough schools, but I think with our team we have a good chance.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6d1fedff807270177653ce784cdf98e1"><name>michael-shipleys-creative-brilliance-continues-to-shine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumnus Michael Shipley's Creative Brilliance Continues to Shine</title><summary>Santa Cruz native and UC Santa Cruz alumnus, Michael Shipley, found Santa Cruz to be an idyllic place to grow up during the 1970s and ‘80s.

It was the place where he discovered his creative passion, eventually leading him to become not only a very talented photographer and musician, but also an award-winning television writer and producer for highly successful television shows, including&#160;<em>Family Guy</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>American Dad!</em>.</p>
<p>Michael&#8217;s connection to UCSC was particularly special since his father,&#160;<strong>William Shipley</strong>&#160;was a beloved and pioneering professor who founded the UCSC Board of Studies in Linguistics and was an expert in the once obsolete Maidu language of Northern California. Professor Shipley died in 2011 after having taught at UCSC since 1966, a year after the university opened. Michael&#8217;s mother, Barbara, was the psychiatrist for the university at Cowell Health Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idealism of the hippie era was winding down, but there was still an enormous sense of hope and excitement about the future,&#8221; says Michael of his time growing up in Santa Cruz. &#8220;The university had drawn so many exceptional colorful people to Santa Cruz&#8230; there was a community for me&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Riding around Santa Cruz</h3>
<p>As a student at Westlake Elementary, Shipley fondly remembers riding his bike with his friends all over the neighborhood, discovering cool places to explore, and never having to worry about locking doors.</p>
<p>By the time he was a student at Santa Cruz High, he was riding his bike down to the yacht harbor and learning how to sail a 35-foot sloop. In almost stereotypical Santa Cruz fashion, his sailing teacher also introduced him to championing for important social causes including UNICEF and Amnesty International.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like so much of my time in Santa Cruz, it was beautiful and conscious and vulnerable,&#8221; says Michael of his childhood. But he also reflects on the what he calls the &#8220;darker&#8221; sides that he witnessed some of friends going through. &#8220;I had friends who were suffering more than I knew from neglect or abuse born of the narcissism and rejection of responsibility with which their parents were gleefully experimenting.&#8221;</p>
<h3>"UCSC was the only place I applied to..."</h3>
<p>When it came time to think about attending college, Michael had one choice. &#8220;Our family was kind of coming apart when I was finishing high school, so I don&#8217;t think our parents were super engaged about where my sister and I were going to go to college,&#8221; he says. &#8220;UCSC was the only place I applied to because it felt familiar and safe. And I knew the values of the school were going to be pretty close to my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>He remembers not only having a great time there, but also getting a great education. One of his teachers was none other than the legendary&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a>&#160;(&#8216;60&#8217;s singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician), who had a profound impact on Shipley and his choice to have an artistic life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I adored taking Tom Lehrer&#8217;s class in the American musical,&#8221; says Michael. &#8220;Tom is an intellectual as well as a creative genius, and I don&#8217;t use that word lightly. Doing five staged readings/singings of musicals in one quarter was wonderful, but Tom&#8217;s lectures were amazing, too."</p>
<p>And there was also a favorite professor who even got a mention years later in one of Michael&#8217;s scripts for&#160;<em>Family Guy</em>. Michael named Old Man Selberg in the&#160;<em>Viewer Mail 1</em> episode after his UCSC fencing teacher, &#8220;Jedi-like&#8221; Charles Selberg.</p>
<p>Besides being a leader in the linguistics field, Michael&#8217;s father acted in and directed plays for many years at UCSC. Michael credits his dad with teaching him how to engage with his own emotions and learning the importance of enjoying life.</p>
<p>He also admired how his father emphasized the value of being polite, although that turned out to have its downsides, too. There were times when Michael discovered that when politeness didn&#8217;t work, he needed alternative tactics, but finding out what those were wasn&#8217;t easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working in Hollywood hasn&#8217;t pried me loose from my belief in kindness,&#8221; comments Michael, &#8220;but it&#8217;s given me lots of practice at developing backup strategies. There are a lot of really good-hearted people working in TV, but there are more than enough ruthless competitive sharks that if you don&#8217;t learn to compete&#8230;to pick yourself up when things explode in your face, you won&#8217;t get to do the creative things you love.&#8221;</p>
<p>A turning point in Michael&#8217;s life came during his 20s when his father told him that he was gay. Michael saw it as yet another vital part of what made his dad into an incredible person, and not something to be called out separately.</p>
<h3>Learning about compassion</h3>
<p>Michael notes how his father&#8217;s deep involvement and feelings for the Native American community helped to teach him how to be compassionate and empathize with people who had far greater challenges than he did.</p>
<p>Of his father, Michael also remembers: &#8220;He liked freedom. He liked kindness. He liked gatherings of good friends, he liked beautiful things in the world&#8230;.Knowledge for him wasn&#8217;t a parsimonious stacking of facts and figures, it was a tool to paint your worldview with the brightest, darkest most interesting colors possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landing at Warner Brothers, where Michael works today, from the sublime bubble of Santa Cruz took more than a few twists and turns. He originally decided to try his hand at acting and thought that moving to Los Angeles would be the way to go.</p>
<p>He had just graduated from UCSC but had also gone through the staggering grief of having his mother die from cancer. &#8220;I was really depressed and didn&#8217;t want to do anything but stare off into space,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;So my girlfriend and I moved to LA together, where I promptly got into a car accident. I was in physical therapy for the next few months."</p>
<p>As difficult as that was, the experience also carried with it an unexpected silver lining. Not being very mobile at the time allowed Michael to really take in how much his friends were struggling in the acting world, and how it was definitely not the right career choice for him.</p>
<p>After his recuperation, he decided to take on practical jobs with steady paychecks by teaching English and working in construction. But after a few years, he realized that &#8220;all that practicality was killing me.&#8221; He got in touch with a fellow UCSC slug, Kelley Gibler, who had a sketch comedy troupe, and ended up writing, acting, and directing a variety of &#8220;bizarre&#8221; comedy sketches that eventually got the attention of some entertainment agents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone asked if we had any TV scripts&#8230;.So one of the guys and I sometimes wrote with fellow slug, Jim Bernstein, and I decided to start writing TV scripts and trying to break into the business, even though we knew nobody and nothing about how things worked in Hollywood.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A big break just in time</h3>
<p>Success didn&#8217;t take hold right away and, after five hard-working years of writing scripts, Michael seriously considered leaving LA. Just as he was making plans to move on, he and Bernstein were called in for an interview to write for a quirky&#160;sci-fi TV show called&#160;<em>Homeboys In Outer Space</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ended up waiting for [the showrunner] in his office, which gave us a chance to screw around with all the sci-fi books and toys he had on his coffee table,&#8221; says Michael. &#8220;He interviewed us and we got the job, but later he told me he&#8217;d been standing in the hall watching us dick around in his office before he came in and that&#8217;s when he actually decided to hire us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As fate would have it, Matt Weitzman and Mike Barker also happened to be writers on that short-lived show. They would both go on to work with&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_MacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>&#160;and, not only write for&#160;<em>Family Guy</em>, but also create&#160;<em>American Dad!</em>.</p>
<p>And, with one thing leading to another, they would eventually recommend Michael and Jim Bernstein to be writers on&#160;<em>Family Guy</em>.</p>
<p>Michael, who refers to Seth MacFarlane as &#8220;ridiculously talented&#8221;, has a favorite anecdote about working with him. (At least one he can repeat publically!) Because MacFarlane was so involved with&#160;<em>Family Guy</em>, his time spent on scripts for&#160;<em>American Dad!</em>&#160;was limited,&#160;so he would catch up during the weekly table reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seth was shockingly unaware of any popular songs recorded after 1960,&#8221; says Michael. &#8220;On this particular day a character that Seth was voicing had to sing a snippet of some song from the &#8216;90s.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacFarlane hadn&#8217;t heard of the song and asked writer Mike Barker to sing it to him. &#8220;Mike sang the melody and Seth scribbled a music staff in the margin of his script and quickly wrote out the melody. When we got to that moment in the table read, Seth sight read the music (and the words) off his script without missing a beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael hopes one day to have his own show on TV and had been working on that when fate again intervened with an irresistible opportunity to write for the CBS hit show,&#160;<em>Mom</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It meant I had to walk away from my development, which was&#160;mildly heartbreaking, but it was too great an opportunity to pass up,&#8221; he says. The Emmy-award winning show was co-created by the industry&#8217;s most successful TV comedy producer,&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Lorre">Chuck Lorre</a>&#160;(<em>The Big Bang Theory</em>,&#160;<em>Two and a Half Men</em>,&#160;<em>Grace Under Fire</em>) and stars&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_Janney">Allison Janney</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Faris">Anna Farris</a>.</p>
<p>As an extra plus, Michael also is working with another very talented UCSC Arts Division alum on&#160;Mom, Emmy-award winning writer&#160;<a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/features/featured-alum/uc-santa-cruz-alumna-anne-flett-giordano-credits-her-extraordinary-writing-career-one-crazy"><strong>Anne Flett-Giordano</strong></a>.&#160;&#8220;And what a glorious bonus that the writing staff on&#160;<em>Mom</em>&#160;turned out to be brilliant and kind,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Along with his writing, Michael&#8217;s remarkable creative talents also extend to photography and music. He has to date produced two CDs,&#160;<em>Blood and Vanity</em>&#160;and more recently the EP&#160;<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/album/voices-in-the-dark-ep/1234090447?mt=1&amp;app=music"><em>Voices in the Dark</em></a>, which contain songs that give insight into his own personal journey.</p>
<p>On&#160;<em>Blood and Vanity</em>&#160;there are a couple of songs that speak directly to his family&#8217;s experience with the Maidu people,&#160;<em>Don&#8217;t Let Me Forget</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Ja&#8217;lulu&#8217;Kojo&#8217;di</em>&#160; (Flute of the Valley&#160;in Maidu). And his fond memories of Santa Cruz are lyrically depicted on&#160;<em>Voices in the Dark</em>&#160;in the song&#160;<em>City By the Sea</em>.</p>
<h3>Finding balance with photography</h3>
<p>His photography provides him a sense of balance. &#8220;It&#8217;s refreshing for me how a photograph, although it shares some visual territory with scripts, is silent, wordless and stops time instead of moving through it,&#8221; he reflects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Photography also helps me explore different parts of myself from the ones that come up when I write scripts. There are very few people in my pictures. I like the resonance of open empty spaces. That&#8217;s often serene, but also often wistful or aching.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked what advice he would pass on to UCSC students who want do to what he does, Michael emphasizes that it&#8217;s crucial to make friends with as many people as possible who are also interested in what you want to do. Taking the initiative and not sinking into passivity is also key.</p>
<p>&#8220;The specific strategies vary depending on what you&#8217;re pursuing, but in general, you should contact everyone you know or someone you know knows in the industry and just ask to meet them and get their insight and advice,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Even reach out to people with whom you have some tenuous connection, like the same name or school or hometown. And be likable. Whether you&#8217;re trying to get a job as an assistant or a producer, people hire people they want to be around.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also encourages students to pursue everything they&#8217;re passionate about in the industry, and not to limit themselves to one professional route, if possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe most importantly, never forget the value of your art whether or not you&#8217;re getting paid for it,&#8221; says Michael. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting and wonderful to get paid for your art, to get that validation and opportunities from the industry, but don&#8217;t let that replace your love of the work.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;And whatever your craft, you should be working on it as you try to become &#8216;successful&#8217;. So love it, value it, indulge in it. The worst thing that will happen is you&#8217;ll have amazing creative adventures, learn about the human experience, have a great time and not make a fortune or become famous.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new year means new beginnings, so I&#8217;ll jump right into an exciting initiative launching this week that will run throughout 2018. We&#8217;ve dubbed this our Year of Alumni. Of course, we&#8217;re always celebrating our alumni&#8212;all 110,000 or so of them&#8212;but this year marks the 50th anniversary of our first alumni association, so we thought we would take the opportunity to honor the many successes of our graduates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re back on campus, you&#8217;ll no doubt notice the banners, installed over winter break, honoring some of our notable alumni. See if you can find all lucky 13! The signs, featuring graduates across the disciplines, are tributes to the culture of innovation, exploration, scholarship, and creative expression here on campus. It&#8217;s exciting to think the faces of current students will one day adorn future banners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expect Year of Alumni talks and visits by returning Slugs throughout this calendar year, and a stellar Alumni Weekend is already in the works. Check out our </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/yoa.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Year of Alumni website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for details, and for a host of features on the great work our alumni are doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the prospective Slugs front, I am delighted to say UC Santa Cruz is more popular than ever. More than 56,000 young women and men applied to join us as first-year students this coming fall. That is a record high&#8212;and well-deserved recognition of the outstanding undergraduate opportunities we offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our hard work to boost transfer students, meanwhile, is paying dividends. We saw a nearly 12 percent jump in the number of applicants from California community colleges. More than 9,800 students applied to transfer to UC Santa Cruz for fall 2018. We will continue to accept transfer applications until next week, so that final number is expected to be even higher!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest from ethnically diverse California applicants is also holding strong. This year&#8217;s figures are in line with last year&#8217;s, with about 5 percent of frosh applicants African-American, 31 percent Asian-American, and 36 percent Chicano/Latino. This trend importantly helps UC Santa Cruz reflect the population of California while also enriching the educational experience of all of our students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As campus becomes even more diverse, I am committed to creating an inclusive environment that values and supports every person in an atmosphere of civility, cooperation, professionalism, fairness and respect. This is important work that is really never finished, and we are always seeking new ways to engage students, staff and faculty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, we hosted a very successful First Amendment event. Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is midway through its wonderful </span><a href="https://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/dialogue-series.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dialogue Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;events aimed at bringing the campus community together to have honest discussions, often about challenging subjects, to foster a healthy campus climate. In addition, we&#8217;re looking at safety improvements&#8212;improved lighting and an expanded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Safe Ride Program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;to enhance the overall feeling of safety on campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;d also like to draw your attention to a few upcoming campus-sponsored events.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 30, UC Santa Cruz Dean of Humanities Tyler Stovall and History of Art and Visual Cultural Professor Jennifer Gonzales will lead a conversation on </span><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4449"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Freedom and Race."</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This moderated discussion is part of &#8220;Questions That Matter: A Series of Public Dialogues in Santa Cruz,&#8221; developed by our Institute for Humanities Research.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Feb. 8, we are delighted to have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberl&#233; Crenshaw, professor of law at UCLA and Columbia Law School, and a leading authority on civil rights, race, racism, and the law,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as keynote speaker for our 34th annual</span><a href="http://specialevents.ucsc.edu/mlk/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Nirupama Menon Rao, an ambassador, scholar, and poet, is the featured speaker at this year&#8217;s </span><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4729"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Feb. 23</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These events are unrelated but have a common theme&#8212;the importance of exploring our differences while also celebrating our common humanity. I can&#8217;t think of a better message as we start another trip around the sun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So welcome back to the most beautiful university in the world. Take a moment to appreciate our surroundings&#8212;the redwoods, the meadows, the stunning bay. We should all resolve to do that more throughout 2018!</span></p>
