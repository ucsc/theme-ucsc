Saving leatherback turtles from extinction in the Pacific Ocean will require a lot of international cooperation, however, because the massive turtles may visit more than 30 different countries during their migrations.</p>
<p>A new study uses tracking data for 14 species of migratory marine predators, from leatherback turtles to blue whales and white sharks, to show how their movements relate to the geopolitical boundaries of the Pacific Ocean. The results provide critical information for designing international cooperative agreements needed to manage these species.</p>
<p>"If a species spends most of its time in the jurisdiction of one or two countries, conservation and management is a much easier issue than it is for species that migrate through many different countries," said Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and a coauthor of the study, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-018-0646-8">published September 3 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em></a>.</p>
<p>"For these highly migratory species, we wanted to know how many jurisdictional regions they go through and how much time they spend in the open ocean beyond the jurisdiction of any one country," Costa said.</p>
<p>Under international law, every coastal nation can establish an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from shore, giving it exclusive rights to exploit resources and regulate fisheries within that zone. The high seas beyond the EEZs are a global commons and are among the least protected areas on Earth. Discussions have been under way at the United Nations since 2016 to negotiate a global treaty for conservation and management of the high seas.</p>
<p><strong>TOPP program</strong></p>
<p>First author Autumn-Lynn Harrison, now at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., began the study as a graduate student in Costa's lab at UC Santa Cruz. Costa is a cofounder, with coauthor Barbara Block of Stanford University, of the <a href="http://topp.org/">Tagging of Pacific Predators</a> (TOPP) program, which began tracking the movements of top ocean predators throughout the Pacific Ocean in 2000. Harrison wanted to use the TOPP data to address conservation issues, and as she looked at the data she began wondering how many countries the animals migrate through.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see if we could predict when during the year a species would be in the waters of a particular country," Harrison said. "Some of these animals are mostly hidden beneath the sea, so being able to show with tracking data which countries they are in can help us understand who should be cooperating to manage these species."</p>
<p>Harrison also began attending meetings on issues related to the high seas, which focused her attention on the time migratory species spend in these relatively unregulated waters. "Figuring out how much time these animals spend in the high seas was directly motivated by questions I was being asked by policy makers who are interested in high seas conservation," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Threatened species</strong></p>
<p>The TOPP data set, part of the global <a href="http://www.coml.org/">Census of Marine Life</a>, is one of the most extensive data sets available on the movements of large marine animals. Many of the top predators in the oceans are declining or threatened, partly because their mobility exposes them to a wide array of threats in different parts of the ocean.</p>
<p>Leatherback turtle populations in the Pacific could face a 96 percent decline by 2040, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and leatherbacks are a priority species for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Laysan and black-footed albatrosses, both listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List, spend most of their time on the high seas, where they are vulnerable to being inadvertently caught on long lines during commercial fishing operations.</p>
<p>White sharks are protected in U.S. and Mexican waters, but the TOPP data show that they spend about 60 percent of their time in the high seas. Pacific bluefin tuna, leatherback turtles, Laysan albatross, and sooty shearwaters all travel across the Pacific Ocean during their migrations.</p>
<p>"Bluefin tuna breed in the western North Pacific, then cross the Pacific Ocean to feed in the California Current off the United States and Mexico," Costa said. "Sooty shearwaters not only cross the open ocean, they use the entire Pacific Ocean from north to south and go through the jurisdictions of more than 30 different countries."</p>
<p><strong>International cooperation</strong></p>
<p>International cooperation has led to agreements for managing some of these migratory species, in some cases through regional fisheries management organizations. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), for example, oversees conservation and management of tunas and other marine resources in the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The first session of a U.N. Intergovernmental Conference to negotiate an international agreement on the conservation of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction will be held in September. Harrison said she has already been asked to provide preprints and figures from the paper for this session.</p>
<p>"These migratory species are a shared heritage, and this paper shows their international travels better than ever before," Harrison said. "The first step to protect them is knowing where they are over their annual cycle and promoting international agreements to manage the threats they may face across several countries."</p>

On the Pisgah Lava Flow, however, one finds a very different population of side-blotched lizards, as black as the rocks they live on.</p>
<p>How do animals invade new environments different from the ones for which evolution has equipped them with finely tuned adaptations? Light-colored lizards on a lava flow should be easy picking for predators, so how did they survive long enough to evolve darker coloration?</p>
<p>One explanation has been that many of an animal's traits are not fixed, but can change during its lifetime. This "phenotypic plasticity" enables individual animals to alter their appearance or behavior enough to survive in a new environment. Eventually, new adaptations promoting survival arise in the population through genetic changes and natural selection, which acts on the population over generations. This is known as the "Baldwin effect" after the psychologist James Mark Baldwin, who presented the idea in a landmark paper published in 1896.</p>
<p>Scientists studying the side-blotched lizards on the Pisgah Lava Flow have now documented this process in meticulous detail. They showed how individual lizards can change colors in a new environment to become darker on lava; they identified genes that regulate coloration and that differ between populations on and off the lava; and they found that the genetic changes in the population adapted to the lava flow make those lizards darker than others. Their findings, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.06.075">published September 6 in <em>Current Biology</em></a>, may be the most detailed example of the Baldwin effect occurring in a wild population.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful idea</strong></p>
<p>"It's an old and very powerful idea, and now we have genetic evidence of how it happens in the wild," said coauthor Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Sinervo has been studying side-blotched lizards in California for more than 30 years. First author Ammon Corl, who earned his Ph.D. in Sinervo's lab, is now at UC Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Corl said he first learned of the Pisgah lizard population from an unpublished Ph.D. thesis by coauthor Claudia Luke, now at Sonoma State University.</p>
<p>"Claudia figured out how plastic their coloration is, and I tested for genetic changes that affected coloration in the Pisgah population," Corl said. "Baldwin predicted that plasticity allows organisms to colonize new environments, and they then develop new adaptations through natural selection. Until now, however, we have lacked the genetic tools to show this is going on in a field setting."</p>
<p>When researchers move side-blotched lizards from one background to another (for example, from sand to lava rock), changes in coloration start to appear within a week, and gradual changes in coloration continue for months afterwards. "It seems like there's a slow, gradual build-up of the dark melanin pigment," Corl said.</p>
<p><strong>Heritable differences</strong></p>
<p>The lizard populations on and off the lava flow both have this plasticity enabling them to change color when moved to a new environment. But the two populations also have heritable differences in pigmentation. Genetic analysis revealed differences between the two populations in two genes involved in the regulation of melanin production.</p>
<p>The researchers cross-bred lizards from the two populations, raised the offspring in a common environment, and measured coloration of the offspring. Those experiments showed that variations in the melanin-related genes correlate with the darkness of the lizards' skins.</p>
<p>Genetic sampling of side-blotched lizards surrounding the lava flow showed that the gene variants found in the lava population are restricted to that population, suggesting that the variants arose through mutations that occurred in lizards living on the lava and spread within that population. Demographic modeling studies suggested that the new mutations arose thousands of years after the lava flow occurred about 22,000 years ago.</p>
<p>"We've studied side-blotched lizards all over, even at another lava flow, and these genetic variants are only found at Pisgah, so we know that's where they arose," Sinervo said. "These are genes that govern coloration by controlling the melanin production pathway, but in a complex way. The Pisgah lizards have the best match to the color of the lava of any population, yet they can still go back to sand and match a completely different background."</p>
<p>The range of coloration possible for an individual lizard is remarkable. "In some ways, it's amazing that natural selection still acts in the presence of so much plasticity. All it takes is a bit of a mismatch and that can make the difference between life and death," Corl said. "There is still variation within the population, so we caught natural selection in the process of acting on these genes. We can now conduct further field and lab studies aimed at better understanding how highly plastic traits are shaped by evolution."</p>

<p>IRIS-HEP will address the unprecedented amount of data that will come from the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), the world's most powerful particle accelerator. When the HL-LHC reaches full capability in 2026, it will produce more than 1 billion particle collisions every second, from which only a small number will reveal new discoveries. The collider's increased luminosity will necessitate an increase in data processing and storage, including tools to capture, identify, and record relevant events and enable scientists to efficiently analyze the results.</p>
<p>&#8220;To fully explore this data, we need much more powerful software tools and algorithms. We also need to maximally exploit the evolving high-performance computing landscape and new tools like machine learning, in which computers study existing data sets to learn rules that they can apply to new data and new situations,&#8221; said Princeton University computational physicist and IRIS-HEP principal investigator Peter Elmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even now, physicists just can't store everything that the LHC produces,&#8221; said Bogdan Mihaila, the NSF program officer overseeing the IRIS-HEP award. &#8220;Sophisticated processing helps us decide what information to keep and analyze, but even those tools won't be able to process all of the data we will see in 2026. We have to get smarter and step up our game. That is what the new software institute is about.&#8221;</p>
<p>To address the challenges of HL-LHC data storage and processing, Maltzahn will explore new declarative data access interfaces that allow physicists to express what they want while hiding the mechanics of how this is accomplished.</p>
<p>&#8220;By expressing data needs in a language that makes sense to physicists, they can retrieve the specific information they want without wasting compute and storage resources scanning through unnecessary data to find what they&#8217;re looking for,&#8221; Maltzahn said.</p>
<p>This approach would remove the current burden on physicists of spending a large amount of their time learning how to efficiently store and retrieve data, and would allow them to spend more time on physics research.</p>
<p>The IRIS-HEP project will be co-funded within NSF by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and by the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.</p>
<p>In addition to UC Santa Cruz, the IRIS-HEP project will include participants from Cornell University, Indiana University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Princeton University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, University of Chicago, University of Cincinnati, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, University of Washington, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p>Prior to being selected by Princeton to work on IRIS-HEP, Maltzahn pioneered <a href="http://programmability.us/">Programmable Storage</a> (with funding from NSF, DOE, and industry), which provides the foundation for declarative data access. Shortly after Maltzahn joined UC Santa Cruz, he became a key mentor of Sage Weil who created the successful open-source storage system <a href="https://ceph.com">Ceph</a> as his Ph.D. project. In 2015 Maltzahn established the Center for Research in Open Source Software (<a href="https://cross.ucsc.edu">CROSS</a>) at UC Santa Cruz with the support of a one-time donation by Sage Weil and yearly memberships by Toshiba, Micron, Seagate, Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung.</p>
<p>As technology continues to advance at increasing speed and scientific communities rush to keep up, Maltzahn&#8217;s declarative data access research will become increasingly relevant. &#8220;The future will have many more architectural disruptions, and we need to have a much more declarative way of accessing data if we&#8217;re going to keep up,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b0d666ea807270173e9c65ae210bf557"><name>accessing-resources-off-campus</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Accessing Library Digital Resources from Off Campus</title><summary>On October 5, 2018, the University Library is retiring the use of the library barcode number as an authentication option for accessing library journals, eBooks and online resources from off campus.</summary><start-date>1536267600000</start-date><display-name>Accessing Library Digital Resources from Off Campus</display-name><path>/2018/09/accessing-resources-off-campus</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/accessing-resources-off-campus</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1536270165627</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1536270754761</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On October 5, 2018, the University Library is retiring the use of the library barcode number as an authentication option for accessing library journals, eBooks and online resources from off campus via <a href="https://login.oca.ucsc.edu/">https://login.oca.ucsc.edu/</a> login.</p>
<p>This change is taking place because the barcode login is vulnerable to hackers and puts all UCSC affiliates&#8217; access to licensed resources at a security risk. To help reduce this risk, authentication for remote access will be limited to CruzID Gold.</p>
<p>If you use a library barcode number (usually on your staff/faculty ID or proxy card) to access eBooks, journal articles, and other scholarly resources from off campus, beginning October 5, you will need to access these resources using your CruzID account and Gold password.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you have set your CruzID Gold password or have questions, contact the ITS Support Center for assistance:</p>

<li>Phone: 459-HELP(4357)</li>
<li>In person: Kerr Hall Room 54</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have your CruzID Gold set, there are two methods available for accessing library resources from off campus:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Library&#8217;s OCA service [<a href="https://login.oca.ucsc.edu/login">https://login.oca.ucsc.edu/login</a>] - log in with your CruzID and Gold Password</li>
<li>The campus VPN [<a href="https://its.ucsc.edu/vpn/installation.html">https://its.ucsc.edu/vpn/installation.html</a>] - log in with your CruzID and Gold Password</li>
</ul>

The sexual harassment of students and employees, including sexual violence, interferes with their right to work and learn in a safe environment and is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX of the Education Act.</p>
<p>The&#160;<a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000385/SVSH">UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment</a>&#160;prohibits sexual violence, including sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking. The Policy also prohibits sexual harassment and other specific forms of sexual misconduct. The Policy applies broadly and protects faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p>It is important that all members of our community act as active bystanders to prevent sexual harassment and sexual violence in our community. A critical component of this is fulfilling the Policy&#8217;s Responsible Employee reporting obligation. Any employee who is not expressly defined as a &#8220;Confidential Resource&#8221; pursuant to the policy is a Responsible Employee who must inform the&#160;<a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Title IX Office</a>&#160;when, in the course of their work, they become aware that a student has experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence. Faculty, managers and supervisors, human resources administrators and academic personnel have a broader obligation, and must inform the Title IX officer when they get a report of sexual harassment or sexual violence from a colleague, a subordinate or anyone else affiliated with the University. Reporting to the Title IX officer ensures that those affected by sexual harassment and sexual violence can learn about their rights and resources, and make an informed choice about how to proceed.</p>
<p>A Responsible Employee fulfills their obligation by making an&#160;<a href="https://ucsc-gme-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report/index.php/pid910907">online report</a>&#160;to the Title IX Office or by calling the Interim Title IX Officer, Cherie Scricca, at (831) 459-2462 and providing whatever information they have about the incident, including the names and contact information of any individuals involved.&#160; A Responsible Employee should not conduct any investigation and should not share the information with anyone other than the Title IX officer.</p>
<p>The Policy prohibits retaliation against Responsible Employees and others who report sexual harassment or sexual violence to the Title IX office, or who assist the Title IX office with responding to such a report.</p>
<p>There are confidential resources available on the campus. Most importantly, the&#160;<a href="http://care.ucsc.edu/">CARE Office</a>&#160;provides confidential support to UC Santa Cruz students, faculty and staff affected by sexual harassment or sexual violence. In addition, CARE Director Kelsey Ferrell is available to provide training on how to support staff and faculty when they disclose and how to provide bystander&#160;interventions. Other confidential and resources are listed on the&#160;<a href="http://safe.ucsc.edu/">Sexual Violence Prevention and Response website (safe.ucsc.edu)</a>. Anyone seeking help can also contact the&#160;<a href="https://police.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Police Department</a>&#160;or call 831-459-2231.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Policy or related procedures and requirements, please contact the Interim Title IX Officer Cherie Scricca at 831-459-2462 or email at&#160;<a href="mailto:cscricca@ucsc.edu">cscricca@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Creating a community free of sexual violence and sexual harassment requires an ongoing commitment from everyone. Please join in reaffirming this commitment.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Faculty and Staff</audience><admin>Office of the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b5463e36807270173e9c65aea371aaa1"><name>sounding-it-out</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sounding it out</title><summary>Alumnus Alexis Harte’s long career as a singer/songwriter has included original albums and songs for TV and film, and his company has become a pioneer in scoring and sound design.</summary><author>Peggy Townsend</author><start-date>1536345000000</start-date><display-name>Sounding it out</display-name><path>/2018/09/sounding-it-out</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/sounding-it-out</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1536344603203</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1536351778649</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Music</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/sepia-lex-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/sepia-lex-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sepia-lex-1.jpg</name><display-name>sepia-lex-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>115476</file-size><width>250</width><height>334</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Alexis Harte</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/sepia-lex-1-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/sepia-lex-1-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sepia-lex-1-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sepia-lex-1-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28060</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Alexis Harte</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singer/songwriter Alexis Harte (Crown '91, English literature and journalism)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alumnus Alexis Harte’s long career as a singer/songwriter has included original albums and songs for TV and film, and his company has become a pioneer in scoring and sound design</article-subhead><article-text><p>For Alexis Harte, it was the perfect creative storm.</p>
<p>He was a songwriter, his adolescent daughter loved music, and here was an offer to pen a song about father-and-daughter musicians for a short film being done by Oscar-winning movie director and animator Patrick Osborne.</p>
<p>Harte, a 1991 Crown College graduate who majored in English literature and journalism, pulled out his guitar and went to work. His song, &#8220;No Wrong Way Home&#8221;&#8212;performed by Kelley Stoltz and Nicki Bluhm&#8212;became the heart of Osborne&#8217;s immersive, virtual-reality film, <em>Pearl,</em> which would go on to win an Annie, a Peabody, a Creative Arts Emmy, and be nominated for an Oscar in the Best Animated Shorts category&#8212;the first virtual reality film in that group.</p>
<p>The success of the song and the film is just one of the highlights in Harte&#8217;s long career as a singer/songwriter, one that has included not only original albums but also songs that have appeared in television and film. In addition, Harte cofounded a company that has become a pioneer in scoring and sound design for Google Spotlight Stories, a series of short, virtual-reality films viewers can watch on their tablets and phones.<br/><br/></p>

<h2>An old guitar</h2>
<p>Harte started playing music at 14 when he found an old electric guitar in the attic of his mother&#8217;s house in Berkeley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pulled it out and plugged it in and started banging away and learning songs and chords,&#8221; Harte says. &#8220;It became front and center in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Harte played in a few bands, studied journalism, and decided to become an environmental reporter. He did a two-year masters program at Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, worked in the Amazon doing community forestry work, and eventually got a job as an urban forester in San Francisco. But it was music that always called to him.</p>
<p>Quitting his comfortable government job, Harte began performing and writing songs, some of which were licensed for films, commercials, and television shows. Eventually, he joined forces with composers and producers JJ Wiesler, Scot Stafford, and Dave Lebolt to form Pollen Music Group, a sound design and scoring company headquartered in the Bay Area. The firm&#8217;s location near Silicon Valley soon brought it into the new world of technology and immersive sound design.</p>
<p>According to Harte, his partner, Stafford, had contacts at Google, which was developing a series of animated, virtual-reality films it called Spotlight Stories as part of its Advanced Technology and Projects program. The effort was led by creative director Jan Pinkava (<em>Ratatouille, Geri&#8217;s Game</em>) and included talented directors like Justin Lin of <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> series and Glen Keane, lead animator on Disney classics like <em>The Little Mermaid</em> and <em>Aladdin</em>. Pollen Music Group was tapped to do the music and audio.</p>
<p>The Pollen Group, says Harte, developed and used its own tools to create quality, 360-degree audio for the project. Its system not only helped solve the nausea-inducing sensation of the audio not being synced to the visuals, says Hart, but also became part of the storytelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we want you to turn 180 degrees (as you watch the film) we could put up a sign,&#8221; says Harte, &#8220;or better yet, we could create a sound behind you that makes you turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>For <em>Pearl</em>&#8212;the story of a down-on-his-luck musician who lives in his car with his young daughter and whose musical talent is eventually eclipsed by hers&#8212;Harte set out to pen a song that would enhance the emotionality and power of the film.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re writing (music and lyrics) for a film, you don&#8217;t want to be on-the-nose with something,&#8221; Harte says. &#8220;For instance, if you see the daughter opening a Christmas present in the back seat of the car, there is a sadness and joy to it. The question is, how do you convey that emotion in a lyric without it being too obvious and descriptive.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s really where there is a lot of hand-wringing for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with an animatic, which is a preliminary version of the movie, Harte created a song that centers on dreams and the meaning of home and, in the film, was sung first by the father and then by the daughter.</p>
<h2>Original tracks</h2>
<p>But Harte is also a solo artist whose own version of &#8220;No Wrong Way Home&#8221; won a spot on Sirius radio&#8217;s The Coffeehouse channel. Harte also has recently released a new EP titled <em>Briefcase,</em> with its featured single and video &#8220;The Night of My Death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inspired by the moment Harte inadvertently stepped into the path of a speeding truck and was almost hit, the song is a study of the things we leave undone in our lives.</p>
<p>Harte turns thoughtful when asked about the sentiment of his song and if he sees life as good now that he&#8217;s turned 50.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to say life&#8217;s pretty good,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I look at how lucky I am to get to do what I like doing and getting some recognition for it. &#8230; I struggle with a lot of stuff people my age do, but, on balance, I think how lucky we are to live in a place that&#8217;s not war torn, or where you can turn on the water and the lights. I think: gosh, how lucky can we get? I feel like I have a lot to be thankful for.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b5df25a1807270173e9c65ae331e9bd3"><name>supercomputer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NSF funds powerful new supercomputer for UC Santa Cruz researchers</title><summary>The new high-performance computer system will support research in theoretical astrophysics, climate science, materials science, and other fields.</summary><keywords>Brant Robertson, Nicole Feldl</keywords><start-date>1536562800000</start-date><display-name>NSF funds powerful new supercomputer for UC Santa Cruz researchers</display-name><path>/2018/09/supercomputer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/supercomputer</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1536354623925</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1536594053693</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value><value>Earth Sciences</value><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/disk-outflow-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/disk-outflow-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>disk-outflow-410.jpg</name><display-name>disk-outflow-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>70535</file-size><width>410</width><height>231</height></image><image-alt>image from simulation of galactic outflow</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/disk-outflow-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/disk-outflow-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>disk-outflow-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>disk-outflow-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16571</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image from simulation of galactic outflow</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Astrophysicist Brant Robertson uses supercomputers to study galactic outflows, fast-moving winds of hot gas driven out of galaxies.

<p>Principal investigator Brant Robertson, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics, said he hopes to have the new high-performance computer system up and running by the end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>"It will provide a dramatic increase in the computational power available to the campus, and it will serve a wide range of scientists throughout the division," Robertson said. "We'll be able to do bigger and faster simulations and more realistic modeling of physical processes."</p>
<p>Computational studies have become an essential part of research in many fields. UC Santa Cruz has an especially large and accomplished group of computational astrophysicists who use supercomputers to explore fundamental questions about galaxy formation, dark matter, gravitational wave sources, supernovae, exoplanet atmospheres, and other astrophysical phenomena.</p>
<p>"You can't put a galaxy in a lab or do experiments with black holes because the masses and energies are beyond anything on Earth, so we try to model them through simulations and see how the results compare to observations," Robertson explained. "It's like experimentation in other fields. We do controlled calculations that are predictive in order to test what physics are important for the astronomical objects we're studying."</p>
<p><strong>International reputation</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has established an international reputation as a leading institution for theoretical astrophysics, and the campus's supercomputing facilities have played a key role in that success. This large grant from NSF's highly competitive Major Research Instrumentation program recognizes and supports the campus's continued excellence in this area, Robertson said.</p>
<p>Climate science is another field that relies heavily on computational studies to understand complex phenomena. Nicole Feldl, an assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences, uses climate models to study feedbacks in Earth's climate system.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the tremendous opportunities in astrophysics, the new computational system will support state-of-the-art simulations of planets and their atmospheres closer to home. We&#8217;ll be able to better understand fundamental problems in planetary and atmospheric sciences, to interpret space-borne observations of our solar system, and to probe how circulations and clouds respond to, and in turn influence, future climate change on Earth," said Feldl, who is a co-principal investigator of the NSF grant.</p>
<p>Other co-PIs include Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and Piero Madau, both professors of astronomy and astrophysics, and Nicholas Brummell, professor of applied mathematics. In all, about 20 senior faculty members contributed to the proposal for the grant, illustrating the expanding role of computational science at UC Santa Cruz. In addition to astrophysics and climate science, the new supercomputer system will be used for research in materials science, chemistry, applied mathematics, and computer science.</p>
<p>The new facility will also serve as a training platform for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. The new system will replace the aging Hyades supercomputer, which now has more than 300 registered users and has been a workhorse since it began operating in 2013.</p>
<p>"Hyades has been a good resource for many years, but it's straining under the load, so it's great to have this opportunity to modernize our computing facilities," Robertson said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4363cac807270173e9c65ae43703ed2"><name>tripods-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Data science researchers to tackle privacy challenges in genomics</title><summary>Computer scientist Abhradeep Guha Thakurta has won NSF funding to investigate ways to protect the privacy of individuals while allowing access to large genomic data sets.</summary><keywords>Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, TRIPODS, data science</keywords><start-date>1536678000000</start-date><display-name>Data science researchers to tackle privacy challenges in genomics</display-name><path>/2018/09/tripods-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/tripods-grant</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1536595212463</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1536679901832</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/genome-data-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/genome-data-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>genome-data-400.jpg</name><display-name>genome-data-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>81405</file-size><width>400</width><height>334</height></image><image-alt>genome data graphic</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/genome-data-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/genome-data-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>genome-data-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>genome-data-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23821</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>genome data graphic</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Computer scientist Abhradeep Guha Thakurta has won NSF funding to investigate ways to protect the privacy of individuals while allowing access to large genomic data sets</article-subhead><article-text><p>Rapidly growing databases of human genome sequences represent a potential goldmine of information for health researchers, but access to these databases is tightly controlled and extremely limited due to privacy concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, so far, the dramatic drop in sequencing costs has not translated into a significant increase in publicly accessible large-scale genomic data sets. Hundreds of thousands of whole genome sequences are hidden away on encrypted servers,&#8221; said Abhradeep Guha Thakurta, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Guha Thakurta hopes to unlock the full potential of these data by developing reliable methods for preserving the privacy of individuals whose genomes have been sequenced, while allowing broad access to genomic data sets. He has received a $600,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund the project, which is part of a larger data science effort in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>TRIPODS</strong></p>
<p>In 2017, UC Santa Cruz was one of 12 universities funded by NSF's Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS) program to create small collaborative institutes working on the theoretical foundations of data science. The new award is one of 19 TRIPODS+X grants intended to expand the scope of these cross-disciplinary TRIPODS institutes into broader areas of science, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The multidisciplinary approach for addressing the increasing volume and complexity of data enabled through the TRIPODS+X projects will have a profound impact on the field of data science and its use,&#8221; said Jim Kurose, NSF assistant director for computer and information science and engineering. "This impact will be sure to grow as data continues to drive scientific discovery and innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guha Thakurta's project will investigate approaches for sanitizing sensitive genomic data that provably protects the privacy of individuals in the data set while preserving statistical validity of the data. If successful, this will provide algorithmic tools to allow statistical analyses by geneticists on data sets that were previously inaccessible due to privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Guha Thakurta's team includes genomics expert Russ Corbett-Detig, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering; theoretical computer scientist Dimitris Achlioptas, a professor of computer science and engineering; and statistician Vishesh Karwa at Temple University.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz TRIPODS effort brings together researchers from mathematics, statistics, and computer science to develop a unified theory of data science applied to uncertain and heterogeneous graph and network data. Led by Lise Getoor, professor of computer science and engineering, the researchers collaborate closely with the <a href="https://d3.ucsc.edu/">D3 Data Science Research Center</a> and <a href="https://datascience.ucsc.edu/">Data Science Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
<p>The TRIPODS institutes share expertise and work together to advance NSF priorities. The program aligns with <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/harnessing.jsp">Harnessing the Data Revolution</a> (one of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/index.jsp">10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments</a>), which aims to engage NSF's grantee community in the pursuit of fundamental research in data science and engineering, the development of a cohesive, federated, national-scale approach to research data infrastructure, and the development of a 21st-century data-capable workforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;TRIPODS+X is exciting not only for its near-term impact addressing some of society's most important scientific challenges, but because of its potential for developing tools for future applications,&#8221; said Anne Kinney, NSF assistant director for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=296537&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_51&amp;WT.mc_ev=click</url><title>NSF TRIPODS+X Announcement</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/08/tripods-grant.html</url><title>NSF awards $1.5 million grant for data science research at UC Santa Cruz</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/06/data-science-center.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz launches new data science research center</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c45f81c4807270173e9c65ae2d0e3527"><name>usnwr-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>With track record in social mobility, UC Santa Cruz advances in U.S. News and World Report ranking</title><summary>Boosted by its success in helping students achieve social mobility, UC Santa Cruz jumped this year to among the top 30 public national universities, as ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report. &#13;

UC Santa Cruz came in at No. 26, moving up from 33rd last year.</p>
<p>The campus also ranked 70th among more than 300 national universities, up from 81st last year.</p>
<p>For the first time, U.S. News and World Report&#8217;s <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-santa-cruz-1321">ranking</a> included social mobility among its measures, looking at both Pell Grant graduation rates and how they compare to all other students. Students receiving Pell Grants typically come from households that earn less than $50,000 annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve long been a leader in scholarship and research, but educational opportunity and access are also central to our mission,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;Our faculty and staff work hard to make sure that all students in our diverse student body have a chance to rise on their own merits. It&#8217;s fantastic to see our approach, and our success, recognized.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2017, the U.S. Department of Education released Pell Grant recipient outcomes for the first time, reflecting the entering 2010 cohort of full-time, first-time degree-seeking undergraduates.</p>
<p>No California State University campus or member of the Association of American Universities had both a higher percentage of Pell enrollees and a higher Pell graduation rate than any UC campus, the <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/uc-leads-way-enrollment-and-six-year-graduation-pell-grant-recipients">UC system reported</a>.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, 48 percent of the entering class were Pell students and 77 percent of them graduated within six years.</p>
<p>The campus received high marks for its diversity, as well, earning a spot on a list that looks at ethnic diversity at national universities. US News and World Report&#8217;s diversity index for UC Santa Cruz was .72&#8212;with closer to 1.0 meaning a student is more likely to run into students from a different ethnic group.</p>
<p>In fall 2017, the undergraduate class of UC Santa Cruz was 28 percent Latino/a, 28 percent Asian; 4.2 percent African American, and .8 percent American Indian.</p>
<p>U.S. News and World Report also recognized UC Santa Cruz for its commitment to undergraduate education, putting the campus among the top 30 national universities. The ranking is based on what universities were cited most often by college presidents, provosts, and admissions deans.</p>
<p>The campus ranked 37th on a list of best colleges for veterans.&#160;</p>
<p>The appeal of UC Santa Cruz has never been stronger. Last year, the campus received more than 67,000 applications from high school seniors and community college students. The fall 2019 application is <a href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/apply-online/">now open</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c50a579b807270173e9c65aef4995137"><name>library-mass-digitization</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>  Library digitizes over 6,000 photos from Pirkle Jones/Ruth-Marion Baruch collection</title><summary>Thousands of previously unseen photographs from The Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Collection at UC Santa Cruz are now available online to the general public, thanks to a collaboration between the campus library and the California Digital Library.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, ucsc library, pirkle jones, ruth-marion baruch, california digital library, ucsc special collections &amp; archives</keywords><start-date>1536623400000</start-date><display-name>  Library mass digitization project</display-name><path>/2018/09/library-mass-digitization</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/library-mass-digitization</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1536609112932</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1536700807721</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Library</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/black-panthers-425.png</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/black-panthers-425.png</link><site>news</site><name>black-panthers-425.png</name><display-name>black-panthers-425.png</display-name><file-size>200577</file-size><width>425</width><height>288</height></image><image-alt>Mother and children, #159, 1968.

The work was done this summer as part of a mass digitization pilot project sponsored by the CDL. <br/><br/><em>The Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch Collection</em> documents the people, landscape, and politics of California in the mid-20th century. Capturing the history of California during a time of enormous social change, it is an extraordinary resource for scholars, students, and the public.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz holds the copyright for all of Baruch and Jones&#8217; work. Most of these images were never printed by the photographers, and their publication online is now the first time they will be viewed by the public. <br/><br/>&#8220;The collection is a boon--not just to UCSC, but to UC and the state--and its digitization will increase its use and the prominence of both the campus and the UC system,&#8221; noted University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell. <br/><br/>&#8220;As the holders not just of the physical objects but the artistic rights, UC is charged with disseminating these works as widely as possible and this digitization project will allow UC to share this selection with the broadest possible audience.&#8221; <br/><br/>Three groups of images were selected for the project from the UCSC collection, which includes more than 12,000 photographic prints and 30,000 negatives from the noted California photographers. <br/><br/>They include the <em><strong>Black Panthers Series</strong></em>--taken by Baruch and Jones in 1968 after they were given unprecedented access to the inner circle of the Party&#8217;s leadership; the <em><strong>Death of a Valley series</strong></em>--shot by Jones documenting the last year of the Berryessa Valley in 1956 before it was flooded to create a new reservoir; and additional photos focusing on San Francisco and the greater Bay Area--taken by Baruch, dating from 1944 to 1978. <br/><br/>&#8220;We're the second of three planned CDL pilot projects and unique in the sense that this is a collection of art photography,&#8221; noted Teresa Mora, Head of Special Collections &amp; Archives at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;We are particularly excited that this project allows us to share the entire corpus of Ruth-Marion Baruch&#8217;s work with the world. She was an exceptionally gifted photographer and reintroducing her work is a significant contribution to the historical record.&#8221; <br/><br/>A team from Pixel Acuity set up the digital scanning on-site at McHenry Library, faced with the technical challenge of scanning a large volume of unique material and working with never before seen images.<br/><br/>&#8220;Any time we are able to work with such unique and significant collections, it really is hard not to get caught up in looking at the images during the digitization process,&#8221; noted Eric Philcox, the owner of Pixel Acuity.&#160;&#8220;Normally we are looking looking at technical details--crop, tone and exposure--and try not to, or don't, notice the image much.&#160;This project made that nearly impossible.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;We were able to digitize the collection in four full days of production, though the post-production took a little longer,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We really wanted to make sure it was done to the best of our abilities, due to the significance of the materials.&#8221;<br/><br/>Partnering with the California Digital Library in a digitization pilot project allowed UC Santa Cruz to leverage the CDL&#8217;s expertise in contract and vendor management, and benefitted the CDL and other UC libraries by developing workflows, best practices, and documentation that can be applied to other vendor digitization projects.<br/><br/>&#8220;This project has been a huge success and has greatly helped CDL in our work to refine a general approach to digitization that demonstrates that optimal quality, mass scale digitization of cultural heritage materials can be achieved in a very fast and&#160;cost effective manner,&#8221; noted Paul Fogel of the California Digital Library. <br/><br/>&#8220;This historically significant collection was previously unavailable to all but a handful of researchers, but is now online for the whole world to see,&#8221; he added.&#160;&#8220;Much credit goes to UC Santa Cruz staff for their outstanding organization and preparation.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/jones-baruch-gift.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz receives largest gift in campus history</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c5de27e8807270173e9c65aef1bc0e8c"><name>data-center-maintenance-sept</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Data Center Maintenance - Sept. 12</title><summary>This Wednesday, September 12, from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., ITS will be performing additional work to the campus Data Center network switches.</summary><start-date>1536622200000</start-date><display-name>Data Center Maintenance - Sept. 12</display-name><path>/2018/09/data-center-maintenance-sept</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/data-center-maintenance-sept</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1536622995396</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1536623199417</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This Wednesday, September 12, from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., ITS will be performing additional work to the campus Data Center network switches.

<p>Truvada is a once-a-day prescription medication used to reduce the risk of HIV infection; it is the only FDA-approved form of pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for those at high risk of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The extremely low rate of PrEP use, while not surprising given barriers to access in various parts of the country, is disappointing,&#8221; said Hammack.</p>
<p>Researchers also found that most sexually active gay and bisexual men aged 18-25 are not tested for HIV annually, as recommended by the CDC, and 25 percent of young men have never been tested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worry especially about younger men who didn&#8217;t grow up with the concerns of HIV that men of older generations did," said Hammack. "The low rate of HIV testing probably reflects a degree of complacency and cultural amnesia about AIDS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conducted by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, the study is the first to report on estimates of HIV testing and use of PrEP among gay and bisexual men using a national probability sample in the United States. In the study, researchers examined gay and bisexual men in three age groups: young (18-25), middle (34-41) and older (52-59).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings suggest that health education efforts are not adequately reaching sizable groups of men at risk for HIV infection,&#8221; said principal investigator Ilan H. Meyer, Distinguished Senior Public Policy Scholar at the Williams Institute. &#8220;It is alarming that high-risk populations of men who are sexually active with same-sex partners are not being tested or taking advantage of treatment advances to prevent the spread of HIV.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other key findings regarding PrEP use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visiting an LGBT health clinic and searching online for LGBT resources were associated with greater likelihood of PrEP use.</li>
<li>52 percent of young sexually active gay and bisexual men were familiar with PrEP as HIV prevention, compared with 79 percent of men aged 34-41.</li>
<li>Bisexual and non-urban men were less familiar with PrEP compared with gay-identified and urban men.</li>
<li>68 percent of men who were familiar with PrEP as HIV prevention had a positive attitude toward PrEP use&#8212;despite the low level of usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Significant findings regarding HIV testing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 45 percent of young sexually active gay and bisexual men had been tested for HIV at least annually, compared with 59 percent of men aged 34-41 and 36 percent of those aged 52-59.</li>
<li>Approximately 8 percent of the middle and older groups of men had never been tested for HIV.</li>
<li>Black gay/bisexual men were more likely than white men to meet recommendations for HIV testing, which may be due to recent efforts to target black men for HIV testing.</li>
<li>Visiting an LGBT health clinic and being out as gay or bisexual to health care providers were associated with greater likelihood of HIV testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, gay and bisexual men had to rely on LGBT community sources to receive information about HIV prevention,&#8221; said Meyer. &#8220;Our findings suggest that contact with LGBT community resources&#8212;health clinics and online information&#8212;still serves an important role in HIV prevention.&#8221;</p>

<li>After entering campus at the Bay/High intersection, even-numbered routes will continue up Coolidge Drive&#8212;bypassing the left turn onto Hagar&#8212;to McLaughlin Drive. Intermittent traffic control will hold traffic for about five minutes while filming is underway, after which vehicles will be allowed to proceed west through the Hagar and McLaughlin intersection.</li>
<li>Odd-numbered routes will not be allowed to turn right onto Hagar Drive, but instead will experience the same five minute delays before being directed east along McLaughlin and onto Coolidge as they travel to leave campus at the Bay/High intersection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The production company will also be filming scenes on High Street, which will require the closure of the street from Moore to Storey Streets from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday, Sept. 17 to Tuesday, Sept. 18. Filming will continue through Friday, Sept. 21.</p>
<p>High Street will be closed to everyone, except for busses, bicycles, pedestrians and church affiliates. Filming may involve up to 4 minutes of intermittent traffic control.</p>
<p>Moore Street will remain open to all traffic.</p>
<p>Motorists should consider getting to and from the main campus of UC Santa Cruz using alternate routes, such as Bay Street or Empire Grade.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d3c8c9cf807270173e9c65aecd7ed572"><name>quantum-information</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Quantum information science on the verge of a technological revolution</title><summary>Theorist Yuan Ping is developing computational methods to guide the design of new materials for quantum computing and other quantum information technologies.</summary><keywords>Yuan Ping, quantum computing, qubit, quantum information</keywords><start-date>1536822000000</start-date><display-name>Quantum information science on the verge of a technological revolution</display-name><path>/2018/09/quantum-information</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/quantum-information</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1536856475109</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1536857277645</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/ping-students-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/ping-students-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ping-students-410.jpg</name><display-name>ping-students-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>100760</file-size><width>410</width><height>309</height></image><image-alt>Yuang Ping with Tyler Smart and Feng Wu</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/quantum-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/quantum-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>quantum-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>quantum-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19788</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>quantum information graphic</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Materials scientist Yuan Ping (center) with graduate student Tyler Smart (left) and postdoctoral fellow Feng Wu (right) at the UCSC supercomputer center.

Quantum communications may enable instantaneous, secure transmission of information across vast distances, and quantum sensors may provide previously unheard of sensitivities.</p>
<p>A global race is on to develop these new quantum information technologies, in which information will be stored in quantum bits, or qubits. In conventional digital technologies, a bit is either 0 or 1, whereas a qubit can represent both states at the same time because of a strange phenomenon of quantum physics called superposition. In theory, this will enable a massive increase in computing speed and capacity for certain types of calculations.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, materials scientists are working to develop novel materials that can serve as the foundation for quantum information technology, just as silicon chips paved the way for today's digital technologies. Several different systems for creating and manipulating qubits have been proposed and implemented, but for now they remain too cumbersome for real-world applications.</p>
<p>"Our focus as materials scientists is on what material we should use as the fundamental element to carry the information. Other researchers are more concerned with how to wire it up to make a device that can perform calculations, but we're focused on the material basis of the qubit," said Yuan Ping, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>2D materials</strong></p>
<p>In particular, Ping and other UCSC researchers are focusing on defects in extremely thin materials, called two-dimensional (2D) materials. Defects or imperfections in the atomic structure of a material can function as qubits because information can be encoded in the spin states of their electrons. This phenomenon has been well studied in other types of materials, most notably the "nitrogen vacancy" or NV defect in diamond. But according to Ping, 2D materials offer significant advantages.</p>
<p>"Unlike diamond, 2D materials are relatively cheap and easy to make, they are scalable, and they are easy to integrate into a solid-state device," she said. "They are also stable at room temperature, which is important because a lot of the qubit systems implemented so far use superconductors that can only operate at very low temperatures."</p>
<p>There are a lot of different 2D materials, however, and a lot of ways to put defects into them. The possibilities are almost endless, and it's not practical to synthesize and test them all experimentally to see which have the best properties for quantum technologies.</p>
<p>That's where theorists like Ping come in. She is developing computational methods that can be used to predict the properties of defects in 2D materials reliably and efficiently. In December 2017, her team published a <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.071001">paper in <em>Physical Review Materials</em></a> establishing the fundamental principles for doing calculations to accurately describe charge defects, electronic states, and spin dynamics in 2D materials. (Her coauthors on the paper include postdoctoral fellow Feng Wu, graduate student Andrew Galatas, and collaborators Dario Rocca at University of Lorraine in France and Ravishankar Sundararaman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.)</p>
<p>In July, Ping won a $350,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to further develop these computational methods.</p>
<p>"We're developing a reliable set of tools to predict the electronic structure, excited-state lifetime, and quantum-state coherence time of defects in 2D materials at a quantum mechanical level," Ping said. "We do calculations from first principles, meaning we don't need any input from experiments. Everything is predicted based on quantum mechanics."</p>
<p><strong>Quantum weirdness</strong></p>
<p>The world of quantum mechanics is notoriously counter-intuitive and hard to grasp. Concepts such as superposition and entanglement defy common sense, yet they have been demonstrated conclusively and are fundamental to quantum information technologies. Superposition, when a particle exists in two different states simultaneously, is often compared to a spinning coin, neither heads nor tails until it stops spinning. Entanglement creates a link between the quantum states of two particles or qubits, so it is as if the outcome of one spinning coin determined the outcome of another spinning coin.</p>
<p>A major challenge in exploiting these phenomena for quantum information technologies is their inherent fragility. Interaction with the environment causes a superposition to fall into one state or the other. Called decoherence, this can be caused by vibrations of the atoms in the material and other subtle effects.</p>
<p>"You want qubits to be well insulated from the environment to give longer coherence times," Ping said.</p>
<p>One 2D material that has shown promise for quantum technologies is ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride. Ping used her computational methods to investigate various defects in this material and identified a promising candidate for scalable quantum applications. This defect (a nitrogen vacancy adjacent to carbon substitution of boron) is predicted to have stable spin states well insulated from the environment and bright optical transitions, making it a good source for single photon emission and a good candidate for qubits.</p>
<p>"Quantum emitters, which can emit one photon at a time, are important for optically-based quantum information processing, information security, and ultrasensitive sensing," Ping said.</p>
<p>She works closely with experimentalists, helping to interpret their results and guide their efforts to create novel materials with desirable properties for quantum technologies. Her group is part of a large collaborative effort, the <a href="https://qisenet.uchicago.edu/overview/">Quantum Information Science and Engineering Network</a> (QISE-NET), funded by the National Science Foundation. Tyler Smart, a graduate student in Ping's group, is funded by QISE-NET and is working on a project at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>"He will be traveling to Chicago to present his research every few months," Ping said. "There are about 20 universities as well as national laboratories and industry partners in the network, meeting regularly and sharing ideas, which is important because it's a fast-moving field."</p>
<p>One of the National Science Foundation's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/index.jsp">10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments</a> is "<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/quantum.jsp">The Quantum Leap: Leading the Next Quantum Revolution</a>." The Department of Energy is also investing in this area, as are companies such as Google and Intel, hoping to exploit quantum mechanics to develop next-generation technologies for computing, sensing, and communications.</p>
<p>"They are all investing in it because it will take a lot of effort to develop this field, and the potential is so great," Ping said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d3fa8a79807270173e9c65ae055e25cc"><name>sea-otter-touch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Decisive sea otters distinguish differences by touch</title><summary>Research at Long Marine Laboratory reveals the sensitivity of sea otters' paws and whiskers, as well as their ability to process tactile information rapidly.</summary><keywords>Colleen Reichmuth, Sarah McKay Strobel, Long Marine Lab</keywords><start-date>1537221600000</start-date><display-name>Decisive sea otters distinguish differences by touch</display-name><path>/2018/09/sea-otter-touch</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/sea-otter-touch</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1536859735704</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1537221252535</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Kathryn Knight (J.

Suspecting that sea otters do not rely on smell or vision to locate dinner in the cloudy waters of Monterey Bay, researchers at UC Santa Cruz wondered whether the dexterous creatures might depend instead on the sensitivity of their whiskers and paws to hunt by touch.</p>
<p>The researchers investigated this idea with the help of a young female sea otter named Selka, a temporary resident at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory after multiple strandings and rehabilitation by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The project was led by Sarah McKay Strobel, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology, and Colleen Reichmuth, director of the <a href="https://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/">Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory</a>.</p>
<p>Strobel is first author of a paper on their findings, published September 17 in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em>. Recalling the months of effort that went into preparing Selka for her starring role, she said, "Sea otters can sometimes be viewed as the 'problem child' when it comes to training."</p>
<p>Working with a large team of volunteer helpers, Strobel, Reichmuth, and postdoctoral researcher Jillian Sills trained Selka to approach a cabinet perched on the side of her pool, in which they concealed a pair of side-by-side vertically ridged boards, one with grooves 2 millimeters wide and a second with grooves 5 millimeters wide. Inserting her paw through a narrow slot into the cabinet, Selka touched both boards, and Strobel rewarded her whenever she pressed hard on the 2-mm board to produce a click, indicating that she had identified the correct board.</p>
<p>Once Selka had mastered the first comparison, the team trained her to identify the 2-mm grooves when offered a choice between that and 4-mm grooves, eventually completing seven more comparisons with progressively narrower grooves. The researchers also taught Selka to interrogate the boards with her whiskers, although Strobel admits that training her to wear a blindfold while nuzzling the boards was tricky.</p>
<p>"I knew that if I tried to do anything Selka wasn't ready for, I would very likely get bit. I had to make wearing the blindfold fun," Strobel said.</p>
<p>Having completed the training process in the air, the team then raised the water level in Selka's pool to inundate the cabinet and trained her to differentiate between the submerged boards.</p>
<p>After months of training, the team tested Selka's ability to distinguish the 2-mm grooved board from boards with grooves ranging from 2.1 to 3 millimeters wide. Tapping the pairs of boards with her paw, Selka seemed to recognize the 2-mm-wide ridges almost instantly if she encountered them first, depressing the board swiftly to make a click, but moved on quickly to the second board if the grooves were the wrong width.</p>
<p>Strobel said she was amazed by Selka's decisiveness, taking less than 0.2 seconds when using her paw and 0.4 seconds when exploring with her whiskers. In contrast, human volunteers who explored the boards with their fingertips were 30 times slower. It made no difference to Selka whether the boards were submerged or in the air.</p>
<p>Coauthor Tim Tinker used a novel statistical method to compare the change in Selka's accuracy as the difference between the grooves became narrower. He found that she could distinguish grooves that were 0.26 millimeters wider than the 2-mm groove with her paw, although her accuracy declined slightly when using her whiskers.</p>
<p>Sea otters consume prodigious amounts of prey, equal to about 25 percent of their own body weight every day. "They are eating machines," said Strobel, who suspects that the ability to make rapid decisions based on touch is essential for sea otters' survival.</p>

It hangs between Sir Radharishnan (the former president of India) and noted English judge William Blackstone.<br/><br/>The unveiling of the portrait was preceded by a conversation about diversity with Edward Mortimer, a senior editor of the <em>London Times</em> and former speech-writer for the late secretary-general of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Kofi Annan.&#160;The event was attended by more than 100 guests, including John Kufuor, the former president of Ghana, and Sam Gyimah, the British Minister for Higher Education<br/><br/>Born in Ghana in 1934, Abraham studied philosophy at the University of Ghana Legon, and then at Oxford, before returning to Ghana in 1962 at the request of Kwame Nkrumah, the president of Ghana. In 1966, Nkrumah was ousted in a military coup, and Abraham was imprisoned for nine months. He came to the United States in 1968 and eventually settled in California, joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty as a full philosophy professor in 1973. <br/><br/>&#8220;I was excited at the prospect&#160;of teaching at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Abraham recalled. &#8220;I had&#160;heard that the faculty&#160;were mostly distinguished&#160;refugees from other universities, who had vibrant ideas about the nature and methods of higher education. Even more attractive to me was the fact that it was harder to gain acceptance into UCSC than Berkeley, the crown jewel of the university system. That was both an opportunity and a challenge. I had taught at the University of Oxford, which was similarly highly selective.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;The physical campus was a wonder,&#8221; Abraham added. &#8220;I was already familiar with the college system from Oxford. The impression I had was that the builders cut down only those trees that they needed to in order to put up the buildings. I was taken by the ecological stewardship connoted in that. I felt a bonding with my students and cherished the general collegiality of my colleagues. I even turned down an offer from Northwestern University in my very first year at UC Santa Cruz. I am fortunate to have been able to spend the rest of my academic life in the environment and shelter of UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;<br/><br/>Abraham retired as a UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor of philosophy in 1994 and now lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/william_abraham.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/william_abraham.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>william_abraham.jpg</name><file-size>8906</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>William Abraham</thumb-alt><title>Emeritus  philosophy professor William Abraham</title><description>In 1959, UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor of philosophy William Abraham won a Prize Fellowship at Oxford University’s All Souls College—an award recognized by many as the ultimate post graduate achievement at the renowned institution. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e8563773807270173e9c65ae3143b500"><name>guthman-nsf</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NSF funds UC Santa Cruz study of tech in agriculture</title><summary>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz are leading a new, NSF-funded, multi-campus initiative to explore the intersection of agriculture, food, and technology.</summary><keywords>NSF, technology, agroecology, guthman, agriculture, high-tech, san francisco, innovation, entrepreneurship, capitalism, philanthropy, sustainability</keywords><start-date>1537167600000</start-date><display-name>Guthman-NSF</display-name><path>/2018/09/guthman-nsf</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/guthman-nsf</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1537201287925</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1537201444622</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/guthman-240-2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/guthman-240-2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-240-2.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-240-2.jpg</display-name><file-size>31526</file-size><width>240</width><height>337</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Julie Guthman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/guthman-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/guthman-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-80.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6676</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Julie Guthman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Julie Guthman, a professor of social sciences, above, and Madeleine Fairbairn, an assistant professor of environmental studies, will lead a multi-campus team investigating the intersection of agriculture, food, and technology.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>From smart phones and video games to personalized medicine, Silicon Valley has transformed communications, entertainment, and health care. So what does the global hub of technological innovation and entrepreneurship have to offer agriculture and food production?</p>
<p>That's the question on the minds of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who are leading a new multi-campus initiative to explore the intersection of agriculture, food, and technology.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has awarded a $492,000 grant to Julie Guthman, professor of social sciences at UC Santa Cruz, to fund her investigation of what Guthman calls the "agro-food tech sector."</p>
<p>"The San Francisco Bay Area is the hub of this sector, where tech innovators, venture capitalists, and philanthropists are joining forces to address some of the biggest challenges of agriculture and food production," said Guthman, a leading scholar of food movements who is known for her research on sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>The task of feeding a growing global population has never been more fraught as climate change, soil degradation, pesticide use, and other challenges threaten the sustainability of current agricultural systems&#8212;setting the stage for the emergence of this new sector and a host of tech-based solutions.</p>
<p>Guthman's colleague Madeleine Fairbairn, an assistant professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, will focus on agricultural technologies, particularly those related to data gathering.</p>
<p>"Entrepreneurs are championing everything from drones that monitor plant stress to lab-grown meat," said Guthman. "It's a revolutionary approach to food production and consumption."</p>
<p>Guthman will establish an inventory of the ideas that are being discussed, both in terms of food products and production, and the individual and institutional partnerships that are fueling&#8212;and funding&#8212;the agro-food tech movement. "This whole area is hot in terms of investment," she noted.</p>
<p>"The leaders are using the rhetoric of 'disruptive technology,' and positioning themselves as different from both the big players of chemical-intensive, industrial agriculture, as well as the smaller, back-to-the-land visionaries of organic or sustainable agriculture," said Guthman. "What collaborations are being forged among university scientists, venture capitalists, foundations, and others? This is where high-tech meets ag and food."</p>
<p>Guthman has attended several "meetups" where ambitious entrepreneurs float novel solutions. Some proposals appear to push the limits of credibility or public acceptance, such as insect-rich cookies or algae-based "shrimp" and other novel food products designed to meet the global demand for protein.</p>
<p>"Now that agro-food has caught the tech sector's eye, this region has become a hub of agro-food innovation," said Guthman. "This could be the future of food and agriculture, and we need to be paying attention."</p>
<p>In addition to Fairbairn, Guthman will be joined on the three-year project by Kathryn De Master, an assistant professor of agriculture, society, and the environment at UC Berkeley; and Charlotte Biltekoff, associate professor of American studies and food science and technology at UC Davis.</p>

<p>Please take the time to <a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/planning/EnvDoc.html#shw">study the revised report</a>, to review the project, and to weigh in by providing your feedback and comments. Student Housing West is crucial to the future of our university. It will give us more than 3,000 new on-campus beds, which we believe will pull upper-division students now in the local housing market back to campus, helping them while also easing pressure on the greater local housing market. The project will expand much-needed child care, offering to faculty and staff what is now only available to students. It will also allow us to ease overcrowding in existing dorms, and to restore some of the lounge space we have converted to sleeping space in recent years to meet serious need.</p>
<p>I recognize Student Housing West faces opposition for a variety reasons. The majority of the project is slated for the current site of Family Student Housing, on Heller Drive. The proposal calls for buildings taller and larger than those that are there now. Also, a small portion of the project is proposed for the base of the East Meadow, and some believe that area of campus should remain untouched.</p>
<p>But I strongly believe the proposed project is the right project, at the right time. California is in the grips of an unprecedented housing crisis. In our own community, there is a general lack of housing, and what is available is prohibitively expensive. Student Housing West is a bold attempt to help our current students, too many of whom are struggling to get by in this overheated housing market.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, because of concerns from our community, I extended the public comment period on the project&#8217;s first draft EIR. The extended comment period allowed project supporters and opponents more time and opportunities to weigh in and to offer project alternatives the initial draft EIR did not cover. I can say with good conscience that we thoroughly examined every alternative put forth.</p>
<p>I believe the end result is an economically prudent project that will maintain housing affordability for all students, mitigate environmental impacts to the extent they can be lessened, and minimize the displacement of students with families while construction is underway.</p>
<p>We live and work in stunning natural surroundings, and building anywhere on our iconic campus is a tightrope walk. Faculty, staff, alumni, students, and campus supporters, past and present, have very strong feelings about what should be built on campus and where. I respect those opinions.</p>
<p>We must remember, though, that we are also a university of people. We have a growing, increasingly diverse student body. While we remain committed to respecting our unique landscape, we must also help our students confront the very real, immediate challenges they face, particularly in regard to housing. Student Housing West is our attempt at doing that, and I believe it is a worthy project deserving of support.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e86d3cbe807270173e9c65aeb189eae8"><name>exciting-times-sap</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Exciting times ahead for Strategic Academic Plan</title><summary>Our community’s truly insightful and innovative work has led us forward in strategic academic planning, and the astute insights and feedback will continue to shape both SAP and the future of this university.

<p>We write today to provide an update on the&#160;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19uMNU2WhF_reFSc3_R8vxopl63e8udwM">three elements of the draft plan (PDF)</a>, and the evolving implementation plan.</p>
<p><strong>Barrier Reduction.</strong>&#160;Our community was clear about the need to reduce internal obstacles to our innovative work. We are committed to tackling the areas you identified as barriers. Work launches this fall on two of the&#160;<a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/barrier-reduction/">10 high-priority barriers:</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce team-teaching difficulties.</li>
<li>Improving grant proposal procedures and faculty/researcher support from the Office of Sponsored Projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>We remain committed to working on all the barriers over the next several years.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Priority Areas.</strong>&#160;The three academic priority areas are at the core of how we will focus our academic renewal and growth, and will be one way to help a broader audience understand UCSC. We will grow our faculty around the academic priority areas and in other areas of need through requests made by our deans. There will be opportunities for funding other initiatives related to APAs as well. Finally, we have worked with our colleagues to develop detailed descriptions of these APAs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/#earthfutures">Earth Futures</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/#justice">Justice in a Changing World</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/#digitalinterventions">Digital Interventions</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Design Principles.</strong>&#160;We are awaiting feedback from our Academic Senate and other campus academic leadership on our proposed design principles, and how they should be prioritized. We anticipate a broader conversation this year with faculty, staff, and students on how best to define and embody these principles and implement our vision.</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive research and creative work that transform our world.</li>
<li>Create enriching experiential learning and research opportunities for students.</li>
<li>Engage and support a diverse faculty, staff, and student body.</li>
<li>Support generative interdisciplinary connections to research and teaching.</li>
<li>Expand excellence in innovation in areas distinctive to UC Santa Cruz, such as social justice, diversity, and sustainability.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Caf&#233; SAP: Save the Date!</strong>&#160;VPAA Lee will host pop-up office hours for faculty, staff, and students to discuss the SAP. The first will be 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 10, at the Music Center patio. Monthly pop-ups will move around campus. Our Coastal Science Campus and Scotts Valley location also will host pop-ups. Dates and locations will be shared as they become available. I plan to join Herbie on occasion to hear directly from the campus community. We invite all who are interested to come, to ask questions, or to simply share thoughts and comments.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e86e43af807270173e9c65ae87d10ed6"><name>student-housing-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>With changes to Student Housing West, campus revises draft environmental review</title><summary>Though UC Santa Cruz provides housing for 9,300 students—roughly half of its student body—there remains an urgent need for affordable campus housing, especially for upper-division students who otherwise would be living in the surrounding community.

<p>Earlier this year, UC Santa Cruz prepared and circulated a draft environmental impact report (EIR) for the project. After receiving more than 350 comments on the draft EIR, UC Santa Cruz has made a number of changes to the project, provided additional analysis and discussion, and evaluated additional alternatives suggested by members of the public.</p>
<p>The revised draft EIR is <a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/planning/EnvDoc.html">available online</a> and will undergo a 45-day public review, which ends at 5 p.m. Nov. 1. Two public hearings are scheduled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oct. 23, from 6:30-8:30 p.m., at Louden Nelson Community Center, 301 Center St.</li>
<li>Oct. 24, from 5-7 p.m., at Kresge Town Hall</li>
</ul>
<p>Though UC Santa Cruz provides housing for 9,300 students&#8212;roughly half of its student body&#8212;there remains an urgent need for affordable campus housing, especially for upper-division students who otherwise would be living in the surrounding community. Student Housing West is the single largest housing project underway in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our students and our community desperately need more housing, and Student Housing West will provide it,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;This project will benefit students by enabling them to live on campus, at the same time opening up some of the housing in Santa Cruz that is currently filled by students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the revised proposal, Student Housing West will create 3,072 new beds at two sites on the UC Santa Cruz main campus, one along Heller Drive, the other along Hagar Drive.</p>
<p>The first comment period, originally 45 days, then extended an additional 45 days or so, generated more than 350 comments. UC Santa Cruz made a number of changes to the project in response to the feedback and also considered additional alternatives as suggested by members of the public.</p>
<p>The height of buildings has been reduced at the Heller site, which will provide housing for over 2,900 upper-division undergraduates and graduate students across six buildings. This was achieved by revisiting the design of unit configurations to allow for a higher level of density while also developing a new unit type that is more affordable for our students.</p>
<p>Two of the undergraduate buildings along the western edge are now planned to be seven stories tall. They were first proposed to be eight to 10. Two of the other undergraduate buildings at the Heller site will vary from five to six stories, down from five to seven in the original proposal, while the last undergraduate building will remain at five to seven stories. The two graduate buildings at the southern end of the Heller site will be five to six stories.</p>
<p>As indicated earlier, a new unit configuration was also developed based on feedback from undergraduate and graduate students who sought increased co-housing configurations with shared kitchens and living rooms. The new configuration provides a higher level of affordability.</p>
<p>The project will continue to include a student hub with retail space, a fitness room, multipurpose space, meeting rooms, and more.</p>
<p>The Hagar site will create 140 new housing units for students with families, as well as an expanded child-care center that will serve the children of faculty, staff, and students. The children of students are currently the only children eligible for care.</p>
<p>The Hagar location was selected for several reasons, including its proximity to existing employee housing, the main campus entrance, and Westlake Elementary School.</p>
<p>A revised grading plan for the site has also benefited the Hagar location by reducing the visible height of some buildings along Hagar and Coolidge Drives. The campus is also taking a revised approach to stormwater management to mitigate potential impacts to Kalkar Pond, off Spring Street.</p>
<p>Following the original public comment period, UC Santa Cruz is analyzing other alternatives to the project proposed by the public to determine if they could meet the project objectives, which include supporting the student experience and keeping the housing affordable.</p>
<p>The pairing of the Hagar and Heller sites remained the best proposed approach, Blumenthal said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate everyone&#8217;s interest in this project, and I believe it is better for all the feedback we received,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;We looked closely at every idea put forth. At this point in the process, we believe the proposal to build at the Hager site will best serve our current and future students. The proposed project design minimizes the environmental impact and will allow us to keep our campus housing costs down.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to receiving the public's comments and feedback to determine what we will be recommending to the UC Regents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campus plans to take Student Housing West to the UC Board of Regents for approval in January 2019.</p>
<p>The goal is to open the new community for family student housing in spring 2020, and to begin opening new buildings at Heller Drive in fall 2022 with full project completion by fall 2023.</p>

University Housing will open its doors for occupancy beginning Thursday, Sept. 20 and student Move-In will continue through Sunday, Sept. 23.</p>
<p>This is an exciting period for our students and their families and an excellent opportunity for us to welcome them to our university and community. However, residential Move-In has impacts on campus parking and traffic and we ask for your patience and flexibility.</p>
<p>We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus for the Move-In period. This creates a significant challenge for the campus community, particularly on Friday. Principal officers and managers are encouraged to consider alternative work sites for staff members at the discretion of the supervisor, if operationally feasible. Additionally, we strongly encourage the use of alternative commute options to get to and from campus (such as sharing a ride or utilizing public transportation, such as&#160;<a href="https://www.scmtd.com/en">Santa Cruz Metro</a>&#160;bus service) to help accommodate the Move-In traffic. That being said, it is important to note the following restrictions and alternative parking options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many of the parking lots near colleges and both remote lots will be restricted on different days during Move-In.</strong>&#160;For additional details regarding traffic patterns, access and restricted parking lots, please check the maps below&#160;(maps are subject to change up to each Move-In date):<br/><br/><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/9-20-18.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Thursday 9/20</a><br/><br/><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/9-21-18.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Friday 9/21</a><br/><br/><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/9-22-18.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Saturday 9/22</a><br/><br/><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/9-23-18.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Sunday 9/23<br/></a></li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicles without a valid Move-In permit will be cited if they park in restricted lots or specially reserved spaces.</strong>&#160;(Vehicles with valid disability-related permits or placards are the exception to this rule.)<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Because of these restrictions, those with A, B, C or R permits may need to find alternative parking.</strong>&#160;Please check the day-specific maps above for non-restricted parking options. Individuals possessing permits normally valid in remote parking lots will be able to park in&#160;East Remote Overflow Lots 4 and 5&#160;during Move-In.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>One-way traffic controls will be in place on Porter-Kresge Road on each day of Move-In.</strong>&#160;Traffic will only be allowed to go from Kresge to Porter; no traffic will be allowed to drive into the Porter entrance from Heller Drive. Those needing to access Porter must enter through Kresge.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Cowell and Stevenson Service Roads: One-way traffic only.</strong> &#160;Cowell and Stevenson Service Roads will be one-way traffic only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Access to the area will be from Cowell Service Road on Hagar (near the Cowell Provost House) only; traffic will exit onto the Cowell-Stevenson Road near the Stevenson Circle.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>From Friday through Sunday, Hagar Drive will be closed to downhill traffic at McLaughlin Drive.</strong>&#160;Drivers are asked to use southbound Coolidge Drive (overlooking the Pogonip) as an alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s important to note that, in addition to Move-In traffic, the roads leading to and from campus may be affected by school release times Thursday and Friday afternoons, the&#160;<a href="https://www.santacruztriathlon.org/olympic">Santa Cruz Triathlon</a>&#160;on Saturday, road work along Bay Drive and typical visitor traffic over the entire weekend.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Dave Keller, Executive Director, Housing Services and Larry Pageler, Director, Transportation and Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e9f02b27807270173e9c65ae1890951f"><name>canvas-fall-2018</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Canvas for Fall 2018</title><summary>Fall quarter is just around the corner.

<p>The policy was revised to provide an updated security framework that protects UC&#8217;s institutional information/data and IT resources from accidental or intentional unauthorized access, loss or damage. It follows both a standards- and risk-based approach to information security.</p>
<p>The policy now recognizes a set of best practices and security controls that are crucial for UC to:</p>

<li>obtain cybersecurity insurance</li>
<li>ensure faculty are eligible for certain federal research/grant</li>

Yet just down the highway from UC Santa Cruz, numerous communities in the Salinas Valley Basin lack access to affordable clean water.</p>
<p>In a new model of community engagement, Environmental Studies faculty are harnessing the talent of graduate students to help change that.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Elliott Campbell and Professor Chris Benner co-taught a Spring Quarter class to connect first-year graduate students with environmental problems in the region and to foster collaboration with off-campus stakeholders. Water in the Salinas Valley Basin is a persistent problem, and students examined the history and politics of who gets access to clean water, as well as the human impacts of inequities in the system.</p>
<p>"This isn't just homework, it's dealing with real problems," said Campbell, the Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food Sustainability, who will co-teach the course, "Environmental Studies in Practice," again next winter. "This is our way of building a longer-term commitment to community stakeholders."</p>
<p>Students tackled the role of the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (SVBGWSA); how the delivery of safe drinking water to disadvantaged communities is governed; and the water and energy demands of strawberry production. By the end of the quarter, each team produced a report and gave a public presentation based on their research and community interactions.</p>
<p>By all accounts, it was a demanding, eye-opening, at times heart wrenching, deep dive into California water politics.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>A changing landscape for water in California</strong></p>
<p>To explore and understand the forces shaping access to water for disadvantaged communities&#8212;a formal designation for areas that suffer from a combination of economic, health, and environmental burdens, Campbell and Benner renewed ties with members of the San Jerardo Housing Cooperative, a farmworker community southeast of Salinas that has struggled for almost 30 years to get clean water. In 2006, UCSC environmental studies undergraduates partnered with residents to document the health impacts of groundwater pollution in the&#160;cooperative.</p>
<p>About 250 people live in the cooperative, which was built to house farm workers who came to the U.S. from Mexico as part of the Bracero program. Fertilizer used on the surrounding fields has created nitrates that have contaminated one well after another. Polluted water has been linked to rashes and skin problems, including hair loss.</p>
<p>The newest well, installed by Monterey County in 2010, pumps clean water from two miles away, but the relatively small number of residents must bear the entire cost of the system. Some families pay $100 per month, while others still don't trust the well water and choose instead to buy bottled water.</p>
<p>Horacio Amezquita, the general manager of San Jerardo, would like to see the county turn over operation of the water system to the cooperative, which he believes could run it more affordably.</p>
<p>And San Jerardo is not alone. Dozens of California communities, most of them low-income and predominantly Latino, are coping with water supplies that don't meet current quality standards for drinking water. They truck in water or rely on expensive bottled water, said Campbell.</p>
<p>A new landmark state law mandates the "sustainable" use of all aquifers in California, stipulating that users can't take out more water than accumulates naturally&#8212;a challenge for the critically overdrafted Salinas Basin.</p>
<p>Across the state, local jurisdictions are establishing new agencies to oversee decision making and the distribution of this contested resource, with representation from urban and rural water users, nonprofits, industry, disadvantaged communities, and others.</p>
<p>This landscape put issues of environmental justice at the center of the research, which is something the Environmental Studies Department wants to do, noted Benner, an urban political economist and director of the Everett Program for Technology and Social Change. And the community-engaged research approach recognizes that there are many "ways of knowing and learning about issues," he said. "Scientific knowledge has a certain privileged power, but it also has blinders and limitations. Community-engaged research makes those connections." The resulting projects were remarkably creative and interdisciplinary, blending quantitative and qualitative research, he said.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Documenting decades of struggle</strong></p>
<p>The three-student team that focused on water governance built a web-based "<a href="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1mJSBLJJN1Ovg23rmEsm935QYPq8MpQX-5Av08mrY490&amp;font=Default&amp;lang=en&amp;initial_zoom=2&amp;height=650">timeline</a>" to document what San Jerardo residents have gone through over the decades in their struggle to get access to clean drinking water. Most recently, the cooperative has petitioned the State Water Board to gain control of their water system, but it's unclear if San Jerardo can meet the board's requirements for reserve funds.</p>
<p>Doctoral student Azucena Lucatero was part of the timeline team, and she found herself drawn to the community's story. "This was my first exposure to community-engaged research," she said. "We wanted to use our position as student researchers with a bit of a platform through this class to do what we could to help them continue their struggle."</p>
<p>Her team developed the timeline because they wanted to build the community's capacity to continue documenting their struggle. "Storytelling is a huge part of how they've gotten outside resources, mobilized outside organizations, and gotten legislators to act on the issue," she said.</p>
<p>Based on extensive interviews and archival research, the San Jerardo case study stands as a model for many other communities, said Campbell.</p>

<figcaption><em>"This isn't just homework, it's dealing with real problems," said Elliott Campbell, the Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food Sustainability. "This is our way of building a longer-term commitment to community stakeholders."</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Many of these communities are invisible to the general public, so documenting this in a public way increases their visibility," he said. It also highlights some of the factors that set San Jerardo apart from other communities, including having an engaged, bilingual general manager and nonprofit partners that have connected the cooperative to resources such as grants and journalists. Amezquita has lived at San Jerardo since 1979 and was an active partner with the graduate students.</p>
<p>"Some of these communities haven't had clean drinking water since the 1980s," said doctoral student Allyson Makuch, who also worked on the timeline. "Women are having miscarriages from carrying 5-gallon bottles of water."</p>
<p>The pace of the 10-week course was demanding, and the focus on San Jerardo stoked a desire to make an "actual contribution," said Makuch, who was drawn to UCSC's Ph.D. program in part because of its interdisciplinary approach. "UCSC is interdisciplinary, with a strong social justice mission and a commitment to community-engaged research," she said.</p>
<p>Lucatero described her "visceral, emotional response" to seeing people struggling, and her subsequent discovery of the "language, tools, and codified methods" of community-engaged research (CER). After the course ended, Lucatero attended a weeklong CER <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/CERI/">institute</a> sponsored by the <a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/">Everett Program</a>, and the two experiences have secured her desire to learn more.</p>
<p>"San Jerardo is like the community where I grew up in Southern California," she said. "That's kind of why I want to do community-engaged research, to serve my community.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Power and influence, and strawberries</strong></p>
<p>Water is a precious commodity across California, but the Salinas Valley is particularly hard hit, because agriculture extracts 95 percent of the groundwater in the area. The new state mandate for sustainable aquifer management pits the heavyweight agricultural industry against the needs of disadvantaged communities. The second group of graduate students examined "power and influence" within the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (SVBGSA), considering the interests that were represented and "following the money" to see how funding influences decision making. Not surprisingly, they identified agriculture's strong influence over the agency's decisions, which the group found were "unequally focused on water quantity over any other aspect of sustainable groundwater management."</p>
<p>The third group of students did a case study of the "food-water-energy nexus" of the strawberry industry in the Salinas Valley. Despite its unstable water supply, California produces about 90 percent of the nation's strawberries, an industry valued at more than $2 billion. The group considered the energy costs of pumping water to farms for irrigation and of transporting berries from fields to markets, as well as the water used to make fertilizers. This "life cycle" approach to resource use presents a more comprehensive picture of water use, as well as environmental impacts such as the production of greenhouse gas emissions, and it should be used in any attempt to sustainably manage state water resources, they concluded.</p>
<p>The spring class culminated with student presentations in the Monterey County Offices in Salinas that were attended by members of the SVBGSA, the general manager of the board, and technical advisers. Acknowledging that the reports were critical of many of the agency's current policies and practices, Lucatero said being a graduate student made it easier to "speak truth to power," because she doesn't anticipate interacting with the officials again. It was harder to say goodbye to San Jerardo and return to her own research program, which is focused on insect biodiversity in urban gardens.</p>
<p>"You have to balance your own interests with the needs of the community," she said. "Ten weeks is very, very short. We did the best we could. I hope it does help."</p>

</figure>
<p>Horacio Amezquita, manager of the San Jerardo Cooperative, said the students did an "amazing job delivering their message to the new Groundwater Sustainability Agency." Representatives of the agriculture industry were skeptical of some aspects of the reports, but the message about the decades-long struggles of disadvantaged communities to get clean water came across loud and clear, he said. "A lot of disadvantaged communities don't have clean water," Amezquita added. "They've been left behind. No one is helping them get access to clean wells that would provide clean water to their homes."</p>
<p><strong>Partnering with community stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>To ensure continuity and ongoing support for San Jerardo, Campbell will work with the same stakeholders next year: the San Jerardo Cooperative, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency, and others. Campbell will co-teach the class again next winter, teaming up with Brent Haddad, a professor of environmental studies who specializes in water issues and directs the <a href="https://ciwr.ucsc.edu/">Center for Integrated Water Research</a>.</p>
<p>"We'll have a new cohort of graduate students," said Campbell. "Projects will be student-driven, with instructor expertise, but they'll pick their own research questions."</p>
<p>This approach to graduate education&#8212;integrating community-engaged research into the first-year experience&#8212;is challenging. It introduces students to theory and methodologies that may lie outside their expertise or research interests, and the pace is swift. Collaborating with stakeholders outside academia can be difficult, and this level of personal involvement may be new for some. But it is part of the full portfolio of research skills that support a diverse range of career goals, said Lori Kletzer, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies.</p>
<p>"Training our students in community-engaged scholarship is valuable for those who are interested in academia, as well as those who plan to work in government, nonprofits, NGOs, policy, and advocacy,&#8221; said Kletzer. "This type of collaboration is a terrific complement to the interdisciplinary nature of environmental studies. It further distinguishes our graduates as they pursue their careers."</p>
<p>It is also part of the public-service mission of the University of California, noted Campbell, adding, "As a public research university, we have a commitment to serve the people of this state."</p>

I have decided that the time is right for me to step aside and allow someone else to assume the leadership of this remarkable institution.</p>
<p>It has been a great personal and professional honor to serve as the 10th chancellor of UC Santa Cruz. I am tremendously proud of the strides we have made over the past dozen years in advancing diversity, encouraging philanthropy, enhancing town-gown cooperation, and improving the academic standing of the campus.</p>
<p>We have swung open the doors of opportunity at UC Santa Cruz: The number of undergraduates from underrepresented minority groups has nearly doubled over the past decade. The percentage of entering frosh who are first-generation college students &#8212; the first in their families to seek a four-year degree &#8212; now regularly tops 40 percent. We are literally changing the lives of thousands of students, their families, and their communities.</p>
<p>Importantly, we have established a culture of philanthropy on campus that will serve us immeasurably moving forward. In 2013, we launched our first-ever comprehensive fundraising campaign. The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, which we wrapped up six months early, raised more than $335 million, surpassing our loftiest goal.</p>
<p>In 2008, we entered a new era of improved town-gown relations, which I sincerely hope will continue. Ten years ago we signed a historic agreement with the city and county of Santa Cruz, as well as with neighborhood groups, resolving longstanding litigation over water, housing, and traffic issues. This agreement has served as a model for universities and communities nationwide. Keeping this relationship strong serves all parties.</p>
<p>The colleges are a hallmark of our university, and we have renovated and expanded Porter and Merrill colleges, and are now on the cusp of a Kresge revitalization. We have added nearly 260,000 square feet of new space across campus. UCSC opened a satellite campus in the heart of Silicon Valley and a new facility in Scotts Valley for hundreds of our staff. We also have invested in our Coastal Science Campus with a state-of-the-art coastal biology facility.</p>
<p>In the past dozen years, the campus has significantly grown undergraduate and graduate programs in a wide range of disciplines. Our research funding has soared, thereby enabling the great minds we have on campus to do what they do best: pioneer innovative approaches in a host of fields and push the envelopes of knowledge.</p>
<p>Our academic reputation has climbed alongside this expansion. This past year UCSC ranked third in the world for research impact, grouped with MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley. Earlier this month we were named among the top 30 public universities in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report. I am tremendously proud of the outstanding endeavors by faculty, staff, and students that have enabled us to reach these academic heights.</p>
<p>I consider the 12 years I have spent as chancellor &#8212; it will be a lucky 13 when all is said and done &#8212; to be among the most fulfilling of my professional life. This university is filled with people eager to make a difference, change paradigms, and challenge conventional ways of doing things. That is what makes UC Santa Cruz the dynamic place it is and always has been. It has been thrilling to be a part of that mission since 1972, when I arrived on campus as an assistant professor, eager to help shape the future of a still-young university.</p>
<p>Now it feels like the right time to pass the reins. Our new Strategic Academic Plan is in place, and I sense the same energy on campus that I felt when I first arrived &#8212; a feeling that our future is limitless, and that we are on the precipice of remarkable change. I believe a new campus leader should help chart our next steps.</p>
<p>A national search for my successor will begin immediately, organized by the Office of the President. While I will officially retire when I step down, I plan to remain on campus, teaching and writing, and volunteering in ways that will help the University of California, which has given so much to me.</p>
<p>I offer my heartfelt gratitude to all for giving me the opportunity to lead such an outstanding campus. In particular, I would like to thank my wife, Kelly Weisberg, and my family for their support in this adventure. No one succeeds in this job alone!</p>

While I wish him the very best, I want to acknowledge this news as bittersweet for the Santa Cruz campus, the larger UC community and for me, personally.</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal has led the Santa Cruz campus for more than 12 years with an unstinting passion for the university&#8217;s public mission and core values. As UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 10th chancellor, he has greatly expanded opportunities and access for underrepresented and low-income students and increased both the size and the academic scope of the campus.</p>
<p>He arrived in Santa Cruz in 1972 as a faculty member in astronomy and astrophysics and served for many years as a distinguished professor, researcher and campus leader. He has also served the university on a systemwide level as chair of the UC Academic Senate and faculty representative to the UC Board of Regents.</p>
<p>The list of George&#8217;s accomplishments, far too numerous to list here, is a testament to his devotion to a life of learning, teaching and public service. In all his endeavors at the university, he has demonstrated his sharp intellect, deep engagement, curiosity and wit.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, I intend to convene a <a href="http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/7102.html">committee</a> to conduct a national search to find a new chancellor for the dynamic and beautiful Santa Cruz campus, which deserves and demands the best leadership possible.</p>
<p>I congratulate George on his announcement of new life opportunities and offer my profound gratitude and thanks for his remarkable service to the University of California. I wish him and his wife, UC Hastings law professor Kelly Weisberg, all the best.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f2bee98d807270173e9c65ae232aeea5"><name>revised-smoke-and-tobacco-free-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus review of the revised Smoke and Tobacco Free Environment Policy</title><summary>In response to recent revisions to the UC Office of the President Smoke and Tobacco Free Environment policy as well as campus feedback, Business and Administrative Services is proposing updates to the UC Santa Cruz Smoke and Tobacco Free Environment policy and invites your comments.</summary><start-date>1537372800000</start-date><display-name>Campus review of the revised Smoke and Tobacco Free Environment Policy</display-name><path>/2018/09/revised-smoke-and-tobacco-free-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/revised-smoke-and-tobacco-free-policy</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1537375922529</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1537571509022</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In response to recent revisions to the UC Office of the President Smoke and Tobacco Free Environment policy as well as campus feedback, Business and Administrative Services is proposing updates to the UC Santa Cruz Smoke and Tobacco Free Environment policy and invites your comments.</p>

<p>Nimmo was honored at an award ceremony on September 19 at the European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC) 2018 in Berlin, Germany. The ceremony included a lecture by Nimmo on the satellite systems of giant planets.</p>
<p>The annual prize, established in 2010 to honor the memory of Italian scientist Paolo Farinella (1953&#8208;2000), acknowledges an outstanding researcher not older than 47 years (the age of Farinella when he passed away) who has achieved important results in one of Farinella&#8217;s fields of work. Each year the prize focuses on a different research area. In 2018, it was devoted to the satellite systems of giant planets, their geology, geophysics, and orbital evolution.</p>
<p>Nimmo has made significant contributions to the understanding of the internal structure and evolution of icy bodies of the solar system and the resulting influence on their surface processes. He has investigated the internal processes that affect plume activity at Enceladus&#8217; southern polar region, suggesting that shear heating is at the origin of the plumes and heat flux on this moon of Saturn. He has also studied other moons of giant planets, including Europa, Ganymede, Titan, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Triton, and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Francis Nimmo has shown an excellent ability to combine geologic observations with geophysics and orbital dynamics to clarify the formation and evolution of icy satellites,&#8221; said David Lucchesi, a member of the organizing committee of the Farinella Prize. &#8220;His outstanding publication record contains over 180 peer-reviewed papers, and these have been very well received by the community as shown by the extraordinary number of citations. For these reasons, Professor Nimmo is well deserving the 2018 Farinella Prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his remarks before receiving the prize, Nimmo said, &#8220;I never had the privilege of meeting Paolo Farinella, but I know we shared a deep interest in the origin and dynamics of outer Solar System bodies, like Pluto and Triton. These bodies are interesting and complicated because their orbits affect their interiors, and their interiors affect their orbits. It is precisely this feature that leads my work: I make inferences about the interiors and evolution of solar system bodies using geological and geophysical techniques, and then try to draw dynamical conclusions. My approach is quite different from Professor Farinella&#8217;s and most of the previous recipients of the award, so I am even more proud of winning the prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nimmo earned his B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from St John&#8217;s College, Cambridge University, UK. He has worked at the California Institute of Technology, University College London, and UCLA. He joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2005.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f7e5afd680727017599ca6dc148d504e"><name>geotraces-cruise</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ocean scientist Phoebe Lam leads Pacific Ocean research cruise </title><summary>Lam is one of three chief scientists on the U.S. GEOTRACES GP15 cruise to sample the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Tahiti.</summary><keywords>Phoebe Lam, GEOTRACES</keywords><start-date>1537426800000</start-date><display-name>Ocean scientist Phoebe Lam leads Pacific Ocean research cruise </display-name><path>/2018/09/geotraces-cruise</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/geotraces-cruise</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1537462348768</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1537462580250</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/rrevelle-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/rrevelle-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rrevelle-400.jpg</name><display-name>rrevelle-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>51758</file-size><width>400</width><height>290</height></image><image-alt>R/V Roger Revelle in port</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/phoebe-lam-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/phoebe-lam-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>phoebe-lam-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>phoebe-lam-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18635</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Phoebe Lam</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The 277-foot R/V <em>Roger Revelle</em> is the home, laboratory, and transportation for the 59 scientists and crew studying ocean chemistry between Alaska and Tahiti.

Some trace elements (mercury, for example) are also of concern as contaminants, while others, together with a diverse array of isotopes, are used by scientists to study ocean processes and the role of the ocean in climate change.</p>
<p>An international program called <a href="http://www.geotraces.org/">GEOTRACES</a> aims to improve the understanding of trace elements and their isotopes in the marine environment, including their large-scale distribution and how they cycle through biological, geological, and chemical processes.</p>
<p>Phoebe Lam, associate professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, is a chief scientist on the <a href="https://geotraces-gp15.com/">U.S. GEOTRACES GP15</a> cruise, which will be studying the Pacific Ocean along a line of longitude (152&#176; W) from Alaska to Tahiti from September 18 to November 24. This is the fourth U.S. GEOTRACES cruise, and Lam's lab has been involved in all of them. This time, she is participating both as a chief scientist helping to coordinate the whole operation and as a principal investigator overseeing her lab's research project.</p>
<p>"The GEOTRACES cruises have really revolutionized our understanding of trace elements," she said. "It's a huge operation. I'm one of three cruise leaders, and there are over 26 research groups to coordinate."</p>
<p>Joining the scientists and crew as the shipboard science communicator will be Alex Fox, who graduated in June from the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://scicom.ucsc.edu/">Science Communication Program</a>. Fox will be writing blog posts for the cruise <a href="https://geotraces-gp15.com/">web site</a> and posting on social media throughout the cruise.</p>
<p>This cruise will support a large variety of individual science projects to study the chemical and biological interactions of trace elements, with some research being conducted on board the ship by the 45 participants, and additional research to be done at participating academic laboratories across the country.</p>
<p>"The oceans are so under-sampled we discover new features on each cruise that force us to reconsider what we think we know about the chemistry of the oceans," Lam said.</p>
<p>Lam's lab focuses on measuring particles in the water column and studying their role in the cycling of trace elements. She will be in charge of a pumping system that will be deployed from the ship to filter large volumes of sea water and collect particles of different sizes. The samples collected by the pumping system will be distributed among 16 different research groups.</p>
<p>"What's exciting about GEOTRACES is that we're all sampling the same waters and measuring different things, so it becomes a really rich data set," Lam said. "The same ocean processes have to explain all our observations, so after the cruise when we have workshops and start to put it all together, that's the really fun part."</p>
<p>The other chief scientists on the cruise are Karen Casciotti at Stanford University and Greg Cutter at Old Dominion University. The ship, the R/V <em>Roger Revelle</em>, departed from Seattle on September 18, headed for Kodiak, Alaska. It will make one stop in Hilo, Hawaii, before the expedition ends at Papeete, Tahiti. This research is funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>

<p>The process took approximately eight months, which included interviews, evidence review, and more. Through this time, the professor was on leave. We strive to respond to allegations in a timely manner, but some cases do take longer to investigate. This situation involved several complainants and incidents over several years, which led to a longer timeframe for the investigation.</p>
<p>Allegations against the professor first emerged on or about March 2017 through anonymous graffiti in campus restrooms. However, it was not until people came forward to report their experiences and were willing to participate in an investigation that our Title IX Office was able to initiate an investigation.</p>
<h3>What happens now?</h3>
<p>The University of California has a clear procedure for responding to allegations of sexual misconduct by tenured faculty. After an investigation has found that the policy was violated, the investigation goes to the chancellor (or designee) who then engages the Peer Review Committee for advise on appropriate outcomes. The chancellor (or designee) also provides the parties an opportunity to express their perspective and desired outcomes. The chancellor (or designee) then makes a decision of how to proceed after reviewing the investigation report, the recommendations from the committee and any response from the parties involved.</p>
<p>From there, a case can go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early resolution, which can include disciplinary measures, and requires the respondent to accept the terms.</li>
<li>A disciplinary process</li>
<li>No formal discipline</li>
</ul>
<p>If the chancellor (or designee) initiates a disciplinary process, then the chancellor (or designee) files charges with the Academic Senate&#8217;s Committee on Privilege and Tenure.</p>
<p>Senate Privilege &amp; Tenure Committee conducts a hearing, then makes a recommendation to the chancellor regarding discipline. The chancellor (or designee) makes the final determination of discipline. The complainant and the respondent are notified of the outcome.</p>

<p>Reports involving non-Title IX allegations of misconduct have been provided to the campus provost/executive vice chancellor (CPEVC) for review and action consistent with the policy requirement of CAPM 002.015, which includes forwarding the matter to the Committee on Charges. The Committee on Charges advises the campus provost on a number of issues, which may include a recommendation on proposed discipline. <br/><br/>The CPEVC makes the determination whether to initiate disciplinary action. To initiate such action, the CPEVC issues a notice of charges and proposed discipline to both the faculty respondent and the the Academic Senate Committee on Privilege and Tenure. If the faculty respondent does not accept the disciplinary sanction(s) proposed by the CPEVC, the Committee on Privilege and Tenure will conduct a hearing and make a recommendation to Chancellor Blumenthal in accordance with Academic Senate Bylaw 336.</p>
<h3>Is the professor still on leave?</h3>
<p>Yes, the professor continues to be on leave.</p>
<h3>How will the campus prevent something like this from happening again?</h3>
<p>Sexual violence and sexual harassment has no place at UC Santa Cruz. We applaud the bravery of those who are willing to come forward to report incidents and participate in the process and ultimately help make our campus safer for everyone.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone in our community to report sexual misconduct to our <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu">Title IX Office</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to implementing policy improvements, UC Santa Cruz launched <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond-compliance/">Beyond Compliance</a>, an ambitious initiative to help change campus culture by engaging faculty members with the goal of creating an environment free from sexual violence and sexual harassment. The initiative last year announced a three-year campaign that focuses on faculty education, participation, and leadership.</p>
<p>The CP/EVC&#8217;s office will be hosting a town hall meeting with Title IX, CARE, Beyond Compliance and other partners in mid-October.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fd34278d80727017599ca6dcb9fcb55e"><name>proposed-revisions-sexual-harassment-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proposed revisions to the UC Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy</title><summary>The Office of the President invites comments on proposed revisions to the Presidential Policy on Sexual&#13;

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the daughter of immigrant parents. I&#8217;m the first in my family to go to college. I was an Educational Opportunity Program student,&#8221; Dees said. &#8220;Every aspect of my experience I owe to someone&#8217;s effort to champion equality and civil rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s humbling&#8212;such an honor to have this opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dees hopes to continue the push for educational equity and social justice by focusing on improving how the office responds to complaints, spending more time engaging with the campus community, and ultimately demonstrating that the work of the Title IX office is civil rights work.</p>
<p>Dees, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz and earned a law degree from Monterey College of Law, was selected to lead the office after a nationwide search. She previously spent two years as an investigator in the Title IX Office after working eight years as a lead service coordinator in the campus&#8217;s Disability Resource Center.</p>
<p>The Title IX Office&#8217;s work is grounded in the 1972 amendment to the education code that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity. The work of Title IX offices across the nation has received significantly more attention with people being more willing to come forward to report sexual misconduct or other instances of gender-based discrimination.</p>
<p>For the past several years, the UC Santa Cruz office has seen a sharp increase in the number of reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence, which Dees attributes to more people being willing to come forward rather than an increase in the number of incidents.</p>
<p>Dees said she believes the current generation of students rightfully expects to be in an environment free from sexual misconduct&#8212;and that the nation and academy are seeing the ripples of that through the #MeToo movement and the number of high-profile sexual misconduct cases in academia.</p>
<p>In the past year, the office focused on streamlining its work to more expediently respond to allegations. The staff found areas where the administrative process can be improved. As a result, it made significant gains in reducing the number of active cases. The office expects to have concluded all investigations launched in the last academic year by the start of classes.</p>
<p>Last fiscal year (2017&#8211;18), the office received 377 reports relating to gender discrimination or gender-based harm.</p>
<p>The office investigated 9 percent of the reports. Some of these investigations involved more than one complainant and/or report. Substantiated allegations can lead to disciplinary measures that range from a written warning up to expulsion for students or termination for employees.</p>
<p>The Title IX Office addressed 20 percent of the reports using alternative resolutions, which are actions to address and resolve a situation without a formal investigation. These actions can include educating parties to prevent future incidents, ensuring access to any university related event, program or class, providing mediation and conducting trainings.</p>
<p>The majority of the reports, 72 percent, didn&#8217;t include enough information to start an investigation or the complainants did not respond to outreach by the office. Staff provided resources to complainants, such as more information about the campus CARE Office, and the Employee Assistance Program. In 8 percent of these cases, the respondent was not affiliated with the university and thus not subject to university policy.</p>
<p>The campus has significantly invested in the office over the past several years, given the importance of the issue and increasing reports. Dees said a key priority for the office is conducting successful staff recruitments for an investigator and deputy director as adequate staffing ensures timely response and investigations.</p>
<p>The goal, Dees said, is to ensure timely investigations and afford more time for outreach, training, and innovative programing that promotes gender equity and fosters a climate of inclusion and accountability that helps prevent Title IX-related problems in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are lots of opportunities for the office to collaborate and cooperate with existing efforts to address gender equity and inclusion at UCSC, critical initiatives like Beyond Compliance. I look forward to connecting the work of the Title IX Office more closely to these efforts,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Dees will also prioritize strengthening relationships with critical campus partners like CARE, CAPS, UCPD, the residential colleges, student government, student organizations, the Academic Senate, and academic departments. Dees invites students, staff, and faculty to continue to contact or visit the office when they have a concern, but also hopes they come to see her and the Title IX Office as a resource.</p>

<p>A theoretical astrophysicist, Ramirez-Ruiz is developing the conceptual framework needed to understand the violent and capricious nature of the universe. He uses computer simulations to explore transient phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars&#8212;especially those involving compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. Both black holes and neutron stars can generate copious gravitational waves when they collide and merge, and simulations of such encounters play an essential role in the ongoing efforts to detect gravitational waves. Over the past decade, Ramirez-Ruiz has developed a cutting-edge research program in this area, pushing the frontiers of this exciting new field.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz also established the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/lamat/">Lamat program</a>, which gives undergraduate students, many of them from regional community colleges, the opportunity to work with UCSC faculty and graduate students on computational astrophysics projects. As the director of the Lamat program, Ramirez-Ruiz works vigorously to support the promotion and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).</p>
<p>The citation from APS recognizes Ramirez-Ruiz "for contributions to the understanding of transient phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars with novel computer simulations, and his work supporting promotion and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in science."</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz earned a B.S. in physics at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Cambridge (U.K.). Since joining the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2007, he has earned numerous awards and honors, including a Packard Fellowship, a Radcliffe Fellowship, a Niels Bohr Professorship from the Danish National Research Foundation, and the 2017 Edward A. Bouchet Award from the APS.</p>
<p>Election as an APS Fellow is a distinct honor signifying recognition by one's professional peers. Each year, elected fellows number no more than one-half of one percent of APS membership. APS represents over 50,000 members, including physicists in academia, national laboratories, and industry in the United States and throughout the world.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0cc1409b80727017599ca6dc3611d503"><name>kresge-town-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Update on Kresge College renewal to be given during town hall</title><start-date>1537772400000</start-date><display-name>Kresge College renewal</display-name><path>/2018/09/kresge-town-hall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/kresge-town-hall</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1537812282514</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1537812282514</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/09/images/kresge-renewal.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/09/images/kresge-renewal.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kresge-renewal.jpg</name><display-name>kresge-renewal.jpg</display-name><file-size>58756</file-size><width>500</width><height>329</height></image><image-alt>Flier on Kresge town hall</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz community is invited to hear updates and share thoughts about the Kresge College renewal project.</p>

<p>The results place new constraints on the nature of the mysterious dark energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe, said Alexie Leauthaud, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the international collaboration.</p>
<p>The HSC survey, led by the astronomical communities of Japan and Taiwan and Princeton University, is an unprecedented effort to measure gravitational lensing, in which the gravity of a galaxy in the foreground of an image bends the light from a more distant galaxy as it passes by. Gravitational lensing can reveal dark matter, which accounts for about 80 percent of the mass in the universe but cannot be observed directly.</p>
<p>Leauthaud has been involved in the survey from the beginning, joining the project when she was at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU) at the University of Tokyo, before she joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz. She helped to write the proposal that secured 300 nights for the survey on the Subaru telescope and has provided expertise with weak lensing measurements and performed critical data quality checks.</p>
<p><strong>Lumpiness</strong></p>
<p>A team of scientists led by Chiaki Hikage at the Kavli IPMU has now used the gravitational distortion of images of about 10 million galaxies to make a precise measurement of the lumpiness of matter in the universe. By combining this measurement with observations of the cosmic microwave background by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite and other cosmological experiments, the team has been able to further constrain dark energy.</p>
<p>"Taken together in the context of other weak lensing data sets, the hints of a deviation from Planck are very intriguing," Leauthaud said. "It is exciting to see what we have been able to achieve this early on in our survey. With our full data set, we will have the power to say whether or not there is a tension with Planck. That is incredibly exciting to me because we may be on the verge of learning something very interesting about the physics of dark energy."</p>
<p>Though quite weak, the gravitational lensing effect results in small but measurable distortions in the images of distant galaxies. Like a pointillist painting, the distorted images of millions of galaxies located further and further away paint a three-dimensional picture of the distribution of matter in the universe. The research team has characterized the precise amount of fluctuations in the matter distribution and their change over billions of years, from the universe's adolescence to its adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Precise measurements</strong></p>
<p>The study required precise measurements of galaxy shapes. Since the weak lensing effect is quite small, the HSC team had to control various problems affecting the measurement of shapes, such as distortions due to the atmosphere and the instrument itself. The team overcame these difficulties by using detailed painstaking image simulations of the HSC survey based on Hubble Space Telescope images.</p>
<p>When carrying out precise measurements of very small effects, it is known that people have a tendency to decide that their analysis is complete if their results confirm earlier results. The HSC team performed a so-called blind analysis of their data in order to avoid such &#8220;confirmation bias.&#8221; They carried out many tests of their catalogs for more than a year without ever seeing the actual values of cosmological parameters from their analysis or comparing with results from other experiments.</p>
<p>The HSC weak lensing measurement is used to determine the lumpiness of matter in the universe, quantified by a parameter called S8. Larger S8, for example, would mean more structure such as galaxies in the universe. With the high-precision HSC data, the team determined S8 with a precision of 3.6 percent, which is similar to the precision with which it was measured by the weak lensing analysis from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The DES surveyed&#8203; &#8203;14 times more area on the sky than HSC, but focused on the more nearby universe. With a deeper survey that images even fainter galaxies, the HSC team was able to map out a sharper dark matter distribution than was previously possible and achieved a similar precision measurement with a smaller area. This showcases the strength and complementarity of HSC among ongoing projects worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Consistent picture</strong></p>
<p>When compared to the fluctuations expected from those seen in the universe&#8217;s infancy by the Planck satellite, the HSC measurements offer a consistent picture of the cosmological model. The universe today is dominated by dark matter and dark energy, and that dark energy behaves like Einstein&#8217;s cosmological constant&#8212;the simplest model.</p>
<p>However, taken together the results from weak lensing surveys prefer a slightly smaller value of fluctuations than that predicted by the Planck satellite. This could just be a statistical fluctuation due to the limited amount of data, or it might be a signature of the breakdown of the standard model of the universe based on general relativity and the cosmological constant. The new HSC results come from a mere one tenth of the planned survey. When completed, the survey has the potential to deepen scientists' understanding of the standard cosmological model by shedding light on the behavior of dark energy.</p>
<p>The research paper has now been submitted to the journal &#8203;<em>Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan</em>&#8203; and will undergo rigorous peer review by the scientific community.</p>
<p>The HSC survey began in the spring of 2014 using the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan&#8217;s Subaru telescope located at the summit of Mt. Maunakea on the Big Island of Hawaii. The telescope features a large collecting area corresponding to a diameter of 8.2 meters, a wide angle camera that fits an area equal to about 9 moons in a single shot, and superb image quality, making it well suited to conduct a wide yet deep imaging survey of the sky. The survey has covered about 140 square degrees of sky (the area of 3,000 full moons) over 90 nights on the telescope&#8203;.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0cec528780727017599ca6dc9d67a80e"><name>principles-accountability-financial-transactions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Systemwide Review of the UC Policy on the Principles of Accountability with Respect to Financial Transactions</title><summary>The Office of the President has invited the University community to comment on the proposed Presidential Policy on the Principles of Accountability with Respect to Financial Transactions.</summary><start-date>1537858800000</start-date><display-name>Systemwide Review of the UC Policy on the Principles of Accountability with Respect to Financial Transactions</display-name><path>/2018/09/principles-accountability-financial-transactions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/principles-accountability-financial-transactions</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1537815106138</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1537815739027</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Colleagues,<br/>&#160;<br/>The Office of the President has invited the University community to comment on the proposed Presidential Policy on the Principles of Accountability with Respect to Financial Transactions.

<p>Please drive cautiously, especially along wooded roadways with little visibility. Even in open spaces, deer can be running at top speed, oblivious to oncoming vehicles. With the return of students to campus this fall, especially new students unfamiliar with the campus, the risk of hitting a deer or causing an accident by stopping suddenly or swerving is at its peak.</p>
<p>Various local organizations and campus departments assume responsibility for providing some animal services and or advice. If the animal appears to be a danger, is injured or may be injured, please call the campus police at&#160;(831) 459-2231, if there is an immediate danger, dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Another resource is Native Animal Rescue,&#160;(831) 462-0726. They will not pick up wildlife, it must be transported to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my vibe,&#8221; said Saini, a Cupertino resident and his parents&#8217; first child to head off to college. He&#8217;s looking to study computer science, after studying the subject in high school and tackling projects such as making Netflix recommendations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make stuff from my own code. I like the flexibility,&#8221; Saini said.</p>
<p>At Stevenson College, Sage Taylor placed two plants on a bench outside her residence hall. One was an African violet, and the other was one her mother recently purchased for her room. Taylor said she plans to study plant science.</p>
<p>The Davis resident spent the summer away from home, interning in Yosemite for a business that takes people on hikes, before moving in at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it made this an easier, softer transition,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Carrying a duffle bag into Stevenson College, Malik Adams said he plans to study computer science at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I&#8217;m very into tech,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Adams said he chose UC Santa Cruz because of its location and forested atmosphere&#8212;a contrast to living in Alameda.</p>
<p>This past week, UC Santa Cruz welcomed Saini, Taylor, Adams, and an additional 3,675 freshmen and 1,768 transfers, who begin instruction Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an exciting year,&#8221; said Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey. &#8220;The entire campus has collaborated to increase access to our campus through the transfer pathway, both in response to state priorities and as a result of our commitment to expanding this pathway to the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rapid rise in transfer students would not have been possible without this work and strong collaborations with our community college partners and the UC Office of the President.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students are joining UC Santa Cruz at a remarkable time, with the campus finishing its new <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/">Strategic Academic Plan</a>, offering a redesigned core course in the residential colleges, providing more training to foster an inclusive environment, and advancing in college rankings that underscore the university&#8217;s role in helping students and alumni improve their social standing.</p>
<p>The Strategic Academic Plan identifies three academic priority areas&#8212; <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/#earthfutures">Earth Futures</a>, <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/#justice">Justice in a Changing World</a>, and <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/#digitalinterventions">Digital Interventions</a>&#8212;that will help give the campus a greater role on the international stage. The plan also provides new design principles for the campus and focuses on removing institutional barriers to research, teaching, and learning.</p>
<p>The campus recruited 35 new faculty members this academic year, bringing the total number of Academic Senate faculty to 603. Their expertise both builds on existing strengths and will help push campus scholarship in new directions.</p>
<h3>New offerings</h3>
<p>Students this year will experience a redesigned approach to the core course offered at each of the 10 residential colleges, the campus&#8217;s renown communities of learning. UC Santa Cruz redesigned the class to focus on university discourse and shifted the writing requirements previously included in core to different courses. The core course is designed to prepare students for the UC Santa Cruz experience that&#8217;s grounded in critical reading, thinking and engagement.</p>
<p>Each college will continue to offer a distinct course that aligns with its theme. For example, students in College Nine will look at international and global issues, while students in Cowell will center their course on imagining justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core course has long been a defining element of a UC Santa Cruz education,&#8221; Hughey said. &#8220;We think the changes will make the course better than ever by providing students with an opportunity to grapple with big ideas.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Diversity, inclusion, and excellence</h3>
<p>All incoming students will take a new diversity, equity, and inclusion online program. The program teaches students about concepts related to identity, bias, power, privilege, and oppression, and discusses the benefits of being part of diverse community. The program was developed in close collaboration with student leaders.</p>
<p>"This program is a positive outcome of students&#8217; requests to best prepare incoming frosh and transfer students for our unique social-justice oriented campus culture," said Teresa Maria Linda Scholz, diversity officer for staff and students. "This educational program is also a result of the collaborative efforts of students, staff and administrators who have been committed to inclusive excellence."</p>
<p>Incoming undergraduates show more ethnic diversity from fall 2017. African American/Black students increased by 12 percent (29 more students), American Indian/Alaskan Native increased by 10 percent (10 more students), and Hispanic students increased by 3 percent (42 more students).</p>
<p>The academic profile of the incoming frosh remains very strong with an average GPA of 3.79 and test scores showing increases. Approximately a third of the incoming students will be the first in their family to earn a four-year degree.</p>
<p>More than 3,100 of the entering freshmen hail from California with about 600 coming from other states or countries.</p>
<p>The focus on opportunity and excellence helped to push the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/usnwr-rankings.html">campus ranking higher</a> in the annual U.S. News and World Report list. UC Santa Cruz is among the top 30 public universities in the nation.</p>
<p>In addition to promoting social mobility, UC Santa Cruz is also dedicated to helping students pay for college. In 2016&#8211;17, 77 percent of undergraduate students received $278 million in financial aid. Additionally, 69 percent of UC Santa Cruz graduate students received $20 million in aid.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is providing campus housing to more than 9,300 students, about half of its student body. Through the proposed Student Housing West project, UC Santa Cruz plans to build more than 3,000 new beds on campus to increase housing options for graduate students and upper division undergraduates.</p>
<p>Students moved in last week and have been busy learning about the campus through a series of <a href="https://orientation.ucsc.edu/fall/schedule/index.html">welcome week</a> events that continue into October.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1230c15480727017599ca6dc0af47f05"><name>new-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New faculty to advance campus teaching, research</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is welcoming more than 35 new faculty members this year, bringing the campus total to 603.&#13;

<p>The new professors and lecturers with security of employment, spread across all five divisions, further build on campus strengths in many key areas&#8212;from artificial intelligence to the environment.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the senate faculty members who were hired for this academic year, as well as research summaries they provided.</p>
<p><strong>Wolfgang Altmannshofer, assistant professor</strong><br/> Physics<br/> I am performing research in the field of theoretical particle physics. My research addresses fundamental questions about the basic constituents of nature. What is the origin of mass of the elementary particles? What distinguishes the different types (&#8220;flavors&#8221;) of matter particles?</p>
<p><strong>Lily Balloffet, assistant professor</strong><br/> Latin American and Latino Studies<br/> I study histories and cultures of migration in the Global South. In particular, I look at the ways in which migration between Latin America and the Middle East has connected these two regions since the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Batalha, professor</strong><br/> Astronomy and astrophysics<br/> Batalha is an astrophysicist working on the detection and characterization of planets orbiting other stars in the galaxy with the objective of finding evidence of life beyond the solar system.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Beamer, assistant professor</strong><br/> Computer science and engineering<br/> Beamer&#8217;s research develops techniques to more efficiently move data within computing systems, which in turn enables new applications by making larger datasets and richer algorithms more tractable. His communication-centric approach improves data movement efficiency by considering both hardware and software perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Courtney Bonam, assistant professor</strong><br/> Psychology<br/> Broadly, Bonam studies racial stereotyping and discrimination processes as they impact social perception, interpersonal interaction, and person-environment interaction.

<p>Given the publicity, I can confirm that our Title IX investigation concluded that this professor engaged in conduct that violated the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment, which was the applicable policy that was in place until 2015. Now that the investigation has concluded, we are moving to the next step in the procedures for the disciplinary process pursuant to the required <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/images/title-ix-workflow-18091.pdf">personnel procedures</a>. The professor remains on leave. I want to thank the brave people who came forward to our Title IX Office to report their experiences.</p>
<p>We expect everyone in our campus community to know that sexual harassment and sexual misconduct are at odds with the values of our campus. Like all of you, I want UC Santa Cruz to be free from sexual misconduct of any kind. I am deeply troubled when I hear allegations about anyone being abused, harassed, or marginalized. Our campus is one that strives to welcome everyone and treat them equitably. This case&#8212;and the many others inside and outside academia&#8212;serves as a reminder of how much further we have to go as a campus and as a culture.</p>
<p>I believe our Beyond Compliance initiative is an important step in helping to reshape our campus culture and make clear to everyone that sexual violence and sexual harassment have no place here. This initiative already has led to near-term improvements in how we respond to allegations of sexual misconduct, yet it is the long-term change that will serve our community for decades to come.</p>
<p>I recognize that we can&#8212;and should&#8212;be more open about the work of our Title IX Office, while still ensuring the confidentiality and protecting the due-process rights of all parties involved. This fall, the Title IX Office will publish a report that provides more insight into the number of reports at UC Santa Cruz and how they are handled. I&#8217;ve asked that this be an annual report so that we can keep our community better informed in this area.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have more <a href="images/title-ix-workflow-18091.pdf">information online</a> about the Title IX process as well as an <a href="title-ix-faq.xml">FAQ section</a>.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the campus will hold a town hall meeting next month to provide updates on our Title IX Office, our CARE office, our Beyond Compliance initiative, and more. We will soon share details about the day, time, and location. In light of this news and with the start of a new academic year, it&#8217;s important for all of us to join together to ensure we&#8217;re doing all we can to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>Finally, I encourage anyone in our community who has been the victim of sexual violence or sexual harassment to reach out to our <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu">Title IX Office</a>.

Now, the USDA is funding an effort to help those programs evaluate their success.</p>
<p>Led by UC Santa Cruz, the new program is designed to take the dread out of evaluation and help administrators build feedback and reflection into their day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>"We want to make evaluation painless to administer," said project leader Jan Perez, a research specialist with the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). "Good information can help administrators improve their programs, get better at what they're doing, and get more funding."</p>
<p>The needs of farmers during their first 10 years in agriculture vary regionally, as do support programs across the country, said Perez. "It's hard to get into farming in much of California because land costs are so high," said Perez. "In some areas in the Midwest, it's not as hard to get started, but it's hard to stay in farming."</p>
<p>Support and training programs focus on everything from land acquisition and agricultural skills to marketing strategies and business competencies. Some programs are tailored to the unique needs of certain groups, including female farmers and immigrants who are new to the country.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>With all the resources, time, and effort going into beginning-farmer support, Perez says it only makes sense to help all these programs assess their effectiveness. "This grant is about helping them improve what they do and giving them a place to discuss what's working&#8212;and what isn't," she said.</p>
<p>Perez, who won the competitive three-year, $600,000 grant, is in a good position to know. UC Santa Cruz is home to the <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship/">Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture</a>, one of the longest-running, university-based organic beginning-farmer training programs in the country. In 2009, Perez led a <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu/documents/research-briefs/RB_14.apprentice_survey.pdf">follow-up survey of apprenticeship graduates</a>&#8212;the first of several evaluations of beginning farmer programs she would conduct. In 2012, with support from UCSC's first USDA grant for beginning farmers, Perez led a more comprehensive evaluation of the apprenticeship. She designed workshop evaluations and an annual assessment tool that apprentices use to reflect on what they've learned, and she developed systems that make it easy for staff to enter and analyze data.</p>
<p>"At first, staff did it because it was required, but it's really gratifying for me because they found value in it and have kept doing it," said Perez. Instructors get feedback on their teaching and the content of their lessons, apprentices get a chance to reflect on how much they have learned, and program managers put the input to use by tweaking the curriculum, filling gaps, and improving the learning experience for everyone.</p>
<p>"Evaluation is a powerful tool for continual program improvement," said Perez.</p>
<p>But administrators are often initially skeptical, viewing evaluation as a burdensome chore. "Universities often have more experience and resources for doing it, but a lot of nonprofits feel pretty overwhelmed by the task. It's more work," said Perez, whose goal is to make evaluation easier and more attractive.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting a new generation of farmers</strong></p>
<p>The USDA is eager to grow a new crop of successful owner-operator farmers, and Perez's goal is to create an "evaluation learning community" of people running programs that support beginning farmers. Supported by this new grant, she will use webinars, teleconferencing, and digital tools to build the community. She hopes to showcase "evaluation advocates"&#8212;members of training organizations who will share their experiences, including their initial reluctance to "add one more thing," and speak to the benefits of evaluation.</p>
<p>"I want to make it relevant and useful to organizations, so they can see how evaluation can help them build their reputation, attract more participants&#8212;and be accountable to them," said Perez.</p>
<p>The USDA's Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program (BFRDP) was written into the federal Farm Bill in 2008 with support from then-Congressman Sam Farr (D-Carmel). In 2012, CASFS, which runs the apprenticeship, received a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/08/casfs-usda-grant.html">$665,000 BFRDP grant</a> to train novice farmers. Collaborators on that grant included three local sustainable agriculture organizations: the Ecological Farming Association (EFA), the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF), and California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF); one of the outcomes of that grant was the establishment of the Central Coast Farmer Education Network.</p>
<p>Perez notes that support for beginning farmers takes many shapes and forms. It is offered by university-based programs, extension programs, nonprofits like EFA, CAFF, and CCOF, and farms like Pie Ranch in Pescadero, which is operated by apprenticeship graduates Nancy Vail and Jered Lawson. Support ranges from individual classes to full-time programs like UCSC's six-month residential apprenticeship.</p>
<p>"There are hundreds of people all across the country doing this work," she said, noting that more than 700 organizations have applied to the BFRDP for funding since its inception in 2009.</p>
<p>Perez will partner with Jennifer Hashley, a CASFS apprenticeship graduate who is the director of the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project at Tufts University, and Kim Niewolny, an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural, Leadership, and Community Education at Virginia Tech, to implement the new grant. Daniel Press, executive director of CASFS and a professor of environmental studies, will provide project oversight as the principal investigator.</p>

He literally thought it was a joke when he heard that someone had put his name forward to run the nation's largest and oldest public defender's office.</p>
<p>Then he started thinking about what he might have to offer, beginning with his deep desire to bring greater dignity and respect to a profession he loves. Lucky for Los Angeles he did, because this fall Garcia will take the helm of the LA County Public Defender's Office, leading a team of 1,200 that includes 750 attorneys.</p>
<p>Garcia (Cowell '91, politics and Latin American studies) is taking on this monumental job with his eyes wide open. He is intimately familiar with the paradox of the public defender's role: The mission is honorable&#8212;they give meaning to the Constitutional guarantee of legal representation regardless of ability to pay&#8212;yet as a profession, public defenders are ridiculed and sometimes scorned for doing their job, particularly when it means representing the indigent accused in high-profile, violent crimes.</p>
<p>"We're the joke of every crime show: 'You got a <em>public defender</em>? Now you'd better hire a <em>real </em>attorney!'" lamented Garcia, who spent more than two decades as a public defender in San Diego County, most recently&#160;representing members of gangs, Mexican drug cartels, and other clients accused of crimes that could bring the death penalty. "A prosecutor asked me once, 'How do you defend people you know are guilty?' "</p>
<p>As insulting as his question was, that prosecutor was simply repeating what Garcia and every public defender has heard&#8212;and what many people wonder about. Garcia's response speaks to the humanity he brings to his work.</p>
<p>"A human being is not their worst moments in their life," he said. "They are so much more than that. My clients are multidimensional individuals. The criminal justice system reduces them to their worst moments, but I get to know my clients as human beings, and it's easier to see their humanity."</p>
<p>Garcia hastens to add that he believes in accountability, but the presumption of innocence comes first. That pillar of democracy is being eroded today, with help from media coverage that tends to present the accused in the worst possible light, he said.</p>
<p>"As a society, we have to live and breathe the presumption of innocence, and I don't think that's what we do," he said.</p>
<p>Recounting the insulting question posed by that prosecutor, Garcia recalls turning the question around and asking him, "How do you prosecute people you know are innocent?"</p>
<p>Pausing, he explains: "I don't want to believe anyone would knowingly do that, but we all know that innocent people have been convicted, and some have been executed."</p>
<p>That desire to set the record straight is part of what fuels Garcia as he anticipates his new job. He is eager to cultivate professional pride among his colleagues and to build public appreciation for the vital role played by public defenders. "I realized I have contributions I want to make as a lawyer and as a leader," he said of the new job. "I knew I wanted to give back."</p>
<p><strong>Undercurrents of racism</strong></p>
<p>The path to the courtroom wasn't straightforward for Garcia. In the only glimpse of his future that was evident during college, Garcia interned in the Santa Cruz County district attorney's office. In fact, he was inside Gottschalk's department store on Pacific Avenue, shopping for khaki pants and dress shirts for his internship, when the Loma Prieta earthquake struck on Oct. 17, 1989. "I had some wonderful&#8212;in the sense of maturing&#8212;and terrifying experiences that day," he said.</p>
<p>But Garcia almost didn't make it to college. During high school, he planned to join the Marine Corps after graduation. Looking back now, Garcia detects what he calls "undercurrents of racism" in some of his classmates&#8217; advice.</p>
<p>"They said I couldn't go to college and made references to affirmative action, and I bought into that," he said. "It was a guidance counselor at Santa Monica High School who said, 'You have some skills. You might consider university as another option.'"</p>
<p>When Garcia enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, he became the first in his family to go to college. He embraced everything about the experience. "I fell in love with the school," he said. "It changed me as a person. I fell in love with academics and learning."</p>
<p>He also bought his first pair of Birkenstocks&#8212;and has owned a pair ever since.</p>
<p>"I was a Latino city boy who'd grown up in the LA area and Mexico City, but I got into tie dye. I let my hair grow," said Garcia. "Santa Cruz was so important to me as a young man. It was the perfect place at the perfect moment in time for my development."</p>
<p>He was inspired by Literature Professor Roberto Crespi ("He helped me learn to blow up my writing and challenge conventional norms"), as well as two professors of politics: Dan Wirls ("He was so young and so accomplished!") and Sonia Alvarez ("She was so tough on me. She taught me reading skills that transformed my ability to take on material"). Garcia was later diagnosed with dyslexia but credits Alvarez and a close friend with providing timely support.</p>
<p>Garcia excelled academically, and he became more socially conscious, learning about the politics and historical roots of racism. But what he most values is the ability he acquired to think freely. On a campus known for progressive attitudes, Garcia challenged everything, including the conventional norm of radical politics.</p>
<p>"I learned to think critically about all ideas&#8212;progressive, conservative," he said. "I learned not to judge ideas, or people or their thinking, but to analyze them objectively. My experience at UCSC was the starting point academically that allowed me to be strong enough, brave enough&#8212;and maybe foolhardy enough&#8212;to do this job I'm about to start."</p>
<p><strong>"I really didn't like law school"</strong></p>
<p>After graduating in 1991, Garcia contemplated graduate school, but his grandmother wanted him to go to law school. Torn, he opted to please his grandmother, figuring he could always go back to academia.</p>
<p>Garcia took a year off, studying for the LSAT and working as a short-order chef and health-club trainer to earn enough money to do a little traveling. He applied only to the best schools and chose Boalt Hall, now Berkeley Law.</p>
<p>"I really didn't like law school," he said. "I thought it would be like graduate school--the intellectual study of the law, studying and writing about legal thought and cultural norms. I almost left after the first year."</p>
<p>Contemplating life after graduation, Garcia revisited the idea of graduate school, but an interview with the San Diego Public Defender's office proved pivotal: He got the job and discovered his calling.</p>
<p>"I enjoy my clients and their stories, and I feel a kinship to many of them," he said. "I feel like I am fighting the good fight, standing up for justice."</p>
<p><strong>The longest trial in state history</strong></p>
<p>The toughest case Ricardo Garcia handled was career-defining&#8212;and ultimately life-changing, as well.</p>
<p>Garcia spent 15 months defending Jorge Rojas, who was already serving a life sentence when he was brought to trial as the ringleader of a series of kidnappings and murders that terrorized San Diego between 2004 and 2007. If convicted of masterminding the slayings, Rojas could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>"Everybody said it was unwinnable," said Garcia. "It seemed an impossible task."</p>
<p>Garcia refused to accept that. He immersed himself in the details of nine separate homicide investigations and waded through hundreds of thousands of pages of material. Ultimately, Garcia and his team prevailed. The longest trial in state history ended with a victory: They saved Rojas&#8217; life.</p>
<p>But mid-way through the trial, Garcia saw the toll it was taking on his own life.</p>
<p>"I was in court every day, having dinner with colleagues and working every night, working eight hours on Saturday and Sunday," he recalled. One day he saw his son "act out" at a party and didn't recognize his own child's behavior. "I'd been too exhausted to interact, and I'd become detached. I decided I couldn't let the job kill me or destroy my life."</p>
<p>Garcia made some changes: He made it a point to get home in time to put his two young boys to bed. He set aside one weekend day for family time, and had a "date night" every Tuesday with his wife&#8212;even if it meant just spending time together at home without the distractions of phones and screens.</p>
<p>"That trial changed my view of what it means to be a public defender," he said. "In public defense, you're not always encouraged to live a balanced life. It's like, whoever works the longest wins&#8212;but really, they lose."</p>
<p>Maintaining balance in his life during that marathon of a trial also taught Garcia that he has the grit to accomplish anything he sets out to do&#8212;including taking on this new job.</p>
<p><strong>A passion for education and justice</strong></p>
<p>Garcia's own love of learning has spilled over into a love of teaching. In addition to his work in the courtroom, Garcia is an adjunct professor at California Western School of Law, where he teaches criminal procedure and motions to Latin American lawyers. He is also a guest lecturer for the school's <a href="https://www.cwsl.edu/clinics-and-programs/proyecto-acceso"><em> Proyecto Acceso</em></a>, a program that trains lawyers, judges, and prosecutors in Mexico and South America, as they transform their criminal justice systems. Garcia is a regular contributor to the California Public Defenders Association. He is also a faculty member at the Schechmeister Death Penalty College at Santa Clara University.</p>
<p>As a student, an educator, and a public defender, Garcia is drawn to ideals. With more than two decades of experience in the criminal justice system, he is keenly frustrated by the racial injustice that permeates it and the impact racial disparity has, particularly on men of color.</p>
<p>"It's pervasive, institutionalized, and self-perpetuating to a degree," he said. "It's such a part of our criminal justice system's DNA, even among the people who see it and want to foster change, which is most of us. It's in the courtrooms, in the way police police&#8212;I'm not saying it's always intentional, I don't believe that&#8212;it's in the way we prosecute, and the way judges judge cases. It doesn't matter if a judge is Latino, black, or a woman. At times, even defense lawyers take it into their DNA, because the majority of their clients are people of color, and that has an unconscious effect. I don't know what the solution is. You fight it, yelling until your throat is dry."</p>
<p>If he could, Garcia would abolish capital punishment: "I don't see it as a deterrent, and it speaks poorly of us as a society."</p>
<p>Finally, Garcia embraces what he calls a "holistic approach to client representation" that looks at the whole person.</p>
<p>"My clients are human beings who fundamentally need resources and access to resources," he said. "They need education, job training, housing, food, drug treatment programs, parenting classes. It's giving people dignity in their day to day lives, so they're no longer just looked at as a number going through the criminal justice system."</p>
<p>"Human beings are so complex and layered. We're beautiful in that complexity," he said. "When people are broken, we need to help them get fixed. That's true in the criminal justice system, too."</p>
<p>As he anticipates his new job, Garcia looks forward to strengthening a culture that puts the client's needs first, followed by all those who have direct contact with clients: attorneys, investigators, social workers, mental health clinicians, and drug counselors.</p>
<p>"They are trying to give the best services, and they see it. They feel it. They suffer the trauma," he said. "I respect the people who do this work with energy and love, and they deserve a boss who understands and rewards that."</p>
<p>Garcia will step into his new leadership role in mid-October.</p>

We are thrilled to have you. You&#8217;ll soon discover that UC Santa Cruz is an extraordinary place, offering you the opportunity to pursue your interests &#8212; academic, professional, and personal &#8212; and to discover new ones.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To those who are returning, welcome back! No matter where you are in your UC Santa Cruz journey, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/back-to-school.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">start the academic year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off right: Get involved, introduce yourself to someone new, or just do what Slugs do &#8212; blaze a new trail in whatever area you choose!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018-19 academic year promises to be an exciting one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are part-way through what we have dubbed our </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Year of Alumni</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a celebration of some of our most notable graduates &#8212; Slugs out in the world making a difference. They are testimony to the culture of innovation, exploration, and creative expression that thrives on our campus. Our </span><a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Celebration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October will feature three prominent alumni journalists in conversation about the media and what it&#8217;s like working in today&#8217;s charged political climate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are nearing implementation of our new </span><a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategic Academic Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one we believe will give us a higher profile on the international stage, highlighting our cutting-edge scholarship and interdisciplinary collaborations, and providing a visionary model for public higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our still-in-the-works </span><a href="https://lrdp.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long Range Development Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meanwhile, will help define our university&#8217;s physical future. A campus committee made up of planners, faculty, staff, and students, with input from a panel of community members, will continue their work throughout the year. The end result will be a blueprint, valid until the year 2040, for how the campus might grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re preparing to broadly share our plans for a renewal of Kresge, one of our 10 residential colleges. It&#8217;s exciting to plan the physical revitalization of one of campus&#8217;s most dynamic, iconic institutions. Its reinvigoration sets it up to prosper for its next 50 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also continue to pursue </span><a href="http://ucsc.edu/shw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a project I believe is crucial to supporting student success. It will give us more than 3,000 new on-campus beds, which will pull upper-division students who struggle to find safe and affordable housing in the community back to campus, helping them while also easing pressure on the greater housing market. The project will also allow us to ease overcrowding in existing dorms and to expand our child-care options for students, staff, and faculty with young children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This academic year also sees the arrival of more than 35 </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/new-faculty.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new faculty members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across all five academic divisions. This tremendous infusion of new energy, ideas, and expertise helps keep our campus vibrant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important to acknowledge that this year begins, like last, in uncertain political times, and freedom of speech continues to be a hot topic on campuses nationwide. When does speech cross over to something more hateful? Should we intervene? I believe freedom of speech is a fundamental right in America. It allows us to express opinions, no matter how unpopular, and to criticize other views. This free exchange of ideas is integral to a university. I urge all to help make UC Santa Cruz an inclusive and welcoming marketplace of ideas, where all are treated respectfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexual violence and other forms of sexual harassment on college campuses also, unfortunately, remain in the headlines. I would like to reiterate UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s strong commitment to eliminating sexual violence and harassment here. I am hopeful that our efforts are succeeding, but recognize there is much left to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we are lucky to live, work, and play in such a beautiful setting. Forty-six years after I began here, I remain in awe of the sweeping vistas that suddenly open to view as I move around campus. But I also understand that college is a big change for many people. It can be stressful. So, if you need assistance or support in any way, reach out and ask for it. Our </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program is top-notch, as is our </span><a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Division of Student Success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the staff at each of our residential colleges are incredible resources. Know that campus is filled with people eager to help you succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best of luck to all during this 2018-19 academic year. Fiat Slug!</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="7051ddd180727017273daba439a2ad08"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1535788800000</start-date><path>/2018/09/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/09/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1513712901567</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1513887857828</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
