<p>The study, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6375/568">published February 2 in <em>Science</em></a>, reveals the physiological mechanisms behind observed declines in polar bear populations, said first author Anthony Pagano, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"We've been documenting declines in polar bear survival rates, body condition, and population numbers over the past decade," he said. "This study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those declines by looking at the actual energy needs of polar bears and how often they're able to catch seals."</p>
<p>Pagano, who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), conducted the study as part of his Ph.D. thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where he has been working with coauthors Terrie Williams and Daniel Costa, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>The researchers monitored the behavior, hunting success, and metabolic rates of adult female polar bears without cubs as they hunted for prey on the sea ice of the Beaufort Sea in the spring. High-tech collars on the bears recorded video, locations, and activity levels over a period of eight to 11 days, while metabolic tracers enabled the team to determine how much energy the bears expended.</p>
<p>The field metabolic rates they measured averaged more than 50 percent higher than previous studies had predicted. Five of the nine bears in the study lost body mass, meaning they weren't catching enough fat-rich marine mammal prey to meet their energy demands.</p>
<p>"This was at the start of the period from April through July when polar bears catch most of their prey and put on most of the body fat they need to sustain them throughout the year," Pagano said.</p>
<p><strong>Climate change</strong></p>
<p>Climate change is having dramatic effects on the Arctic sea ice, forcing polar bears to move greater distances and making it harder for them to catch prey. In the Beaufort Sea, sea ice starts to retreat away from the continental shelf in July, and most of the bears move north on the ice as it retreats. As the Arctic warms and more sea ice melts, the bears are having to move much greater distances than previously. This causes them to expend more energy during the summer, when they are fasting until the ice returns to the continental shelf in the fall.</p>
<p>In other areas, such as Hudson Bay, most bears move onto land when the sea ice retreats. There, Arctic warming means the sea ice is breaking up earlier in the summer and returning later in the fall, forcing bears to spend more time on land.</p>
<p>"Either way, it's an issue of how much fat they can put on before the ice starts to break up, and then how much energy are they having to expend," Pagano said.</p>
<p>Previous studies had tried to estimate polar bear metabolic rates and energy expenditures based on some assumptions about their behavior and physiology. For example, since polar bears are primarily "sit and wait" hunters, it was thought this would minimize their energy expenditure during hunting. Researchers also speculated that polar bears could lower their metabolic rate to save energy if they were not successful catching seals, Pagano said.</p>
<p>"We found that polar bears actually have much higher energy demands than predicted. They need to be catching a lot of seals," he said.</p>
<p>In the spring, polar bears are mostly preying on recently weaned ringed seals, which are more susceptible to being caught than adult seals. By the fall, the young seals are older and wiser, and polar bears are not able to catch as many. "It's thought that bears might catch a couple per month in the fall, compared to five to 10 per month in the spring and early summer," Pagano said.</p>
<p><strong>Population decline</strong></p>
<p>USGS researchers have been studying polar bears in the Beaufort Sea area since the 1980s. Their most recent population estimate indicates the polar bear population has declined by about 40 percent over the past decade. It has been difficult, however, for researchers to study the fundamental biology and behavior of polar bears in this very remote and harsh environment, Pagano said.</p>
<p>"We now have the technology to learn how they are moving on the ice, their activity patterns, and their energy needs, so we can better understand the implications of these changes we are seeing in the sea ice," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Pagano, Williams, and Costa, the coauthors of the paper include USGS researchers George Durner, Karyn Rode, Todd Atwood, and Elizabeth Peacock; Stephen Atkinson of Dugald, Manitoba; and Megan Owen at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research.

One reason for this is the technical difficulty of manufacturing vaccines based on the envelope proteins of the virus, according to Phil Berman, who led development of a major component of the only vaccine to have shown any efficacy against HIV in a clinical trial.</p>
<p>Berman, the Baskin Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has now developed new methods for the production of HIV vaccines. His approach solves major technical problems which have bedeviled the field. Berman described the new methods, and the candidate vaccines his lab has produced, in a talk at a conference on HIV vaccines held last week in Canada ("<a href="http://www.keystonesymposia.org/18J5">Emerging Technologies in Vaccine Discovery and Development</a>," a joint meeting with "<a href="http://www.keystonesymposia.org/18J6">Progress and Pathways Toward an Effective HIV Vaccine</a>," January 28 to February 1 in Banff, Alberta, part of the <a href="https://www.keystonesymposia.org/">Keystone Symposia Global Health Series</a>).</p>
<p>"Dozens of interesting vaccine candidates have been described, but most have not been tested in humans because it has not previously been possible to manufacture them affordably and in a timely fashion," Berman said. "The technology we developed should break the logjam in HIV vaccine development, because it tremendously shortens the time, improves the yield, and lowers the cost."</p>
<p><strong>Stable cell lines</strong></p>
<p>Berman's lab was able to use robotics to shorten the time required to produce stable cell lines, needed to make the proteins for a vaccine, while at the same time greatly increasing how much of the protein the cell lines can produce. The improved yield makes it possible to reduce the size of the bioreactor needed to make vaccine for large clinical trials--from 2,000- to 10,000-liter vessels to 50- or 100-liter vessels--resulting in tremendous savings in the equipment required and cost of materials. In addition, Berman's lab was able to create cell lines that make HIV envelope proteins with the right kind of carbohydrate components (called glycans) needed for an effective immune response.</p>
<p>"The carbohydrates attached to the protein are really important, something no one realized until recently," Berman said. "The conventional way of making these envelope protein vaccines incorporated the wrong kind of carbohydrates. We now know that destroyed many of the important antigenic sites recognized by protective antibodies."</p>
<p>Cell lines derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the industry standard used to produce complex recombinant proteins for therapeutic use. These cells are also useful for the production of HIV vaccines. The gene for the desired protein is transferred into CHO cells in a process called transfection, and tens of thousands of transfected cells are screened to find the few rare cells that produce large amounts of the protein. The best cell lines are grown in large batches, in a process similar to yeast fermentation for making beer, and the proteins are then isolated and purified.</p>
<p><strong>Robotic method</strong></p>
<p>Berman's lab developed a new robotic method to isolate high-producing cell lines making HIV envelope proteins. This shortened the time required to produce stable cell lines from 18 to 24 months to just 2 or 3 months, while increasing yields by a factor of 100 to 200. Those improvements are in comparison with Berman's previous experience creating the AIDSVAX vaccine, first at Genentech and then at VaxGen.</p>
<p>AIDSVAX was one component of an experimental vaccine regimen used in a large-scale clinical trial known as RV144, which showed 31 percent efficacy in preventing new HIV infections. The RV144 results showed that protection was correlated with antibodies to a certain segment of an HIV envelope protein called gp120. Other research, however, revealed that many of the most potent antibodies (broadly neutralizing antibodies capable of neutralizing many different strains of HIV) actually recognize the carbohydrate components (glycans) attached to gp120.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that the original AIDSVAX vaccine had the completely wrong type of carbohydrate, and that we might improve the level of protection if we could find a way to make it with the proper type of carbohydrate,&#8221; Berman said.</p>
<p>So he and graduate student Gabriel Byrne set out to create a cell line that can produce the unusual glycans found on HIV envelope proteins rather than the complex glycans CHO cells normally produce. This was made possible by the powerful new gene editing technology known as CRISPR/Cas9. Berman's lab used CRISPR to create a new cell line they called MGAT CHO, which produces proteins lacking complex glycans containing sialic acid and enriched for the simple "high mannose" type found on HIV envelope proteins. An unexpected benefit of this new cell line was that it enabled a simpler, less expensive process for recovering and purifying the proteins.</p>
<p>"People used to think carbohydrates are not immunogenic, but HIV turns everything on its head, and it turns out that the most important antibodies are directed to this unusual carbohydrate," Berman said. "We can now make vaccines with it for the first time, and we've created an improved version of the vaccine used in the RV144 trial. Our hope is that it will bring the efficacy up from 31 percent to greater than 50 percent, the level likely required for product registration."</p>
<p><strong>Clinical trials</strong></p>
<p>Berman's lab currently has two cell lines he said are ready to start producing vaccines on a large scale. He is now looking for partners and funding to bring them into clinical trials. One vaccine is an improved version of AIDSVAX that incorporates the right kind of glycans. The other is made from a strain of the virus called Clade C that is widespread in Southern Africa and India and accounts for the majority of new HIV infections worldwide.</p>
<p>Researchers have continued to use the AIDSVAX vaccine in clinical studies because it has been so hard to make new HIV vaccines, Berman said, noting that there have been 14 such studies since the RV144 results were released in 2009. "They're still using that same old vaccine we made in the early 1990s. Although the stability and safety of the product is testament to the quality of the vaccine we made, new vaccines are required that take advantage of all that we have learned since that time," he said. "It just emphasizes the need to find a more efficient way to make an HIV vaccine."</p>
<p>In addition to Berman's talk, several other members of his lab presented details of their methods and findings at the conference. Berman said they expect to publish their findings in several papers later this year. This research was funded by major grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="59a65039807270176c500acf5f16602f"><name>sesnon-resistance-exhibition</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Spoken/Unspoken: Forms of Resistance' to open Feb. 8 at Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery</title><summary>The Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery will present Spoken/Unspoken: Forms of Resistance, a new public exhibition running February 8 through March 17 at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news</keywords><start-date>1517543100000</start-date><display-name>'Spoken/Unspoken: Forms of Resistance' to open Feb. 8 at Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery</display-name><path>/2018/02/sesnon-resistance-exhibition</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/sesnon-resistance-exhibition</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1517627526151</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1517958639361</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>History of Art and Visual Culture</value><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/molina-jaguar-305.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/molina-jaguar-305.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>molina-jaguar-305.jpg</name><display-name>molina-jaguar-305.jpg</display-name><file-size>204237</file-size><width>305</width><height>433</height></image><image-alt>art by Self Help Graphics artist Laura Molina </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/molina-jaguar-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/molina-jaguar-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>molina-jaguar-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>molina-jaguar-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28809</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>art by Self Help Graphics artist Laura Molina </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>(Courtesy of Self Help Graphics artist Laura Molina)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/WomensWorkYolandaLopez-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/WomensWorkYolandaLopez-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>WomensWorkYolandaLopez-350.jpg</name><display-name>WomensWorkYolandaLopez-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>190098</file-size><width>350</width><height>365</height></image><image-alt>Womens Work © Yolanda Lopez</image-alt><image-caption>Womens Work &#169; Yolanda Lopez</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery will present <em><strong>Spoken/Unspoken: Forms of Resistance</strong>,</em> a new public exhibition running February 8 through March 17 at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Highlighting a collection of artists and activists engaged with different forms of resistance, the Sesnon show is part of a Santa Cruz countywide &#8220;Spoken/Unspoken&#8221; collaborative exhibition series that brings together 11 art venues, each presenting its own interpretation of the theme.</p>
<p>&#8220;The term &#8216;resistance&#8217; can represent various profiles from opposition to struggle, and it can also portray resilience, strength, courage, and standing up for basic rights,&#8221; noted Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham. &#8220;Many artists examine the strength behind resistance and challenge the status quo from politics to art making.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The show will offer a diversity of topics and artistic approaches focused on particular moments and themes that remain relevant today&#8212;from questions of immigration and representation to the fight for equality,&#8221; Graham added.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the core of the exhibition is the belief that artists play a critical role in transforming our time by speaking out and shaping the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Featured artists in the exhibition will include Ruth-Marion Baruch, Irene Carvajal, Jo Hanson, Laura Kina, Hung Liu, Yolanda Lopez, UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor Irene Lusztig, and Yoko Ono, along with posters from the Guerrilla Girls.</p>
<p>A number of the works in the exhibition are from Self Help Graphics, a print studio and gallery founded in 1970 in East Los Angeles, dedicated to the production and distribution of prints and other art media by Chicano and Latino artists.</p>
<p>An opening reception will take place at the gallery on Thursday, February 8, beginning at 4:30 p.m., with remarks by guest speakers Betty Avila and Alexa Kim from Self Help Graphics at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Avila and Kim will also present a public lecture titled &#8220;Art Transforms Communities&#8221; at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History, in conjunction with the Sesnon exhibition, on Friday, Feb. 9, beginning at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p><em>Spoken/Unspoken: Forms of Resistance</em> is sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division, History of Art and Visual Culture department, Chicano Latino Research Center, the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, and ARRT, a local Santa Cruz Art Collective.</p>

<p>Deep thanks for your continued engagement with our strategic academic planning (SAP) process. Broad participation is vital as we chart our academic course forward. Today&#8217;s email is a regular update on our progress. The first few months of the process are foundational, as we work to understand our shared values and academic strengths, and begin to explore the major academic themes that have the greatest potential return&#8212;in terms of research and teaching&#8212;for additional investment. This can&#8217;t be repeated enough: There is no preconceived direction. Those who participate in our planning process will shape the plan. Our outreach is ongoing.</p>
<h4>EMERGING</h4>
<p>While we are still early in the process, surveys and interviews with hundreds of campus leaders, faculty, staff and students have begun to reveal some of our campus&#8217;s most promising academic themes. Beginning this week, we are kicking off our Themed Academic Working Groups. The groups will give faculty the chance to unite across department and divisional lines to collaboratively reimagine how their research and teaching could be enhanced. That could be through the infusion of new resources, the elimination of internal campus barriers, or the generation of new resource streams. The groups also will have the opportunity to make the case for why they should emerge as one of the campus&#8217;s academic priority areas. We want these academic areas to emerge organically, and then we want to understand what each group would need to best support its efforts.</p>
<p>Each group will be asked to produce a concise overview summarizing its plan and give a brief presentation at an open-campus forum in April. Both the overview documents and the presentations will be reviewed and assessed by the campus community, Academic Senate, and our deans. Our consultants also will conduct external research to test and, ideally, validate our assumptions. All review comments will be forwarded to the Academic Advisory Committee for further analysis and prioritization and, ultimately, submitted to the CP/EVC and Chancellor for the final determination of priority areas. <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/get-involved.html">Click here</a> to learn how you can get involved.</p>
<h4>INTERVIEWING</h4>
<p>Our consultants recently conducted in-depth, one-on-one interviews with 25 students. The aim was to understand why they picked UC Santa Cruz; what their experiences have been since their arrival; the ways in which we have served them well; and how we might improve. Results will be posted as soon as they are compiled. We also gathered key insights on the student experience from a recent open forum dedicated to students. Students praised a number of campus support organizations, lauded the overall quality of their majors, and noted that their decision to attend UC Santa Cruz often hinged on their personal connections to the campus. They also listed a number of ways in which we could work to improve their experience including more extensive disciplinary training for TAs, enhanced support for gateway courses, more coordinated support for first-generation students, and attention to various campus-climate issues.</p>
<h4>ENGAGING</h4>
<p>We&#8217;re gratified that last week&#8217;s open forums drew engaged participants from across campus. We held seven two-hour sessions to give faculty, staff, and students the chance to share ideas on, and ask questions about, the SAP process. Audiences were clear in their hope that we&#8217;ll implement our plan, engage a broad cross-section of stakeholders for input, and communicate clearly about what we will implement and on what timeline. All told, more than 150 people participated. Thanks to all those who made time for the forums!</p>
<h4>SURVEYING</h4>
<p>Late last month we wrapped up our Faculty Insights Survey, which asked our Senate faculty to weigh in on the most promising existing and emerging areas of research on campus. Roughly 20 themes emerged. Among them: biomedical, data science, digital humanities, economic justice, the future of earth and humanity, cultural heritage and public history, materials science and engineering, social mobility and economic opportunity, and water justice. The initial list will provide a starting place for our Themed Academic Working Groups. To learn more about the groups, <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/get-involved.html">click here</a>.</p>
<h4>LISTENING</h4>
<p>Executive Vice Chancellor and Campus Provost Marlene Tromp will take questions on the strategic academic planning process at the Feb. 21 Academic Senate meeting. It gets underway at 2:30 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center. Please plan on attending.</p>
<h4>LOOKING AHEAD</h4>
<p>A Future State Design workshop&#8212;the first of a number of sessions designed to help us come to consensus on a broad theme for the campus around which we can coalesce&#8212;is set for 1:30&#8211;5 p.m. Tuesday, March 20, in 108 Digital Arts Research Center (DARC). <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwpapcOVSm5irRpQQjwqHgHgv43BqSiARYydmShIO2Mlnybg/viewform">Please RSVP here</a> by March 15, and mark your calendar to join the conversation.</p>

Twenty minutes with a book under the cherry trees outside McHenry Library. A stop at the Market Cart at the base of campus for fresh-from-the-farm fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>What do all these things have in common? They, and activities like them, are essential elements of a balanced, healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>I very much value the work done by all of our faculty and staff, and the effort put forth by our students. We wouldn&#8217;t be the university we are without all of your incredible contributions. But living a fulfilling life requires &#8220;work&#8221; in many different areas.</p>
<p>I firmly believe we need daily practices and behaviors that address body, mind and spirit. That balance might involve a daily walk around campus or a noontime meditation session, a workshop on tackling stress or one on getting your personal finances in order. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve always been a big supporter of our campus wellness programs, which aim to help our students, staff, and faculty find the proper work-life balance.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s my pleasure to let the campus community know about a wonderful opportunity to expand our wellness offerings. UC President Janet Napolitano a year ago announced the launch of the Healthy Campus Network, a systemwide initiative that seeks to make campuses the healthiest places possible to work, learn, and live. The network, among other things, supports the enhancement and expansion of current campus health-and-wellness efforts for students, staff and faculty. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m writing to you today.</p>
<p>Our campus has $140,000 in grant funding available, with a maximum grant of $5,000, to support new or existing campus-based activities that boost campus wellness. The term &#8220;wellness,&#8221; of course, can be interpreted widely. There are so many facets to a healthy life. To make it easier, and to define the term, we&#8217;re seeking innovative ideas that increase student, staff and faculty health in these specific areas: emotional, spiritual, environmental, financial-occupational, physical, social, cultural and nutritional.</p>
<p>These grants will also allow us to build on, and draw attention to, some of the great programs we already have in place.</p>

The 2017 edition was even bigger and better, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising more than $520,000 for 122 worthy projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the organizers of this free-spirited and imaginative give-fest are back for round three: &#160;</span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day 2018, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">an expanded and amped-up version that will once again allow teams of fundraisers to compete, good-naturedly, against one another for top honors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour festival takes place on February 28. As the hours and minutes tick by, donors will try to outdo one another. Think of it as a day-long marathon of giving that ends with a hundred-yard dash to the finish line. Last year&#8217;s top challenge winner was &#160;Formula Slug, a student-run, nonprofit sustainable engineering organization that won the &#8220;Mad Dash&#8221; Challenge, adding $2,500 to their project, as well as the Final Frenzy Challenge and bonus $10,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day is a time for the campus community to come together in a circle of giving. Donors give through </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a special Giving Day website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tracks gifts in real time so everyone can see right away how each project is faring as they compete for matches and &#8220;challenge gifts.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This user-friendly web page includes an ever-ticking countdown clock, as well as a </span><a href="https://ucsc-communications.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GD/pages/34720291/Training+Resources"><span style="font-weight: 400;">training toolkit page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with links to presentations. Teams of donors hope to meet, or exceed, the breadth and depth of last year&#8217;s version.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small sampling of this year&#8217;s projects includes the African American Resource &amp; Cultural Center, the Alumni Association Scholarship, the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division, the Ballroom Dance Club, Emergency Medical Slugs, the Fighting Slugs Marching Band, KZSC 88.1 FM Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, Shakespeare to Go, Slug Gaming, Sisterhood in STEM, UC Santa Cruz Campus Natural Reserve, and UC Santa Cruz Hackathon. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Giving Day is certainly growing on itself each year,&#8221; said Alexis Geers, assistant director of annual giving and project management at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;While the day is focused on helping projects raise funds, the real key is to spread the word about what their projects are and encourage people to participate in any way they can. This can mean giving a donation of $5, or it could mean being an advocate of a project by spreading the word.&#8221;</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emphasis is on fun as well as generosity. Throughout this intensive 24-hour period, online donors can support any campus fund they wish, whether or not it is a featured project on the website. Gifts can also be made in person, by phone, or by check</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#160;</span></i></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Geers also mentioned the burgeoning number of participants. In 2016, Giving Day benefitted&#160;68 projects. Last year, the number increased to 122. This year, 175 projects will take part in Giving day. The number of donors has also grown year by year, showing that the culture of philanthropy has been spreading and increasing across campus, Geers said. </span>

(Photo courtesy of Courtney Zuniga)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For Courtney Zuniga, the sight of powerful women like Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi made a lasting impression during her Fall Quarter UCDC internship in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Zuniga spent last fall as an intern for Pelosi (D-San Francisco), Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives and former Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>"Going to Washington and seeing so many women in powerful positions&#8212;so many women commanding respect, saying 'I am here because of who I am, and you'll give me respect'&#8212;it was very uplifting," said Zuniga, whose long-term career goal is to be an advocate for women and children.</p>
<p>About 25 undergraduates from each campus enroll in the systemwide <a href="https://politics.ucsc.edu/undergraduate/ucdc/">UCDC program</a> each quarter, studying and working in the capital. Zuniga chose Capitol Hill, but other students land internships in government agencies, cultural institutions, nonprofits, and media outlets.</p>
<p>Zuniga applied for internships with Pelosi, California senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.</p>
<p>"Ninety percent of UCDC students apply to work with Kamala Harris&#8212;she gets 3,000 applications nationwide and only takes about eight students! The Leader gets about 300 and takes six," said Zuniga, who refers to Pelosi by her title as Democratic Leader of the House. Zuniga received offers from both California senators and said choosing was "the hardest decision."</p>
<p>"The House sees a lot more action than the Senate side, and I wanted to work with one of the most powerful women ever to work in Congress," she said.</p>
<p><strong>More than answering phones</strong></p>
<p>As an intern, Zuniga often attended briefings on behalf of staff, writing detailed memos on tight deadlines for legislative directors who couldn't attend in person. She attended briefings on a diverse range of topics, including Tibet, human organ harvesting in China, and human sex trafficking in the United States. "I thought I'd be answering phones and greeting visitors, but they have staff for that," she said. Zuniga, who loves to write, also took a UCDC research seminar taught by John Lawrence, who was Pelosi's chief of staff when she was Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>The workload was heavy but not unusual for Zuniga, who takes four classes a quarter, works 20 hours a week in the Express Store at Quarry Plaza, interns off campus, and juggles extracurricular activities like Student Union Assembly. She will graduate this spring with a double major in legal studies and sociology after only three years on campus.</p>
<p>Zuniga will be a second-generation college graduate; raised by her mother, Zuniga was a child when her mother enrolled at UC Riverside, then went on to earn a master's and Ph.D. in psychology. Watching her mother struggle financially and seeing her mistreated because she was a woman had a lasting impact on Zuniga. "When I was little, my mom was a bill collector for a trailer park, and today she's a psychologist," said Zuniga. "My mom's my idol."</p>
<p><strong>Back on campus</strong></p>
<p>Back on campus this winter, Zuniga is writing her senior thesis about the second amendment and gun control. She was in Washington when 58 people were killed and 851 injured in the Las Vegas shooting. "That was the biggest mass shooting in history. We've become used to it," she said, lamenting the fact that no gun-control legislation has been approved since 2000.</p>
<p>She is also doing a Legal Studies internship with <a href="http://www.scdefenders.com/">Santa Cruz Public Defenders</a>, where she assists investigators by interviewing witnesses in a range of cases, including domestic violence and sexual violence. Complainants are sometimes reluctant to cooperate, which has required Zuniga to hone her powers of persuasion when reaching out.</p>
<p>"Our job is to see what happened, good or bad," she said. "I love people. I love listening to people's stories and connecting with people. It's very interesting to see this side of law and politics."</p>
<p><strong>Graduating in three years</strong></p>
<p>When Zuniga thinks about her three years at UC Santa Cruz, she would be the first to say it hasn't always been easy.</p>
<p>"Freshman year was hard&#8212;it's the hardest," she said, recalling the trepidation she felt about being labeled "the weird girl with the dog," because she brought an emotional support animal&#8212;Cupcake, a teacup poodle&#8212;to campus. She credits a women's group facilitated by Blair Davis in Counseling and Psychological Services with helping her meet new friends and find her footing.</p>
<p>Zuniga is also a big proponent of keeping busy. During her sophomore year, she was the outreach and engagement coordinator for the Student Union Assembly (SUA), where she focused on public awareness campaigns around student mental health and sexual assault on college campuses. SUA is where Zuniga met Kylie Carpenter (College Ten '17, history; legal studies minor). "She did UCDC and interned with Congresswoman Barbara Lee," said Zuniga. "She worked on Capitol Hill, and she spurred that in me."</p>
<p>Applying to UCDC is "really intense, it's a huge application," and Zuniga didn't make the initial cut. "I was waitlisted," she said. "That stung."</p>
<p>But that wasn't the end of the story. Today, Zuniga finds inspiration on her forearm, where the word "strong" is tattooed in delicate cursive. "I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason," she said. "Things always work out."</p>

<p>The lecture is the public component of the Faculty Research Award, the highest honor bestowed on faculty members by their peers in the Academic Senate. Walsh's talk, entitled "From the Great Inflation to the Great Recession and Beyond: The Interplay of Monetary Theory and Policy," will begin at 7 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall. The talk is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Walsh, an expert on central banking and monetary policy, will discuss the impact of academic research in monetary economics and the actions of central banks&#8212;and vice versa.</p>
<p>"Over the past 50 years, the U.S. and other industrialized economies have experienced the Great Inflation of the 1970s, the Great Moderation that stretched from the mid-1980s to 2007, and the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008-09," said Walsh. "The actions of central banks such as the Federal Reserve during each of these episodes have been influenced by academic research&#8212;and research has been affected by lessons drawn from policy actions."</p>
<p>Walsh will trace the two-way interactions that have played out over five decades and discuss the implications for business cycles, unemployment, and inflation of today's environment, in which monetary theory and policy are divorced from money.</p>
<p>Walsh is one of the world's leading researchers in the field of monetary theory and monetary policy. His scholarship on central bank governance, optimal monetary policy, and inflation targeting have helped set the research agenda for monetary economists for more than 30 years. In addition, he has played an influential role in the way the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and central banks abroad conduct monetary policy.</p>
<p>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2004 called a paper by Walsh "one of the three most influential papers in macroeconomics over the past 25 years." That paper, about optimal contracts for central bankers, is now known as the "Walsh Contract." Tony Blair's government cited a 1995 Walsh paper as it reformed the Bank of England.</p>
<p>Before joining the Economics Department in 1987, Walsh served as a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, where he has since worked as a visiting scholar. He is the author of the graduate-level textbook&#160;<em>Monetary Theory and Policy</em>, now in its fourth edition, as well as the classic undergraduate textbook <em>Economics</em>, coauthored with Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="77da0308807270176c500acff978d913"><name>lusztig-film-premiere</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Arts professor to premiere film at 2018 Berlin International Film Festival</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor Irene Lusztig will premiere her new film, 'Yours in Sisterhood,' at the 2018 Berlinale, running February 15-25 in Berlin, Germany.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, uc santa cruz film department, uc santa cruz arts division</keywords><start-date>1518137400000</start-date><display-name>Arts professor to premiere film at 2018 Berlin International Film Festival</display-name><path>/2018/02/lusztig-film-premiere</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/lusztig-film-premiere</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1518134230734</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518138133958</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/lusztig-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/lusztig-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lusztig-400.jpg</name><display-name>lusztig-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>205495</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Irene Lusztig (photo by R.

<p>One of the world&#8217;s leading international film festivals, the annual event screens nearly 400 films each year of every length and format, attracting visitors from more than 100 countries.</p>
<p><em>Yours in Sisterhood</em> is a collective study of feminism--both now and four decades ago--that has recently taken on a new sense of urgency since the 2016 election. Between 2015 and 2017, Lusztig invited hundreds of strangers from communities across the United States to read aloud and respond to letters from the 1970s sent to the editor of <em>Ms. Magazine</em>, America&#8217;s first mainstream feminist magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent the summer of 2014 in the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America reading boxes containing thousands of these mostly unpublished letters to the editor,&#8221; said Lusztig. &#8220;What was most striking during my archival research is that the issues covered by these letters are still the same big issues that women and gender-nonconforming people are facing today--sexual harassment, violence, and assault, access to abortion and birth control, body image, workplace discrimination, gender and sexuality, race, class, and inclusivity."</p>
<p>&#8220;Inspired by these incredible letters, in the summer of 2015, I set off on a journey to share these letters with ordinary people all over the U.S. I wanted to know if this rich collective archive of everyday feminist history and experience could be a catalyst for a new kind of national conversation about feminism today.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the next two years, Lusztig filmed over 300 readings with volunteers in 32 different states across the country. Each project participant was matched with a 70s letter sent from their own city or town and invited to read aloud and respond to their letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I've filmed readings with people of all ages, gender identities, shapes, colors, and backgrounds on both coasts, in the Midwest, the Rockies, and the South, in remote rural areas and major cities,&#8221; Lusztig noted. &#8220;Filming these conversations with strangers alongside the election, its aftermath, the #metoo movement and much more, this project has felt increasingly timely and resonant--the stakes for how we create conversations about feminism right now feel higher and more urgent than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Born in England to Romanian parents, Lusztig grew up in Boston and has lived in France, Italy, Romania, China, and Russia. She received her BA in filmmaking and Chinese studies from Harvard and completed her MFA in film and video at Bard College.</p>
<p>Her work has been screened around the world in such venues as the Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Anthology Film Archives, Pacific Film Archive, IDFA Amsterdam, and on television in the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan. She is also the 2016-17 recipient of a Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship and a Fulbright Fellowship in Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Alex Johnston</strong> (Ph.D. Film &amp; Digital Media, 2017) will also have a film screened at the 2018 Berlinale. <em>Evidence of the Evidence</em> is about the 1971 Attica prison uprising. Utilizing rarely seen video recordings (produced by a New York State Trooper), the film offers a visceral ground level account of the events at Attica.</p>
<p>&#8220;Irene (Lusztig) was my primary creative advisor at UCSC, and has been a massive influence on my work as a filmmaker,&#8221; said Johnston. &#8220;The film I am screening at the Berlinale constituted a &#8216;visual&#8217; chapter in my recently completed dissertation,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Johnston&#8217;s work has screened at a wide range of venues, including the Cachoeira Doc Festival, San Francisco&#8217;s Other Cinema, the New Orleans Film Festival, Iowa City Documentary Film Festival, and the Miners' Colfax Medical Center, a convalescent home for retired hard rock and coal miners in Raton, New Mexico.</p>

achievements</article-subhead><article-text><p>Two engineers in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering, and Mart&#237;n Abadi, professor emeritus of computer science&#8212;have been elected to the <a href="https://www.nae.edu/">National Academy of Engineering</a> for their outstanding contributions to the field of engineering. Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very pleased that the outstanding contributions of David Haussler and Mart&#237;n Abadi have been recognized by the National Academy of Engineering,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;The work of these two faculty members exemplify the power and importance of engineering in our lives. Professor Haussler&#8217;s work has transformed the field of genomics, and Professor Abadi&#8217;s research helped form the foundations of computer security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haussler, the scientific director of the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>, was recognized by the academy &#8220;for developments in computational learning theory and bioinformatics, including first assembly of the human genome, its analysis, and data sharing.&#8221; He is a pioneer in genomics research and an international leader in efforts to advance genomic medicine. Haussler&#8217;s team, driven by then graduate student Jim Kent, posted the first publicly available assembly of the human genome sequence online in 2000 and subsequently developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a widely used tool for biomedical researchers. His group&#8217;s work in cancer genomics includes collaborations with cancer researchers at medical centers nationally on efforts to discover molecular causes of cancer and pioneer a new personalized, genomics-based approach to cancer treatment.</p>
<p>A Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator, Haussler has received many awards and honors for his work, including the 2015 Dan David Prize, the Weldon Memorial Prize given by the University of Oxford, and the ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Haussler joined the UCSC faculty in 1986.</p>
<p>Abadi was recognized by the academy &#8220;for contributions to the formal theory of computer security.&#8221; His research on computer and network security, programming languages, and specification and verification methods includes contributions to the design and analysis of security protocols and to the foundations of object-oriented programming languages. A fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, Abadi has been recognized by the ACM Special Interest Group on Security with its Outstanding Innovation Award and by the ACM Special Interest Group on Operating Systems with a Hall of Fame Award.</p>
<p>Abadi joined the UCSC faculty in 2001 and retired in 2013.

<p>"Humans and Wild Ecosystems in a Hot World" will take place on Wednesday, March 7, at 7 p.m. in the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz. The event is free and open to the public; <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2898&amp;cid=5195">advance registration</a> is required.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers Newton Harrison and Scott Wing will make individual remarks, followed by a moderated panel discussion that will include questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Harrison, who pioneered the ecological art movement four decades ago, is internationally renowned for work that addresses sweeping environmental challenges, including how urbanization and climate change are impacting ecosystems. Working at the intersection of art and science, Harrison&#8212;in partnership with his wife Helen&#8212;collaborates with biologists, ecologists, architects, planners, and politicians to expand dialogue and change public policy. The Harrisons' highly acclaimed body of work includes <em>The Force Majeure</em>, which focuses on rising water levels and temperatures around the world. Now an eminent professor of art at UC Santa Cruz, Harrison continues to work where the forces of conservation collide with exploitation, most recently on forest systems. <a href="https://brooklynrail.org/special/RIVER_RAIL/river-rail/Saving-the-West"><em>Saving the West</em></a> seeks to help forest systems adapt to climate change by reducing fire danger and protecting water supplies.</p>
<p>Scott Wing is a biologist who explores evolution, ecology, and climate change at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, where he is curator of fossil plants. His research focuses on the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic, a period of globally warm climate beginning 150 million year ago when flowering plants were emerging as the dominant form of terrestrial life. He has long worked to uncover the causes and effects of a sudden global warming event that occurred 56 million years ago that has many similarities to current, human-caused changes in the atmosphere and climate. His research is based largely on fieldwork and analysis of fossil plants. For the last six years, Wing has been on the core team planning the new permanent fossil hall at the Smithsonian, the largest and most complex renovation in the museum's history. The hall will reopen in 2019.</p>
<p>Following their individual presentations, Harrison and Wing will be joined in conversation with moderator Paul Koch, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences and dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. Susan Solt, dean of the Arts Division and distinguished professor of theater arts, will give concluding remarks.</p>
<p>"As befits the scope of the challenge of climate change, this program showcases the talented people across the disciplines who are grappling with this issue," said Katharyne Mitchell, professor of sociology and dean of the Division of Social Sciences, who will introduce the program. "I look forward to an enlightening evening."</p>
<p>This annual conference is being cosponsored this year by three academic divisions: Arts, Social Sciences, and Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>

It was a dangerous break with frigid water, jagged rocks, and powerful waves that could reach 60 to 100 feet in height. The break had already claimed one life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gerhardt bobbed on her surfboard, she had no idea that, a few months later, she would become the first woman to surf the legendary break&#8212;although someone else in the water that day did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I saw her sitting in the channel and I paddled up and asked her what was going on, and she said she was just watching her husband, Mike,&#8221; remembered Frosty Hesson, a legendary big-wave surfer and mentor whose life was portrayed by Gerard Butler in the 2012 movie </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chasing Mavericks.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I told her, well, I don&#8217;t know you but I know that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m seeing,&#8221; Hesson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he saw instead, he said in a telephone interview from his Soquel home, was &#160;&#8220;analysis and inquiry and questioning and resolve.&#8221; She was studying the waves, cataloging them. Later that day, Hesson said, he told board shaper Bob Pearson he&#8217;d just met the woman who would be the first female to ride Mavericks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 1999, that&#8217;s exactly what Gerhardt did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me,&#8221; Hesson said, &#8220;it was impressive that she didn&#8217;t paddle right over to catch a wave or tuck tail and run that first day; that instead she built this data bank of information and I think that really speaks to who she is.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk to Gerhardt and you&#8217;ll find the roots of what Hesson saw that day: an independent woman shaped by the poverty, illness, and sometimes homelessness of her family. A strong woman who found her place in the water, who became one of the top female big&#8211;wave riders just for the joy of it, and a chemistry professor who earned her Ph.D. in physical chemistry from UC Santa Cruz in 2003. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This winter, she also may well be one of the first women to compete in the spot&#8217;s infamous contest, now called the Mavericks Challenge and organized by the World Surfing League. It will be the first time a women&#8217;s heat will be included in the contest, which has been held only 10 times since the inaugural competition in 1999 because conditions haven&#8217;t always been good enough to hold the event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers have until Feb. 28 to run the contest under optimal conditions of big waves and mild weather. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting in the backyard of her Westside home and watching over her 12-year-old daughter&#8217;s new kitten, Gerhardt said she grew up on the beaches of Hawaii, but not in the charming way of movies. Her father had taken the family to the Big Island to study astronomy, but because they had no money, they ate, slept, and lived on the beach, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, disabling symptoms of a form of muscular dystrophy put her mother in a wheelchair and turned Gerhardt and her sister into their mother&#8217;s chief caretakers. The family had moved to California at this point, and during the first five months of Gerhardt&#8217;s freshman year of high school in Pismo Beach, she and her mother were homeless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water became her refuge from caregiving duties, from the allergies and asthma that plagued her onshore, from the rough edges of her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Surfing was my home,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I found freedom on a lot of levels out in the water.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, she fell in with a group of talented male surfers, including her now-husband Mike Gerhardt, and was soon riding giant waves: 25 feet, 30 feet, 45 feet. They sounded like freight trains and moved with an intensity that set hearts racing and adrenaline pumping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrie Williams, UC Santa Cruz professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, once strapped a heart monitor on Gerhardt as she rode the waves at Mavericks. The monitor recorded a sustained heart rate of more than 180 beats per minute&#8212;or 90 percent of maximum&#8212;for an entire three-hour session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The heart of a Mavericks surfer is like a cheetah on steroids,&#8221; Williams was quoted as saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very focused feeling,&#8221; said Gerhardt who compares big-wave surfing to a ride on the Giant Dipper&#8212;if the roller coaster track was also moving and you couldn&#8217;t be guaranteed to be in one piece at the end. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I love about it. I&#8217;m very focused on the present moment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to be in that moment takes a lot of preparation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerhardt runs, mountain bikes, swims in the UC Santa Cruz masters program, and does yoga once a week. On the day of the interview she&#8217;d done sit-ups, lunges, squats, and pull-ups before going for a run and then getting in the water later to surf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, most importantly, she also takes stock of her mental state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She runs through a Mavericks session beforehand, imagining how she will feel the lift of the water, how she will paddle into the wave, how she will leap to her feet. She writes in her journal and reads the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I also make sure my heart is in the right place and that I&#8217;m coming from a place of honesty,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I try to be humble and not be driven by ego or pride. Instead, I want to be driven by a desire to go out there and experience life to the fullest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That desire to live a full life also extends to her husband and two children, and is what brings her into the classroom, first at Monterey Peninsula College and now at Cabrillo Community College. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wants to expose students to the beauty and practicality of chemistry and also to help them acquire the skills necessary for learning, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Gerhardt is waiting for the go-signal to see if she will seal another place in history&#8212;one of the first women to surf in the all-male Mavericks contest&#8212;but she is also living her life as mother, wife, teacher, and athlete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She broke off the conversation to rescue the wandering kitten from a tree and then excused herself. She didn&#8217;t want to be late for the women&#8217;s march. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/healthy-hearts.html</url><title>Dogs, cats, and big-wave surfers: Healthy heart lessons from animals and athletes</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7cb45989807270176c500acf423dbae4"><name>coral-reefs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Innovative restoration of coral reefs helps protect Caribbean islands</title><summary>Study shows direct link between healthy coral reefs and shoreline stability and field-tests an innovative risk-reduction solution that combines engineering with reef restoration.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck</keywords><start-date>1518451200000</start-date><display-name>Innovative restoration of coral reefs helps protect Caribbean islands</display-name><path>/2018/02/coral-reefs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/coral-reefs</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1518215648557</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518457098730</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/reef-structure-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/reef-structure-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reef-structure-400.jpg</name><display-name>reef-structure-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>89405</file-size><width>400</width><height>283</height></image><image-alt>reef restoration structure</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/shoreline-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/shoreline-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shoreline-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>shoreline-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23187</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>eroding shoreline</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Pilot structures installed in Grenville Bay, Granada, can provide protection from coastal erosion and help to restore degraded coral reefs.

Researchers at UC Santa Cruz and the Nature Conservancy have now measured the protective role of coral reefs and field-tested a solution that reduces coastal risks by combining innovative engineering with restoration ecology.</p>
<p>Working in Grenville Bay, Grenada, the researchers showed that degradation of coral reefs is directly linked to shoreline erosion and coastal flooding in parts of the bay. The study, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479718300240">published February 1 in the <em>Journal of Environmental Management</em></a>, also evaluates one of the first uses of reef restoration as natural infrastructure specifically designed to reduce risks to people and property.</p>
<p>Investigating the link between healthy reefs and shoreline stability, the researchers found that Grenville&#8217;s healthy reefs keep more than half of the bay&#8217;s coastline intact by reducing the wave energy arriving on shore. In contrast, severe reef degradation is linked with chronic coastal erosion in the northern section of the bay, where the shoreline is disappearing at a rate of nearly two feet every year.</p>
<p>In an attempt to adapt, villagers have built makeshift barriers with tires and driftwood to slow the erosion threatening their homes, but these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. The reef restoration project was designed to enhance both the ecological functions of natural reef habitat and its protective effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are able to apply coastal engineering tools and models to support reef science and management. Ours is one of the first studies to directly show with evidence from the field sites and engineering models the impacts of reef loss on shorelines,&#8221; said lead author Borja Reguero, a researcher at the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Coastal resilience</strong></p>
<p>The study was part of an innovative coral reef restoration project called <a href="http://coastalresilience.org/project/grenada-at-the-waters-edge/">At the Water's Edge</a> (AWE), a community-based initiative led by the Nature Conservancy to increase coastal resilience to climate change. The researchers field-tested a reef-based breakwater structure that represents one of the few existing examples of reef restoration designed to increase community resilience and decrease vulnerability. The aim is to facilitate the recovery of the coral reef and to directly reduce coastal erosion and flooding. With support from the German Federal Foreign Office and in partnership with Grenada Fund for Conservation, Grenada Red Cross Society, and community members, the pilot reef-based breakwater structure was formally launched in early January 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grenada has been at the front lines of climate change both in impacts and importantly as a leader among small islands and developing states in addressing these problems,&#8221; said AWE project lead Nealla Frederick.</p>
<p>The reef restoration structure is made from inexpensive and locally-sourced materials and labor, easy to assemble on-site, suitable for high wave energy or hurricane exposure, and specially designed to encourage habitat restoration and enhancement. Live coral fragments from the existing reef were placed onto the structure to encourage natural reef growth. This approach is designed to be replicated in small island communities, which are often the most susceptible to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>According to coauthor Michael Beck, lead marine scientist at the Nature Conservancy and research professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, a growing body of scientific studies and project-based experience shows that coastal habitats such as coral reefs, oyster reefs, mangroves, wetlands, and dunes can offer cost-effective protection from the increasing impacts of climate change. This study builds on that knowledge, highlighting the potential and importance of prioritizing and investing in coastal habitats as effective and cost-effective natural infrastructure, he said. Island nations can meet their adaptation and hazard mitigation goals by investing in nature-based defenses, to significantly increase their coastal resilience and reduce the growing economic and human losses caused by coastal hazards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reef degradation destroys the natural breakwaters for tropical coastlines in the United States and across more than 60 other nations. Our study identifies how severe this problem can be, and we used that information to design an innovative reef restoration solution to help people and nature,&#8221; Beck said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7d181e5c807270176c500acfd5d59ddd"><name>mlk-convocation-crenshaw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>MLK Convocation: For racial equality, we must hear women</title><summary>Kimberlé Crenshaw, a law professor known for the development of intersectional theory, praised the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. but noted that the civil rights movement and the Obama era left out the perspectives and voices of women.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the lights came up and Kimberl&#233; Crenshaw exited the stage, the raucous applause from a packed house at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium was a reliable indicator of the power and insight contained in the speech she&#8217;d just delivered. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s what happens when you bring it,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz professor David Anthony, who hosted the annual UC Santa Cruz Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation on Thursday night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crenshaw, a professor at UCLA and Columbia Law School known for the development of intersectional theory, was the keynote speaker for the event and framed the majority of her speech as an imagined dialogue between the ghost of King and contemporary feminist civil rights leader Barbara Arnwine, both of whom are chagrined at the current state of affairs in the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a challenge to speak about the legacy of Dr. King in the midst of what is probably the most profound unraveling of the racial justice agenda that we&#8217;ve seen since the end of Reconstruction,&#8221; Crenshaw said in her prefatory remarks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her half-hour address was full of force and imagination, but Crenshaw didn&#8217;t shy from offering a stinging critique of King and his movement, and what she deemed its &#8220;intersectional failures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At times reading like a play, Crenshaw used the voice of Arnwine to channel her own frustration with the limitations of the 1960s civil rights movement, the Obama era, and their combined inability to incorporate the perspectives and voices of women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These intersectional failures set the stage for the weakened position that we are in today,&#8221; Crenshaw said. &#8220;Then, as well as now, the consequence of this male-exclusive focus on racial justice was to naturalize patriarchy as the point of departure for racial equity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crenshaw criticized King&#8217;s position that a better future for black children in America relied on the promulgation of traditional family values, encouraged by job programs for black men. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No one seemed to notice that the best way to secure the social and economic well-being of children of color is to secure the social and economic well-being of their mothers,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not to say Crenshaw was dismissive of King, his contributions, or the applicability of his legacy to the current times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crenshaw praised King for his stand against the Vietnam War despite contemporary criticism from within the civil rights movement, saying it represented intersectionality by recognizing the principles of American imperialism were equally pernicious whether applied at home or abroad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crenshaw&#8217;s critiques were not restricted to the 1960s either, as she decried the male-exclusive focus of former President Barack Obama&#8217;s foremost racial equality initiative My Brother&#8217;s Keeper. She further said that declarations of a post-racial society in America that greeted Obama&#8217;s election led to a relaxation in vigilance that played a role in fostering our contemporary cultural conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some people are so convinced we are moving forward, that we haven&#8217;t noticed we are passing through the same terrain we passed before,&#8221; Crenshaw said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Crenshaw and many other speakers who participated in the convocation, that terrain is the Trump era, which they said provides a stark contrast the principles of inclusion and fellowship espoused by King. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just a year removed from our country&#8217;s first black president we&#8217;ve seen bias, hate, and racism veer from society&#8217;s margins toward the mainstream,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal during introductory remarks. &#8220;Instead of a leader uniting us behind our common humanity, we find a president who is willing to stoke the fires of division for political gain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Elena De La Garza, who received the Tony Hill Award for Community Service during the convocation, described an ICE raid in Watsonville the day before, and asked her listeners to imagine the fear felt by the children who are watching their parents ripped out of cars and taken away to uncertain futures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Resist,&#8221; said De La Garza, who is executive director of the Community Action Board of Watsonville. &#8220;Be resilient. Be an action and do something good. With me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crenshaw also called for action, citing King as the necessary conduit for the hope that dedicated action and diligence can create change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see my dream is far from realized,&#8221; Crenshaw said, once more invoking the spirit of the great civil rights icon. &#8220;But I see that hope has not expired but has been renewed again as fuel for change.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Crenshaw added that such change will only come by recognizing and honoring the tapestry of interwoven identities of the participants in the movement&#8212;a movement that must incorporate women, their perspectives, their voices, and their unique travails in order to progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re tired of being the wheels on this bus, it&#8217;s time for us to be in the driver&#8217;s seat,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The drip, drip, drip of trickle-down social justice is not the cadence we need to be marching to.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual convocation, which celebrated its 34 anniversary this year, honors the life and dream of Martin Luther King Jr. by presenting speakers who discuss the civil rights issues of equality, freedom, justice, and opportunity. It also seeks to build partnerships and develop dialogue within the campus and local community. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="869e6856807270176c500acf9d9fb243"><name>silver-slug</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC Retirees Association to award first 'Silver Slug' scholarship for staff and dependents</title><summary>The Silver Slug Award is a newly endowed scholarship created by the UC Santa Cruz Retirees Association to support staff and their dependents seeking a degree at UCSC.</summary><start-date>1518336000000</start-date><display-name>Silver Slug scholarship</display-name><path>/2018/02/silver-slug</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/silver-slug</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1518381982781</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518581815284</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioweb@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The Silver Slug Award is a newly endowed scholarship created by the UC Santa Cruz Retirees Association to support staff and their dependents seeking a degree at UCSC.<br/><br/>The award will provide up to $2,000 during the 2018-19 academic year for the selected candidate.

The images reveal features of the fault surface, including long grooves or corrugations, that may determine how the fault will slip in an earthquake.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0061-4">published February 12 in <em>Nature Geoscience</em></a>, focused on the Costa Rica subduction zone where the Cocos plate slowly dives beneath the overriding Caribbean plate. Variations in texture seen in different portions of the fault surface may explain why Costa Rica has complex, patchy earthquakes that do not seem to slip to shallow depths, unlike some other megathrust faults, said first author Joel Edwards, a Ph.D. candidate in Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our new imagery shows large variability in the conditions along the megathrust, which may be linked to a number of earthquake phenomena we observe in the region,&#8221; Edwards said.</p>
<p><strong>Great earthquakes</strong></p>
<p>Megathrusts, the huge continuous faults found in subduction zones, are responsible for Earth's largest earthquakes. Megathrust earthquakes can generate destructive tsunamis and are a serious hazard facing communities located near subduction zones. Understanding the mechanisms at work along these faults is vital for disaster management around the globe.</p>
<p>Edwards worked with a team of geophysicists at UC Santa Cruz, the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Texas-Austin, and McGill University to obtain 3-dimensional imagery of the fault interface using cutting-edge acoustic imaging technology. The long grooves, or corrugations, they observed along the interface are similar in size to those found along the base of fast-flowing glaciers and along some ocean ridges. The images also showed varying amounts of smoothness and corrugations on different portions of the fault.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study produced an unprecedented view of the megathrust. Such 3-D information is critical to our ability to better understand megathrust faults and associated hazards worldwide,&#8221; said coauthor Jared Kluesner, a geophysicist at the USGS in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The acoustic dataset was collected in spring 2011 on the academic research vessel <em>Marcus G. Langseth</em>. The ship towed an array of underwater microphones and sound sources behind it as it made a series of overlapping loops over the area of the fault. The data were processed over the next 2 years and have since been used in a number of studies looking at different aspects of the subduction zone process. This particular study focused on the interface between the sliding plates, which serves as a record of slip and slip processes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 3-D site selection was really good and the resulting acoustic dataset showed extraordinary detail,&#8221; said Edwards, noting that coauthor Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, was the first to recognize the corrugations. Such features had been observed in exposed faults on land, but never before in a fault deep beneath the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had an early rendition of the interface that vaguely showed long grooves, and during my qualifying exam, Brodsky saw them and asked, &#8216;are those corrugations!?&#8217; I didn&#8217;t know, but I knew they were real features. Slip-derived corrugations was a really neat hypothesis, and we dug into it after that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Target for drilling</strong></p>
<p>The area in this study had long been a target for drilling into the megathrust by the Costa Rica Seismic Project (CRISP). Coauthor Eli Silver, professor emeritus of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, and others in the CRISP program decided to pursue a 3-D seismic study, which must precede any deep drilling, and the project was funded by the National Science Foundation in 2009. &#8220;At present, two drilling expeditions have been accomplished with shallower targets, and, though not yet scheduled, we are hopeful that the deep drilling will occur,&#8221; Silver said.</p>
<p>Researchers hope to use similar imaging techniques on other subduction zones, such as the Cascadia margin along the northern U.S. west coast, where there is a long history of large megathrust earthquakes and related tsunamis. &#8220;Conducting this type of 3-D study along the Cascadia margin could provide us with key information along the megathrust, a plate boundary that poses a substantial hazard risk to the U.S. west coast,&#8221; Kluesner said.</p>
<p>In addition to Edwards, Kluesner, Silver, and Brodksy, the coauthors of the paper include Danny Brothers at the USGS; Nathan Bangs at University of Texas, Austin; Jamie Kirkpatrick at McGill University; and Ruby Wood and Kristina Okamoto, both undergraduates at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b1014d8807270176c500acf06de31c8"><name>care-director</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New director named for Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education (CARE) office</title><summary>Kelsey Hoie Ferrell joined UC Santa Cruz as the new CARE director December 4, 2017.</summary><start-date>1518224400000</start-date><display-name>New CARE director named</display-name><path>/2018/02/care-director</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/care-director</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1518456541366</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518462219107</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am pleased to announce that we have hired our new director for Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education program&#8212;CARE.<br/><br/>After an extensive search, Kelsey Hoie Ferrell joined our staff as the new CARE director December 4, 2017.

<p>The UCSC team, called SlugBots, is one of eight university teams sponsored by Amazon to try to develop a "socialbot" that can converse coherently with humans using Alexa, the voice-controlled digital assistant in Amazon's Echo and other devices. Amazon is giving each of the teams a $250,000 research grant, Alexa-enabled devices, free Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support their development efforts, and access to other tools, data, and Alexa team support.</p>
<p>The team with the highest-performing socialbot will win a $500,000 prize. An additional $1 million research grant will be awarded to the winning team's university if their socialbot achieves the grand challenge of conversing coherently and engagingly with humans for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Walker's SlugBot team also competed in last year's inaugural Alexa Prize competition, which was won by a team at the University of Washington. None of the teams were able to achieve the grand challenge. The 2018 SlugBot team includes two students from last year's team, team leader Kevin Bowden and tech leader Jiaqi Wu, and three new members, Jurik Juraska, Vrindavan Harrison, and Wen Cui.</p>
<p>Walker heads the <a href="https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/">Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab</a> in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. The lab focuses on computational modeling of dialogue and user generated content in social media, such as weblogs and online chat forums, as well as the generation of expressive dialogue for conversational agents for a range of applications, including human-robot dialogue, storytelling agents and tourist information systems.</p>
<p>Much of the work in Walker's lab is data driven and involves mining social media to compile a large database of examples of social language and casual dialogue, and then analyzing and annotating them so they can be used to train computer algorithms using machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>The SlugBots approach builds on the ongoing work in Walker's lab on various aspects of what is sometimes called "conversational artificial intelligence." Live interactions and feedback from Alexa's large user base will help the team test ideas and develop their algorithms.</p>
<p>A primary goal of the Alexa Prize is to advance the science of conversational AI. To this end, the Alexa Prize Proceedings publishes each team's research resulting from their pursuit of the challenge. Papers from 2017 participants are available <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexaprize/proceedings">here</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b68dad3807270176c500acfa943fdd2"><name>bssw-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer science grad student wins Better Scientific Software Fellowship</title><summary>Ivo Jimenez was recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project in its inaugural class of Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellows.</summary><keywords>Ivo Jimenez</keywords><start-date>1518508800000</start-date><display-name>Computer science grad student wins Better Scientific Software Fellowship</display-name><path>/2018/02/bssw-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/bssw-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1518462359182</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518639827076</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/ivo-jimenez-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/ivo-jimenez-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ivo-jimenez-300.jpg</name><display-name>ivo-jimenez-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>45874</file-size><width>300</width><height>305</height></image><image-alt>Ivo Jimenez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/ivo-jimenez-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/ivo-jimenez-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ivo-jimenez-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ivo-jimenez-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15256</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ivo Jimenez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Ivo Jimenez</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ivo Jimenez, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at UC Santa Cruz, is one of four computer scientists (and the only graduate student) recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy's <a href="https://www.exascaleproject.org">Exascale Computing Project</a> in its inaugural class of Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellows.</p>
<p>The BSSw Fellowship Program was created to give recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software. The program aims to foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes. Each fellow will receive up to $10,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software.</p>
<p>Jimenez is a member of the <a href="https://systems.soe.ucsc.edu/">Systems Research Lab</a> directed by his adviser Carlos Maltzahn, adjunct professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering. As a BSSw Fellow, Jimenez will focus on the generation of computational experimentation pipelines that are easy to re-execute and validate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always been interested in the issues that arise at the intersection of scientific computing and software engineering practices. We want to make it easier for scientists to write better software and to share the code used in their research,&#8221; Jimenez said. He has been working with Maltzahn and others on a protocol and tool called <a href="http://falsifiable.us/">Popper</a> for conducting experiments and writing academic articles using software engineering best practices.</p>
<p>With the BSSw Fellowship, Jimenez will create an online tutorial on how to use Popper and organize training activities in the San Francisco Bay Area. He also plans to translate the content of the Popper tutorial into Spanish.</p>
<p>Originally from Mexico, Jimenez earned a B.S. in computer science at the University of Sonora. He came to the United States in 2006 and worked at HP Labs before pursuing his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Jimenez's work with Maltzahn has been supported in part by the UCSC <a href="https://cross.ucsc.edu/">Center for Research in Open Source Software</a> (CROSS) and by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

fellowships to UCSC biomedical researchers</article-subhead><article-text><p>Biomedical researchers at UC Santa Cruz have won major funding to investigate lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from the California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, which is supported by the state tax on cigarettes.</p>
<p>The awards include a $935,000 grant for research on lung cancer led by John MacMillan, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and a $550,000 grant for research on COPD led by Susan Carpenter, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology. In addition, Carrie Tambo and Alison Barrett, both graduate students working with professor of chemistry and biochemistry Seth Rubin, were awarded 3-year predoctoral fellowships of $180,000 each.</p>
<p>MacMillan's lab studies natural products derived from marine microbes, isolating and characterizing novel chemical compounds and investigating their therapeutic potential for treating cancer and other diseases. The new funding will support his research on marine natural products that show selective activity against lung cancers arising in nonsmokers. Lung cancers in nonsmokers have different genetic mutations than those in smokers and respond differently to drugs. MacMillan hopes to identify chemical agents that can be developed specifically as therapies for lung cancer in nonsmokers.</p>
<p>Carpenter's lab studies the role of the innate immune system in diseases involving inflammation. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD, a debilitating lung disease involving chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Carpenter will investigate molecular signals involved in the response of immune system cells called macrophages to cigarette smoke, and how this impacts COPD. In particular, she is interested in the role of RNA molecules known as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This work will provide insights into how innate immunity is affected by cigarette smoke, shed light on the pathogenesis of COPD, and potentially point to novel ways to treat this disease.</p>
<p>Barrett and Tambo will use their funding to support research projects involving tobacco-related lung cancer. Barrett is interested in a protein called E2F that turns on certain genes and is overactive in all forms of tobacco-related lung cancer. She will investigate a novel approach to controlling E2F which could have potential for development into a treatment for lung cancer. E2F is part of a signaling pathway that regulates cell division via the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). Tambo's project focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the Rb signaling pathway, specifically the activation step necessary for cell division. By determining structures of Rb protein complexes, she aims to help identify new inhibitors for treatment of tobacco-related lung cancer.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b9d5945807270176c500acf226f168a"><name>keynote-lrdp-senate</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Conversations with Chancellor George Blumenthal and CP/EVC Marlene Tromp</title><summary> Ólöf Einarsdottir, Chair, Academic Senate — The Feb. 21 Academic Senate meeting will focus on long range development planning and strategic academic planning. </summary><start-date>1518422400000</start-date><display-name>Keynote</display-name><path>/2018/02/keynote-lrdp-senate</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/keynote-lrdp-senate</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1518465799466</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518537264848</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ólöf Einarsdottir</name><title>Chair, Academic Senate</title><phone/><email>senate@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/olof-250px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/olof-250px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>olof-250px.jpg</name><display-name>olof-250px.jpg</display-name><file-size>39715</file-size><width>250</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt>Ólöf Einarsdottir</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The Feb. 21 Academic Senate meeting will focus on long range development planning and strategic academic planning. </article-subhead><article-text><p>The campus is currently developing a <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu/index.html">Long Range Development Plan</a> (LRDP) and a <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/index.html">Strategic Academic Plan</a> (SAP) and is engaging with various constituencies, including faculty, students, and staff. Because the LRDP touches on many issues that affect the broader Santa Cruz community&#8212;such as water use, traffic, and housing&#8212;the administration and LRDP co-chairs, Vice Chancellor for Business and Administrative Services Sarah Latham, and Senate Vice Chair Kimberly Lau, are also consulting with the Santa Cruz community and city leaders.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/lrdp-update.html">recent message</a> from the Chancellor, the LRDP is &#8220;not an OK for enrollment growth&#8221; but rather a land use plan that assesses the environmental impacts and related mitigations for different growth scenarios. The outer enrollment envelope the Chancellor has asked the LRDP Planning Committee to consider is 28,000 by the year 2040. According to the Chancellor, this number does not &#8220;come out of thin air&#8221; but is based on a combination of statewide growth, legislative and systemwide enrollment pressures, and an ongoing commitment to access and social justice.</p>
<p>The SAP is being led by the CP/EVC Marlene Tromp and Associate Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Martin Berger, and they have <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/comms-reports.html">sent out six updates</a> to the campus community on the progress of the SAP. To date, the SAP team has had interviews with numerous campus leaders, faculty, staff, and students; distributed a Faculty Insight survey; and held eight interactive forums for these constituents. The data that were collected have identified Thematic Academic Groups that will help facilitate faculty proposals about collaborative research and teaching across departments and divisions.

The findings support the idea that the area of large slip during a major earthquake is unlikely to rupture again for a substantial time.</p>
<p>The idea that earthquakes relieve stress on faults in the Earth's crust makes intuitive sense and underlies the common assumption that the portion of a fault that has just experienced an earthquake is relatively safe for some time. But not all studies have supported this, according to Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"This intuition has been challenged by statistical treatments of seismic data that indicate that, based on the clustering of earthquakes in space and time, the area that has just slipped is actually more likely to have another failure," Lay said. "The truth appears to be more nuanced. Yes, the area that slipped a lot is unlikely to slip again, as the residual stress on the fault has been lowered to well below the failure level, but the surrounding areas have been pushed toward failure in many cases, giving rise to aftershocks and the possibility of an adjacent large rupture sooner rather than later."</p>
<p>In the new study, published February 14 in <em>Science Advances</em>, Lay and other seismologists at UC Santa Cruz and Caltech took advantage of advanced slip-imaging methods applied to recent earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater. When they examined the locations of aftershocks with respect to the slip during the mainshock, they found that very few aftershocks occur in the regions of a fault that had a large amount of slip, and aftershocks that do occur in the slip zone tend to be weak, with negligible additional slip. Most aftershock activity occurs on the margins of the area that slipped in the mainshock.</p>
<p>"This produces a halo of aftershocks surrounding the rupture and indicates that the large-slip zone is not likely to have immediate rerupture," Lay said.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that the stress reduction during a major earthquake is large and pervasive over the ruptured surface of the fault. Stress will eventually build up again on that portion of the fault through frictional resistance to the gradual motions of the tectonic plates of Earth's crust, but that's a very slow process. Although immediate rerupture of the large-slip zone is unlikely, regional clustering of earthquakes is likely to occur due to the increased stress outside the main slip zone.</p>
<p>The findings also suggest that if unusually intense aftershock activity is observed within the high-slip zone, a larger earthquake in the immediate vicinity of the first event might still be possible. The authors noted that earthquake sequences are highly complex and involve variable amounts of slip and stress reduction.</p>
<p>In addition to Lay, the coauthors of the paper include first author Nadav Wetzler, a former postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz now at the Geological Survey of Israel; Emily Brodsky at UC Santa Cruz; and Hiroo Kanamori at the California Institute of Technology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91199ffc807270176c500acf85996660"><name>love-bank</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The Cowell College Love Bank</title><summary>When Rich Vicenti and Alesa Lightbourne were students at Cowell College in the 1970s, he courted her, but she was not available.

<p>The campus will put $600,000 into Slug Support&#8217;s emergency housing program and spend $25,000 to revamp the <a href="https://communityrentals.ucsc.edu">Community Rentals</a> web portal to increase the usefulness of the self-service resource. The site has proven to be a valuable resource with nearly 300,000 rental ads viewed last year and more than 14,000 rental ad inquiries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Affordable housing continues to be a major challenge in Santa Cruz and in other cities with UC campuses,&#8221; said Vice Provost for Student Success Jaye Padgett. "These funds will help many of our current and future UC Santa Cruz students.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will use $1 million to establish $1,500 housing allowances for first-year doctoral students and $1.25 million for transfer students to help them make the transition into the local housing market. The housing allowances are expected to help hundreds of transfer students.</p>
<p>This $3 million in funding became available recently as the result of a July 2017 decision by the UC Board of Regents to reallocate reserve funds from the Mortgage Origination Program (MOP) to put toward housing needs across nine campuses.</p>
<p>With the help of the Blum Center, the campus will spend $125,000 to conduct a study of low income student housing. The goal is to help inform campus practices, establish new resources, and improve housing outcomes for students.</p>
<p>Campus leaders reached out to the Student Union Assembly, Graduate Student Association, Staff Advisory Board, the Academic Senate, and other campus managers to generate ideas for how to use the $3 million and to evaluate the ideas.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="956a7dfe807270176c500acff17b7c96"><name>title-ix-investigator</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus hires third investigator for Title IX Office</title><summary>I am pleased to announce that UC Santa Cruz has hired Rosa Garcia to serve as an investigator in our Title IX Office.

<p>Garcia is a great addition to the office. She is dedicated to supporting our students, staff and faculty while ensuring a campus free of discrimination.</p>
<p>Our recruitment of a new Title IX Office director continues, with final candidates scheduled for campus visits in the coming weeks. My hope is that we make an offer in April. In the meantime, the office is under great leadership with Cherie Scricca, interim Title IX Officer.</p>

<p>All students in the program engage in a <a href="https://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/field-study/index.html">six-month field study</a>, joining a social justice organization to apply the critical theories they have previously learned during their interactions with more traditional elements of the college experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are in the field for six months actually putting what you&#8217;ve learned into practice, it makes it more tangible,&#8221; said Celia Contreras, a community studies student just recently back from her field study.</p>
<p>This type of hands-on experiential learning is a vital part of the program. Students first learn academic theories relating to community organization and social justice work, engage in their field study and then return to reflect on and analyze their experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s preparation, experience, and analysis,&#8221; said Mary Beth Pudup, Community Studies Program Director.</p>
<p>Contreras spent her field study stint with Pacoima Beautiful, an environmental justice organization located in the San Fernando Valley, which contains a portion of Los Angeles and several of its many satellite towns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It allowed me to see my hometown from a different perspective,&#8221; said Contreras who came to UC Santa Cruz from Pacoima, one of the oldest neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area that is heavily Hispanic. &#8220;I was there observing, experiencing seeing everything from the big picture of the organization&#8217;s mission to the smallest little details.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contreras will now present the fruits of her experience in a poster to be shown to her peers as part of Community Studies Poster Session, starting at 6 p.m., Thursday, Feb. 15 in the Oakes Academic Building.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a visual essay of sorts, without all the academic jargon,&#8221; Contreras said.</p>
<p>Pudup said the poster session is valuable academically, but also presents an opportunity for the students to proudly display the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It encourages reflection and analysis, but it also gets out the word about the tremendous work our students do,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>This year students are returning from a wide array of community organizations, both near and far.</p>
<p>One student got a shout out from President Barack Obama when he attended the first ever Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago representing his Oakland-based field study organization AYPAL, which advocates for low-income members of the Asian and Pacific Islander community in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>Another student travelled to Twin Falls, Idaho, where she spent her stint helping recent refugees gain literacy in the English language as part of the College of Southern Idaho Refugee Center.</p>
<p>Another student stayed closer to home working at the Pie Ranch, a working organic farm in Pescadero that also runs food education and farmer training programs. Jered Lawson, co-founder and co-director of Pie Ranch, is an alumnus of the Community Studies Program.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this program, the students come together, they burst apart to all these different places, and then they come back to campus to share their experiences,&#8221; Pudup said.</p>
<p>Jessica Chuidian-Ingersol worked with Tenants Together, a tenant organizing group that is working on the persistent housing crisis in the Bay Area, which afflicts Santa Cruz and university students as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming back after knocking on doors and meeting a lot of people passionate about the work they were doing I had about 200 pages of field notes,&#8221; Chuidian-Ingersol said. &#8220;At the time I didn&#8217;t connect what I was doing to theory but looking back on my experiences as part of theory has helped me to appreciate it more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The session not only helps students contextualize but provides an opportunity for them to see and comment on the work of their peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been really collaborative,&#8221; Chuidian-Ingersol said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a small cohort and we&#8217;ve been doing the same kind of work together, we&#8217;ve grown together, and I am really looking forward to seeing the posters and seeing how everyone spent their time.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9640f2ea807270176c500acf93a54563"><name>leauthaud-sloan-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC astronomer Alexie Leauthaud wins Sloan Research Fellowship</title><summary>The Sloan Research Fellowships honor early-career scholars whose achievements mark them as among the very best scientific minds working today. </summary><keywords>Alexie Leauthaud, dark matter</keywords><start-date>1518706800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC astronomer Alexie Leauthaud wins Sloan Research Fellowship</display-name><path>/2018/02/leauthaud-sloan-fellowship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/leauthaud-sloan-fellowship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1518644293325</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1518710650944</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</name><display-name>alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>119835</file-size><width>375</width><height>449</height></image><image-alt>Alexie Leauthaud</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20090</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alexie Leauthaud</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Alexie Leauthaud</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship to Alexie Leauthaud, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The prestigious two-year fellowship includes a grant of $65,000 to support Leauthaud's research, which focuses on understanding the connection between galaxies and dark matter. Awarded annually since 1955, the Sloan Research Fellowships honor early-career scholars whose achievements mark them as among the very best scientific minds working today.</p>
<p>Leauthaud's specialty is the phenomenon of "gravitational lensing," in which the gravity of a galaxy in the foreground of an image bends the light from a more distant galaxy as it passes by. Gravitational lensing can be used to measure the mass of the foreground galaxy, including the invisible mass of the galaxy's dark matter halo. This invisible and mysterious dark matter accounts for most of the mass in the universe and serves as the scaffolding upon which ordinary matter forms galaxies, stars, and planets.</p>
<p>Leauthaud's group plays a leading role in the "HSC Survey," an unprecedented effort to collect the most accurate data in the world to measure gravitational lensing using the Hyper Suprime Camera on the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii. She leads the galaxy formation working group and co-wrote the proposal that was awarded 300 nights of observing time on the Subaru Telescope to collect the data.</p>
<p>"I will use these data to characterize the link between galaxies and dark matter, to study dark energy and the theory of gravity, and to provide robust constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model in ways that were not previously possible," Leauthaud said.</p>
<p>Previous studies of dark matter revealed discrepancies between different data sets that may point to new physics, she said. New data from the HSC Survey and her expertise in gravitational lensing put Leauthaud in a unique position to address some of the most fundamental questions in physics as well as to understand the connections between galaxies and dark matter.</p>
<p>Leauthaud earned her M.S. at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris and her Ph.D. at the Laboratory of Astrophysics in Marseille, both in astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz in 2016, she was a researcher at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded in close coordination with the scientific community. Candidates must be nominated by their fellow scientists, and winners are selected by an independent panel of senior scholars in their field. The fellowships are awarded in chemistry, computer science, economics, mathematics, computational and evolutionary molecular biology, neuroscience, ocean sciences, and physics.</p>

<p>The campus was featured in a 2018 Top 10 list along with such institutions as the University of Southern California, New York University, Emerson College and UCLA.</p>
<p>The data used by College Factual for the rankings takes into account factors such as education quality, average earnings of graduates, accreditation, and graduation rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not be more pleased with this recognition,&#8221; said Susan Solt, dean of the Arts Division at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I am so very proud of our faculty and staff; it is wonderful recognition for our current students and shows the impact of our incredible alumni in the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, just this week, UC Santa Cruz alumnus Alex Johnston&#160;(Ph.D. Film &amp; Digital Media, 2017) will have a film screened at the 2018 Berlinale, one of the world&#8217;s leading international film festivals, running February 15-25 in Germany.</p>
<p>And UC Santa Cruz professor of film and digital media, Irene Lusztig, will also have a film at the Berlin festival--the world premiere of her new feature-length film,<span>&#160;</span><em><strong><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/lusztig-film-premiere.html">Yours in Sisterhood</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Irene was my primary creative advisor at UCSC, and has been a massive influence on my work as a filmmaker,&#8221; Johnston noted. &#8220;The film I am screening at the Berlinale constituted a &#8216;visual&#8217; chapter in my recently completed dissertation,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Evidence of the Evidence</em><em>, </em>Johnston&#8217;s film<span><em>&#160;</em></span>is about the 1971 Attica prison uprising. Utilizing rarely seen video recordings (produced by a New York State Trooper), it offers a visceral ground level account of the events at Attica.</p>
<p>Johnston&#8217;s work has screened at a wide range of venues, including the Cachoeira Doc Festival, San Francisco&#8217;s Other Cinema, the New Orleans Film Festival, Iowa City Documentary Film Festival, and the Miners' Colfax Medical Center, a convalescent home for retired hard rock and coal miners in Raton, New Mexico.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/lusztig-film-premiere.html</url><title>Arts professor to premiere film at 2018 Berlin International Film Festival</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a112c85c807270176c500acf1c8514d3"><name>olli-hoops</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alley-oops for the OLLI Hoops </title><summary>For this basketball team made up of women in their 60s and 70s, getting exercise, enjoying camaraderie, and learning a new skill has been a slam dunk.&#13;

(Photos by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>For this basketball team made up of women in their 60s and 70s, getting exercise, enjoying camaraderie, and learning a new skill has been a slam dunk</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunlight filters through the high windows of the old gym, and, for a moment, it&#8217;s possible to forget the grey hair and the age-spotted skin of the nine women on the basketball court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their shoes squeak against the hardwood floor as they maneuver for shots. Arms block, bodies bump, and when a ball drops through the net with a whispered swoosh, everyone cheers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the OLLI Hoops, a group of women in their 60s and 70s who met through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at UCSC (OLLI), and have taken to the basketball court as a way to get exercise, enjoy the camaraderie of other energetic women, and, for many, learn a new skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of them (the women) weren&#8217;t even encouraged to do any sports&#8221; when they were young, says Mathilde Rand, a retired elementary school principal and former PE teacher who serves as the team&#8217;s unofficial coach. &#8220;But now, they&#8217;ve decided this is the right time. Time is up. We can do anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group began last October when Mary Caravalho, 68, a retired educator whose two sons played basketball, saw a YouTube video about a group of 80- and 90-year-old women in San Diego&#8217;s senior women&#8217;s basketball league.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caravalho, who spent the majority of her high school years in St. Louis, Mo., and Mobile, Al., &#8220;where girls weren&#8217;t supposed to perspire,&#8221; was intrigued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of 700 members of the UC Santa Cruz Osher lifelong learners group, she posted a notice saying she wanted to start a senior women&#8217;s basketball team. Besides meetings and lectures, OLLI has about 50 peer-led interest groups that focus on literature, history, science, film, current events, hiking, and nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eleven women signed up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This gives me a lot of joy,&#8221; says Lillian Miranda, 72, as she took a break between drills on a recent Monday. The retired Massachusetts juvenile court judge says she likes being part of a team and meeting new friends. But basketball also feeds her lifetime hunger for learning new skills, she says. It&#8217;s a passion shared by many on the team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The women talk of playing recreational sports like soccer or basketball in junior high or high school but none competed on a high school or college team. Most grew up during the time before Title IX, part of the Education Amendments of 1972, which required that any educational program that received federal money could not discriminate on the basis of sex. A study published in 2008 in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sport Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that athletic participation by girls in high school increased from 295,000 in 1971 to 2.8 million in 2003&#8211;2004&#8212;a jump of more than 840 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is fulfilling a youthful wanting,&#8221; says Caravalho, who described herself as a tomboy who liked to play softball and army games as a kid. One of five children, Caravalho remembers her father telling her at the age of 13: &#8220;Mary, I have three sons, I don&#8217;t need another.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Luckily, that didn&#8217;t really crush me,&#8221; says Caravalho, who adds this team &#8220;has really changed my thinking about what I can do and what I want to do.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That kind of gutsy resourcefulness seems to be a characteristic of the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needing a place to practice besides a cracked outdoor court, the team found a gym that charged $25 for a one-hour session and divides the cost among its 11 members. As for uniforms, the group located reversible purple and white jerseys&#8212;perfect for intra-squad matches&#8212;for $9 each. One of their members leads warm-ups, another wrote a team song to the tune of The Hollywood Argyles&#8217; 1963 hit &#8220;Alley Oop,&#8221; and they all came up with the group&#8217;s pun-tastic name and its team cheer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The first time we did it (the cheer), we cracked ourselves up,&#8221; says one team member, causing other members of the squad to laugh with the memory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the group also have bonded with the UC Santa Cruz women&#8217;s basketball team. The OLLI Hoops team got to join a practice with the Slug squad, and its members have have become regular attendees at the UC Santa Cruz team&#8217;s home games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todd Kent, coach for the successful UC Santa Cruz women&#8217;s basketball team, says his players love looking up in the stands and seeing the older players, adding he has plans to work with the squad in the future.</span></p>

Some groups represent existing collaborations that aim to expand their reach and scope, while others are imaginative new initiatives catalyzed by the SAP process. In all cases, the groups exemplify the array of path-breaking research (from basic to artistic) of which our campus is capable.&#160; But given the extensive number of proposed areas, we will need to do the difficult work of prioritizing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wY2flOR3BbWLsJA-3QAGlWhx9qfghyuNQFr61N5ITeA/edit#https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wY2flOR3BbWLsJA-3QAGlWhx9qfghyuNQFr61N5ITeA/edit">list</a>.<br/><br/>To be strategic in our time and resource commitments over the next five years, we will select up to three areas for initial development, with the understanding that our academic planning must be ongoing, and that the campus will continue to identify additional areas for development in the years to come. It is important to emphasize that we will continue to support programs across the university, even though they may not be designated strategic growth areas in this academic plan. Our commitment to remaining a comprehensive liberal arts and sciences university remains firm. &#160;<br/><br/>To start the survey, click on <a href="https://ucsantacruzfebruary.questionpro.com#https://ucsantacruzfebruary.questionpro.com/">this link</a>.<br/><br/>The survey is anonymous, and your participation is voluntary. It should take approximately 10 minutes to complete. You may skip any question you prefer not to answer. The survey will close at 5 p.m. Wednesday, March 7.<br/><br/>If you have questions about the survey, please email us at <a href="mailto:academicplan@ucsc.edu">academicplan@ucsc.edu</a>.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time and assistance.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Campus Community</audience><admin>Martin Berger, Associate Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b4c8a356807270176c500acf1903bc4d"><name>sv-link</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz tech incubator offers convenient access to Silicon Valley</title><summary>A new program from the University of California, Santa Cruz, offers campus and other UC entrepreneurs the opportunity to launch their startup companies from its Silicon Valley Campus. </summary><start-date>1519113600000</start-date><display-name>SVLink</display-name><path>/2018/02/sv-link</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/sv-link</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1519156502202</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1519156651721</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/svlink-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/svlink-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>svlink-500px.jpg</name><display-name>svlink-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>162422</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>SVLink offices in Silicon Valley</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/sv-link-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/sv-link-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sv-link-80px.jpg</name><display-name>sv-link-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14389</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>SVLink offices in Silicon Valley </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Startups accepted into SV-Link will get access to office space, conference rooms, as well as business training for one year.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A new program from the University of California, Santa Cruz, offers campus and other UC entrepreneurs the opportunity to launch their startup companies from its Silicon Valley Campus.</p>
<p><a href="https://svlink.ucsc.edu/index.html">SVLink</a>, managed by the Office of Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization (IATC), will offer support for up to 27 companies at 3175 Bowers Ave., Santa Clara. IATC is accepting online applications, which will be reviewed on a monthly basis, starting on March 15, 2018. Priority will be given to companies connected to UC Santa Cruz and to the rest of the University of California, though anyone is welcome to apply. Applications will continue to be accepted until all the slots are filled.</p>
<p>&#8220;SVLink provides UC faculty, staff, students, and alumni the opportunity to launch their startup company in the heart of the Silicon Valley,&#8221; Assistant Vice Chancellor Mohamed Abousalem said. &#8220;Helping innovative research ideas and technologies created at the University of California reach the public is part of our mission as a public university.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program was partially funded with the $2.2 million UC Santa Cruz received from California Assembly Bill (AB) 2664, which provided one-time funding to further innovation and entrepreneurship efforts at the University of California and the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Applications will be reviewed by a committee comprised of UC Santa Cruz staff and faculty members.</p>
<p>Michael John, program director for <a href="https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu/">Games and Playable Media</a>, said the program is an exciting new resource for computational media graduate students located both in Santa Cruz and in the Silicon Valley campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of our students graduate with entrepreneurial ambitions, but few resources to help them get off the ground. The combination of location, mentoring and connection to the local Silicon Valley community is a big leg up for these graduates,&#8221; John said. &#8220;Additionally, as the population of students studying in the Silicon Valley campus continues to grow, the opportunity to connect with entrepreneurial graduates across technology industries will provide valuable connections between alumni and students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startups accepted into SV-Link will get access to office space, conference rooms, as well as business training for one year. The startups, which must be registered as a C-corporation, will need to sign a three-year promissory note for the rent of the office space. Those with ties to UC Santa Cruz are eligible for a $10,000 loan to fully cover the business training. Entrepreneurs affiliated with UC are eligible for a $3,000 loan and UC entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups are eligible for a $5,000 loan.</p>
<p>The business coaching includes monthly one-on-one mentor sessions about business development; monthly one-on-one mentoring sessions with investors, experts, and company founders; a monthly speaker series featuring investors, startup founders, and corporate executives; and much more.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz opened its new Silicon Valley Campus in 2016. The campus is home to professional masters programs, Silicon Valley-facing research, Silicon Valley Extension, and now SVLink. The 90,000-square-foot academic building supports UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s ambitious growth plans for the region, including developing a stronger connection and greater interaction between faculty, students, and Silicon Valley industry.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Theater Arts Department and the African American Theatre Arts Troupe at UC Santa Cruz will present Lorraine Hansberry&#8217;s groundbreaking play, <strong><em>A Raisin in the Sun</em></strong><em>,</em> on campus, March 2-11, at the Theater Arts Second Stage.</p>
<p>Premiering in 1959, <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> was the first play written by an African American woman produced on Broadway and a winner of the New York Critics' Play of the Year award. It was later made into a feature film starring Sidney Poitier, who recreated his stage performance in the leading role.<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The play portrays the intense hostility faced by a black family when they attempt to move into an exclusive white neighborhood. It takes its title from the 1951 Langston Hughes poem, <em>Harlem</em>, which asks: &#8220;What happens to a dream deferred? / Does it dry up / like a raisin in the sun? / Or does it explode?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>The widespread popularity of <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> transformed the face of American theater, spawning more than 600 new African American theater companies from the mid 1960&#8217;s to mid 1970s. As writer James Baldwin famously noted, the play &#8220;put more of the truth of black people&#8217;s lives on the stage than any other play in the entire history of theatre.&#8221;&#160; </span></p>
<p><span></span><strong>The UC Santa Cruz production</strong> is directed by lecturer Don Williams and will feature drama students from the African American Theatre Arts Troupe, an ensemble he founded on campus in 1991.</p>
<p>The cast also includes a very special guest--award-winning actress and distinguished UC Santa Cruz alumna--Adilah Barnes (Cowell &#8217;72).</p>
<p>Barnes is a stage, film and television actor whose career has spanned more than four decades. She is perhaps best known to television audiences for her role on ABC's <em>Roseanne</em> and has recently appeared on ABC's <em>The Middle,</em> NBC&#8217;s <em>Harry&#8217;s Law</em> and <em>Prime Suspect,</em> and CBS's <em>Cold Case. </em>Barnes will also appear in the upcoming 2018 revival of the <em>Roseanne</em> sit-com after a 20-year hiatus.</p>
<p>Her film credits include <em>Erin Brockovich</em> with Julia Roberts, and <em>Murder by Numbers. </em></p>
<p><em></em>Barnes has also toured 40 states and three continents with her one-woman play, <em>I Am That I Am: Woman, Black.</em> And in 2017, she was honored, along with the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival, which she co-founded, at the Inner City Cultural Center's 50th anniversary in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>"Being a cast member of UC Santa Cruz's production of <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> is heartwarming for me on many levels,&#8221; Barnes noted. &#8221;First of all, the play is one of my all-time favorite timeless classics. I adore Lorraine Hansberry, who I also portray and give homage to in my solo show <em>On My Own Terms:&#160;One Actor's Journey</em>.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, returning to UCSC and leading a cast of students is a learning experience for all of us, not to mention working with director Don Williams, whom I have worked with in different capacities for many years. And thirdly, I portrayed the daughter character of 'Beneatha' (in <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>) many years ago and welcome growing into playing the wise and powerful role of 'Mama' at this time around in my career.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply humbled by this UCSC opportunity to work on stage again," Barnes added.</p>
<p><strong>The African American Theater Arts Troupe</strong> is a student-based organization that was formed by Williams as a vehicle to create higher visibility, and understanding of African American culture at UC Santa Cruz and in the greater Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>The Troupe welcomes students from different educational backgrounds and also casts students with little or no experience with acting, technical, and administrative work, in an effort to allow anyone the opportunity to get involved with the program.</p>
<p>Williams said that Lorraine Hansberry&#8217;s<em> A Raisin in the Sun &#8220;</em>brings out the spirit of hope. Because no matter how bad things may become, one can still press forward. If you&#8217;re down and out, there is a step forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz dean of the arts Susan Solt noted that it is an honor for the Arts Division to present <em>A Raisin the the Sun</em>, describing the play as &#8220;a treasure of the American theater and one of the greatest works in the modern canon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What better way to celebrate the UC Santa Cruz Year of Alumni than having one of our most successful and beloved alums, Adilah Barnes, back with us to teach our students, share her mastery of her craft, and to challenge and inspire us to think about issues of race, class, and culture,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Those eye-popping findings, published in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/140246/abstract"><em>Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment</em></a>, delighted the "local food" movement. For Campbell, they underscore the importance of testing the viability of environmental initiatives that have captured the popular imagination.</p>
<p>"I take these dreamy ideas and see if the numbers play out," said Campbell, an associate professor of environmental studies and the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/campbell-investiture.html">inaugural recipient</a> of the Stephen R. Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food System Sustainability. "That study was exciting, because it showed how much potential there is. Right now only about 1 percent of food is produced within the 'local food' parameters."</p>
<p>Campbell, who joined the faculty in July, is an environmental engineer who is drawn to research at the nexus of food, water, and energy. The Central Coast is a perfect "laboratory," because he is particularly intrigued by opportunities that pop up when urban and agricultural areas are in close proximity.</p>
<p>Building on the "local food" work, Campbell is eager to explore whether reclaimed wastewater generated by cities could be used to recharge aquifers that have been depleted by agriculture. "The Central Coast is unparalleled when it comes to using reclaimed water for edible crops," said Campbell. "We need to reuse water, and we need to recirculate water."</p>
<p>Similarly, Campbell is interested in recirculating nutrients between cities and farms&#8212;specifically nutrients that are lost when food turns to waste.</p>
<p>"Forty percent of food goes to waste," said Campbell. "When we divert waste from the landfill as compost, ideally we send it back to farms. But compost is a bulky, low-value product; it doesn't make sense to transport it long distances. It needs to be generated near cities for use on nearby farms."</p>
<p>Campbell refers to the wastewater and nutrient recycling ideas as "circular systems," both of which are in keeping with the principles of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). Professor Emeritus Steve Gliessman, a founder of the field of agroecology, was "in the field," whereas Campbell refers to himself as a researcher who does "large-scale modeling."</p>
<p>"I bring something different to the campus, but I get a lot of my ideas from farmers," he said.</p>
<p>Campbell looks forward to collaborating with professors Carol Shennan and Daniel Press of Environmental Studies, as well as Andy Fisher, professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences and a widely recognized expert on aquifer recharge.</p>
<p>A native of Santa Cruz, Campbell joined the faculty from UC Merced, drawn to the Environmental Studies Department's interdisciplinary approach.</p>
<p>"Everybody is talking about interdisciplinary science, but this department is really doing it," he said. "It's easy to talk about it. The reality is that it's sometimes painful and unpleasant. But it's necessary, because it's at the intersection of disciplines where you have breakthrough moments."</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz collaboration among Environmental Studies Professor Michael Loik and physicists Sue Carter and Glenn Alers on the viability of <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/loik-greenhouse.html">solar greenhouses</a> has caught Campbell's attention, as well. Greenhouses are energy intensive, but they can significantly boost a region's ability to produce "local food" by extending production through the "shoulder seasons" of spring and fall. What's the "sweet spot" between production and energy consumption, and how might solar power-generating greenhouses impact that calculation, asks Campbell.</p>
<p>"These phenomena are growing rapidly, and this is a critical time for scientists to get engaged, before things get set in stone," he said, noting that year-round food production provides the added social benefit of job security for workers.</p>
<p>Campbell's reach extends far beyond Santa Cruz County, however. He recently approached the California State Water Resources Control Board about a proposal to analyze the potential benefits of covering the state's aqueducts and irrigation canals to reduce evaporation, and installing solar panels to generate electricity.</p>
<p>"People have been talking about this for ages, but there's no good science behind it," said Campbell, noting that impacts on waterfowl and other creatures also need to be examined. These are the large, complex, interdisciplinary&#8212;and interwoven&#8212;questions that intrigue Campbell.</p>
<p>"We need to do some experiments to figure out the scale of this resource," he said.</p>
<p>Campbell's solution-oriented work attracts the attention of scientists, policy makers, journalists, and others who are looking for new ways to boost environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Asked about the warm public reception of ideas that have not been demonstrated to be environmentally sustainable, Campbell says he thinks he understands it. "In the case of local food, we have a long history of doing it," he said. "It's not the dominant model now, but it's almost like instinct to say 'We can do this.' If food and people are too far apart, they will never come back together. But if they are close enough, we'll get these opportunities. We are moving toward circular systems."</p>

Primordial black holes are a potential source of gamma rays, the highest-energy form of light. (Illustration credit: NASA)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Some theories of the early universe predict density fluctuations that would have created small "primordial black holes," some of which could be drifting through our galactic neighborhood today and might even be bright sources of gamma rays.</p>
<p>Researchers analyzing data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for evidence of nearby primordial black holes have come up empty, but their negative findings still allow them to put an upper limit on the number of these tiny black holes that might be lurking in the vicinity of Earth.</p>
<p>"Understanding how many primordial black holes are around today can help us understand the early universe better," said Christian Johnson, a graduate student in physics at UC Santa Cruz who developed an algorithm to search data from Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT) for the signatures of primordial black holes. Johnson is a corresponding author of a paper on the findings that has been accepted for publication in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> and is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00100">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Low-mass black holes are expected to emit gamma rays due to Hawking radiation, a theoretical prediction from the work of physicist Stephen Hawking and others. Hawking showed that quantum effects can give rise to particle-antiparticle pairs near the event horizon of a black hole, allowing one of the particles to fall into the black hole and the other to escape. The result is that the black hole emits radiation and loses mass.</p>
<p>A small black hole that isn't absorbing enough from its environment to offset the losses from Hawking radiation will steadily lose mass and eventually evaporate entirely. The smaller it gets, the brighter it "burns," emitting more and more Hawking radiation before exploding in a final cataclysm. Previous searches for primordial black holes using ground-based gamma-ray observatories have looked for these brief explosions, but Fermi should be able to detect the "burn phase" occurring over a period of several years.</p>
<p>A limitation of the Fermi search was that it could only extend a relatively short distance from Earth (a small fraction of the distance to the nearest star). The advantage of looking nearby, however, is that primordial black holes could be distinguished from other sources of gamma rays by their movement on the sky.</p>
<p>"It's like looking at the sky at night and trying to decide if something is an airplane or a star," Johnson explained. "If it's an airplane, it will move, and if it's a star it will stay put."</p>
<p>Any primordial black holes still around today would have started out much larger and have been gradually losing mass for billions of years. To detect one with Fermi, it would have to have reached the final burn phase during the roughly four-year observation period of the study. Over a period of a few years, it would go from undetectably dim to extremely bright, and would burn brightly for several years before exploding, Johnson said.</p>
<p>"Even though we didn't detect any, the non-detection sets a limit on the rate of explosions and gives us better constraints than previous research," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Johnson, the other corresponding authors of the paper include Steven Ritz, professor of physics and director of the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics at UCSC; and Stefan Funk and Dmitry Malyshev at the Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics in Germany. Other members of the Fermi-LAT Collaboration also contributed to this work and are coauthors of the paper.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://youtu.be/WlWhGN2hTN8</url><title>Christian Johnson Grad Slam Presentation</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b9da4bbb807270176c500acfe2ef7f04"><name>marine-animals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Tracking data reveal the secret lives of marine animals </title><summary>Seals, whales, sharks, turtles, seabirds, and other marine vertebrates show similar patterns of movement in marine environments.</summary><keywords>Daniel Costa</keywords><start-date>1519675200000</start-date><display-name>Tracking data reveal the secret lives of marine animals </display-name><path>/2018/02/marine-animals</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/marine-animals</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1519241545384</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1519675717105</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/crabeater-seal-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/crabeater-seal-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>crabeater-seal-400.jpg</name><display-name>crabeater-seal-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>86039</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>crabeater seal</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/crabeater-seal-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/crabeater-seal-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>crabeater-seal-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>crabeater-seal-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19087</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>crabeater seal</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Researchers have followed the movements of a wide array of marine animals using satellite tracking tags, including crabeater seals in Antarctica (above) and (below, top to bottom): California sea lion, black-footed albatross, manatee, Galapagos sea lion, and elephant seal.

Insights gained from this technology have revealed unexpected behaviors and migratory patterns in marine animals ranging from sharks and seals to turtles and albatrosses.</p>
<p>Researchers from around the world have now pooled their data on the movements of a wide array of marine animals, enabling them to look for common features in how animals move throughout the world's oceans. The results, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/02/16/1716137115">published February 26 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, show remarkable convergence in the movement patterns of different species, even those widely separated by geography, phylogeny (evolutionary history), or mode of travel.</p>
<p>The biggest differences were between different habitats rather than between different species. In coastal areas, tracking tags revealed complex movement patterns dominated by search behavior, while in the open ocean they showed simpler, more predictable movements over longer distances.</p>
<p>"It makes sense, because the coast is a much more complicated environment, whereas the open ocean is more homogeneous and the features are more spread out in space and time," said coauthor Daniel Costa, a distinguished professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. "Regardless of what species it is, the movement patterns match the oceanographic features of their environment."</p>
<p>These insights can be useful, he said, for understanding how marine life will respond to climate change and for predicting the movements of species for which tracking data are lacking. "Many of these species are endangered and we have no tracking data, but we can extrapolate from other species to understand how they are likely to interact with fisheries, shipping, or other human activities," Costa said.</p>
<p><strong>High-tech devices</strong></p>
<p>Costa has been at the forefront of developing high-tech tracking devices and using them to study marine animals. UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory is known as a leading center for research on marine vertebrates, including seals, sea lions, sea otters, dolphins, and whales. The coauthors of the <em>PNAS</em> paper include six other UC Santa Cruz researchers in addition to Costa.</p>
<p>"This paper is the result of a big international effort. We realized that if we all share our data and work together in a concerted manner, we can learn a lot more about these animals," he said.</p>
<p>Costa and other UCSC researchers deployed the first satellite tracking tags on elephant seals at the A&#241;o Nuevo rookery north of Santa Cruz in the 1990s. The initial results were astonishing.</p>
<p>"Before we put tags on elephant seals, all the books said they were limited to the California Current. We had no idea they were traveling these incredible distances and using the entire North Pacific Ocean," Costa said. "We went from studying them where we could watch them to having the animals tell us where they were going."</p>
<p><strong>TOPP program</strong></p>
<p>In 2000, Costa joined forces with Barbara Block at Stanford University and others to launch the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/costa-topp.html">Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) program</a>, a decade-long effort to track the movements of top marine predators in the Pacific Ocean. Costa oversaw the tracking of marine mammals, birds, and turtles for TOPP, which also included tracking of sharks and tunas.</p>
<p>Costa's lab has carried out groundbreaking tracking studies of a wide range of species around the world, including albatrosses, sooty shearwaters, California sea lions, Galapagos sea lions, crabeater seals, Weddell seals, and southern elephant seals. Meanwhile, his team has continued to learn new things about elephant seal biology from ongoing studies of the northern elephant seals at UC's A&#241;o Nuevo Natural Reserve.</p>
<p>One recent study, <a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/14/2/20170722">published February 14 in <em>Biology Letters</em></a>, revealed the effects of pregnancy on the diving behavior of female elephant seals. Led by postdoctoral researcher Luis Huckstadt, the researchers found that the dives of pregnant seals became shorter, probably due to an increasing demand for oxygen for the fetus.</p>
<p>"The only way we could do that is because we now have over 500 tracks of female elephant seals, and a small number of them didn't have a pup or lost it at sea, so we could compare and see the effects of pregnancy. It's not surprising, but nobody had been able to document it," Costa said.</p>

<p>To date, 15 undergraduates have participated in the program, which provides independent research opportunities, as well as summer housing, faculty mentors, full-time work during the summer, and part-time work during four academic quarters.</p>
<p>Students work closely with faculty mentors on research projects in topics related to agroecology and food systems, including sustainable agriculture, ecosystem services, and food justice. Students in the program, which emphasizes interdisciplinary solutions, have investigated topics that range from plant physiology to food justice.</p>
<p>"This program gives students professional development and research skills at the same time," said Stacy Philpott, professor of Environmental Studies and the coordinator of the program, known as Supporting Undergraduates by Promoting Education, Research, Diversity, and Agricultural Resilience (SUPERDAR). "We learned from the first cohort that it also provides underrepresented students with a greater sense of belonging on campus, which is another welcome benefit of the program."</p>
<p>The program begins in the spring when participating students, known as fellows, meet their faculty mentor, develop their research proposal, and prepare for full-time research over the summer. Fellows receive stipends for eight hours per week during the school year, and 40 hours per week for eight weeks over the summer. Free on-campus summer housing is also provided as part of the program.</p>
<p><em>Growing healthy soil</em></p>
<p>For Emily Miethke, who transferred to UC Santa Cruz from MiraCosta College in San Diego County, the SUPERDAR program offers just the kind of hands-on research experience she was hoping to get at a public research university. Summer housing and paid work experience were essential to her ability to participate.</p>
<p>"I wanted a job, and I wanted to see what I could do, so I applied," said Miethke, who is working on a soil-pathogen project with Environmental Studies Professor Carol Shennan and research scientist Joji Muramoto.</p>
<p>Shennan and Muramoto pioneered a novel strategy called anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) to fight soil pathogens that can devastate strawberry fields. Many farmers have welcomed this alternative to fungicides, but the cost of rice bran&#8212;a key ingredient&#8212;is soaring, prompting Shennan to look for alternatives. Which is where Miethke comes into the story.</p>
<p>Miethke has run two experiments with 85 plants to test the effectiveness of six alternatives to rice bran. Replication is important in agricultural research, because there are so many variables. "The first round was attacked by birds that poked holes in the plastic, and we got a lot of salt damage," she said. "We weren't seeing the effects of the disease, just a lot of stressed out plants." Now, with the second round, the plants are healthier, allowing Miethke to track the prevalence of disease and compare the impacts of the different alternatives to rice bran. "That's what research is: seeing what doesn't work, moving on, and learning from it," she said.</p>
<p>Miethke, a full-time student who works in Shennan's soils lab on campus in addition to the SUPERDAR fellowship, looks forward to the possibility of publishing her results as part of a paper with Shennan and Muramoto. An environmental studies major with an agroecology focus, she has learned a lot about the impact of agriculture on the environment, which made the ASD project a good fit. "I'm interested in alternatives to monoculture farming and helping to find biological alternatives to the pesticide- and fungicide-ridden systems we have now," she said.</p>
<p>"It's been a huge growing experience for me," she said of the fellowship. "I've learned so much. I've gained professional skills, and I'm not afraid to ask questions, to reach out to established scientists, to speak up when I don't understand. I've found ways to fend for myself and be confident."</p>
<p><em>Food justice in a school-based community garden</em></p>
<p>For senior Michelle Hernandez, who is majoring in cognitive science, the SUPERDAR program gave her a chance to focus on food justice. She and another SUPERDAR fellow are exploring the function and value of a community garden located at Calabasas Elementary School in Watsonville. By exploring parents' relationship to the garden, Hernandez is hoping to illuminate long-term strategies to give them an opportunity to grow their own healthy food.</p>
<p>"This research is based on ethnographic observation, being present, and building community," said Hernandez. Once she gets to know parents, most of whom are farmworkers, she conducts open-ended interviews, often in Spanish, then transcribes and translates the conversations. She is in the process of coding and analyzing the results.</p>
<p>"It's beautiful, because there's a big stigma to working in the fields, but the garden is different," she said. "I hear how they connect with the land and are enjoying what they do. They tell me, 'Working is one thing, but growing my own food is different.' "</p>
<p>SUPERDAR gave Hernandez her first opportunity to work closely with a faculty member, and she feels lucky to have the mentorship of Environmental Studies Professor Flora Lu, who is provost of Colleges Nine and Ten, as well as Linnea Beckett, who coordinates the Food Justice Program for Colleges Nine and Ten. "They are both amazing women," said Hernandez. "They have really taught me about who I am and how the world works."</p>
<p>Hernandez is "doing graduate work as an undergraduate," said Beckett. "She is reading the literature on school and community gardens, Latino parent engagement, settler colonialism, and land education," she said. "It's a really intersectional project."</p>
<p>"Michelle is an incredible representative of UCSC to the farmworker families," added Lu. "She demonstrates genuine concern, compassion, and connection with the families. Through her study of decolonization, feminist critical theory, race, and class, she has acquired the language to describe the challenges they face, as well as her own experience as a Latina, first-generation, student of color."</p>
<p>Hernandez is helping organize "Dig In: Cultivating Inclusive Approaches to Food Justice," a daylong conference sponsored by Colleges Nine and Ten in collaboration with many campus and community partners. She will make a presentation about her work during the event. "Research takes a long time," she said. "You can't do it in a few months. It's the only way you can feel involved. I like it. I really like it."</p>
<p>And she feels like she belongs. "I wish I had been part of this project during my first year," she said. "It's so fulfilling."</p>
<p><em>USDA's Experiential Learning Initiative Program</em></p>
<p>SUPERDAR is part of the USDA's Experiential Learning Initiative Program, which provided about $275,000 for the three-year program. Student interest is strong, and seven faculty mentors have participated to date, their expertise spanning subjects that include plant physiology, climate change, biodiversity, pest control, soils, and food security. Many students conduct research on campus, either at the Alan Chadwick Garden or the UC Santa Cruz Farm.</p>
<p>"It's a wonderful program that gives students a chance to take a deep dive," said Philpott. "It's extraordinary for an undergraduate to spend 15 months on research. There are very few programs like this, especially in the field of agroecology."</p>
<p>The program opens up job opportunities for graduates and gives students a leg up when they apply to graduate school, because it shows their ability to carry out an extended, in-depth research project, which is attractive to prospective graduate mentors, added Philpott.</p>
<p>Because Philpott has been a frugal administrator, the program will continue this summer with five more fellows. "We're stretching the funding to give more students the opportunity," she said.</p>

<p>The 16th Annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture will begin at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 23 at the Colleges Nine/Ten Multi-purpose Room. Admission is free, <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/maitra/">with registration</a>. The university will host a post-lecture reception to provide an opportunity for the audience to engage with Rao.</p>
<p>The Maitra lecture series, established in 2001, seeks to enrich the intellectual life of UC Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz community. The program was established and endowed by Anuradha Luther Maitra, Ph.D., who taught economics here in the 1980s and was called back to service at the university in 2000 as trustee on the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board and in 2013 as special adviser to the chancellor for international initiatives.</p>
<p>As Maitra explains it, the genesis of the lecture series was a shattering grief, an attempt to keep alive the memory of her late husband, Sidhartha Maitra, a distinguished scientist and visionary entrepreneur who died in a plane crash in 2000. The inaugural speaker was author Vikram Seth, a close friend of the Maitras, who spoke of &#8220;Friendship and Poetry&#8221; and recited verse in English, Chinese, and Urdu, sprinkling in vignettes of his friendship with Sid.</p>
<p>Over the years, the series has evolved into a signature university event, with lectures that have addressed a wide range of topics from global warming to the cosmos, nuclear weapons and terrorism to creativity in the arts and humanities in the time of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>&#8220;On surface there seems to be no connection between the subjects,&#8221; Maitra said. &#8220;But all the speakers are linked by their commitment to a broadly humanist, rationalist, modernist tradition that Sid and I both subscribed to. They have all been gems, each with its own color, faceting, and sparkle but held together by the common thread of universalism. There is no need for a mission statement&#8212;the necklace speaks for itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2006, Nobel Prize Laureate and Harvard Professor Amartya Sen, who taught Maitra when she was a graduate student in Delhi, delivered a powerful message about &#8220;The Tyranny of Identity,&#8221; making the point that if we all recognize and amplify the multiple identities we have in today&#8217;s modern world, the chances of finding something in common with one another get wondrously multiplied.</p>
<p>Five years after that, Abraham Verghese of Stanford University&#8217;s School of Medicine spoke about &#8220;The Art of Medicine in the Era of Homo Technologicus,&#8221; advocating for a renewed humanism in today&#8217;s healthcare system, one that all too often focuses on the e-patient rather than the person. A year later, UC Santa Cruz astrophysicist Sandra Faber dazzled the audience with a multimedia presentation on &#8220;Modern Genesis and the Limits of Cosmic Knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s speaker, Ambassador Rao, not only has a distinguished career as a diplomat, but she is a musician and poet with a love of literature and history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nirupama comes from a different intellectual tradition than Sid; she belongs to the humanities,&#8221; Maitra said. &#8220;But she arrives at the same conclusion of the way our world should work&#8212;respectful of our common humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like almost all the speakers in this series, Rao has a long prior connection to Maitra. Rao&#8217;s husband, Sudhakar Rao, was Maitra&#8217;s classmate at the Delhi School of Economics. Maitra is now married to Professor Thomas Kailath of Stanford University, and Rao also delivered the 2014 Sarah Kailath Memorial Lecture, &#8220;Women Who Lead: Pages From an Indian Story,&#8221; as part of a series endowed at UC Berkeley by Kailath in honor of his late wife.</p>

But now a study co-authored by professors from MIT, UC Santa Cruz, and Northwestern University reveals its painful financial impact as well: On aggregate, hospitalization and the health problems that cause it lead to a 20 percent drop in earnings and an 11 percent drop in employment for adults between ages 50 and 59, among other negative effects.</p>
<p>Moreover, job troubles are merely one of the financial costs that follow hospital stays. As the study shows, adults who have health problems leading to hospitalization have worse subsequent access to credit &#8212; as well as larger unpaid medical bills and more out-of-pocket medical spending.</p>
<p>And while medical insurance does temper some of these outcomes, the long-term financial hurt of a medical event serious enough to cause hospitalization is significant even for the insured.</p>
<p>"The sobering truth is that even people who have health insurance don&#8217;t have anywhere close to full insurance," says Amy Finkelstein, an economist at MIT who helped lead the study. "Not [only] for the reasons that we&#8217;re used to thinking about, [such as] cost-sharing and high deductibles, but because health insurance doesn&#8217;t insure the economic consequences of poor health."</p>
<p>The paper, "The Economic Consequences of Hospital Admissions," has just been published in the latest issue of the&#160;<em>American Economic Review</em>. The co-authors are Finkelstein, who is the John and Jennie S. MacDonald Professor of Economics at MIT; Carlos Dobkin, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Raymond Kluender, a PhD student in economics at MIT; and Matthew Notowidigdo, an associate professor of economics at Northwestern University.</p>
<p><strong>This could hurt</strong></p>
<p>The bulk of the data in the study comes from the state of California, including hospitalization records from the years 2003&#8211;2007 and credit reports from 2002&#8211;2011, for people ages 25 and up. The researchers examined records for roughly 780,000 people with health insurance and about 150,000 people without health insurance. The data was available under restricted conditions to preserve the anonymity of the people being studied.</p>
<p>Some of the data, which focused on job outcomes, also came from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a biannual U.S. national survey, and covered the years 1992&#8211;2012 for nearly 10,000 people.</p>
<p>While other studies have relied on self-reported survey data to infer the financial fallout that follows poor health, the research team in this case could more robustly establish and quantify the cause-and-effect relationship between the onset of serious medical problems and their ensuing financial implications. By examining the California medical and credit records in tandem, along with the HRS data, they established how the hospitalization episodes altered individuals&#8217; economic trajectories.</p>
<p>"What&#8217;s really unique about the paper is the data," Notowidigdo says.</p>
<p>The average hospital admission in the study lasted four days. While the length and long-term effects of any one medical event can vary widely, the aggregate effects were striking. Consider the employment numbers: Having medical problems that require a hospital stay reduces employment by 8.9 percentage points in the first subsequent year, on average, and 11.1 percentage points by the third year after admission.</p>
<p>That corresponds with an average decrease in earnings of $6,445 in the first year after a hospital admission, and $11,071 in the third year. Over the whole three-year span, earnings drop an average of $8,753 annually, a decline of 20 percent.</p>
<p>Three years after their hospitalizations, employees also face a decrease in annual time worked by 228 hours, and self-reported retirement increases by 10 percentage points. All the employment numbers are striking, the researchers say.</p>
<p>"The magnitudes are pretty similar to what labor economists have studied when they look at people who are laid off in what&#8217;s called a 'mass layoff event,' if a manufacturing plant closes down and a lot of people lose their jobs," Notowidigdo says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after people are hospitalized, their long-term access to credit declines and their debt levels worsen. Four years after a hospital admission, the average credit limit of individuals declines by $2,215 on average, or about 5.5 percent, and people&#8217;s total collection balances &#8212; the amount owed &#8212; increase by $302, on average.</p>
<p>A significant part of this pocketbook crunch is generated by medical expenses. Average annual out-of-pocket medical spending increases by $1,429 in the three years after an admission, showing that serious health events lead to a variety of unreimbursed expenses.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, people with health insurance fare better financially than those lacking it, and the study helps measure the difference. For instance: Four years after hospital admissions, people with insurance owe $300 more in unpaid medical bills, on average, while people without insurance have an average increase of $6,000 in unpaid medical bills.</p>
<p><strong>Time to rethink insurance?</strong></p>
<p>As for the precise mechanism through which hospitalization leads to dire economic outcomes, there is almost certainly a wide variety of scenarios in play. Serious health problems may impair people&#8217;s ability to work, make them less desirable to employers, or reduce their likelihood of searching for new and higher-paying jobs.</p>
<p>Because the study focuses on a very large number of individuals who had not been previously hospitalized, and examines changes to their economic situations after these events occured, it is clear that the serious medical events leading to the hospitalizations triggered the ensuing financial effects; it is not that people previously suffering from serious health problems were dropping out of the work force due to those prior problems. Therefore, Kluender says, the scholars can "confidently conclude it is a causal relationship and not just a correlation."</p>
<p>In policy terms, the researchers say, the results also show the limits of health insurance in the U.S. Insurance programs are designed to reimburse most medical costs. But since medical costs are only one part of the financial hardship resulting from hospital stays &#8212; with the decline in income being so significant as well &#8212; insurance as currently conceptualized may be incomplete.</p>
<p>As the paper notes, health shocks to households with people under the age of 60 in Denmark also produce a decline in earnings of 15 percent to 20 percent &#8212; but about 50 percent of that income drop is insured in various forms, including sick pay and disability insurance.</p>
<p>"Most of the time when you&#8217;re thinking about health insurance, you&#8217;re only talking about the risk of accruing medical expenses," Kluender says. "But in the U.S. we lack the robust sick leave and disability policies that protect households against the risk of lost earnings while you&#8217;re sick."</p>
<p>Finkelstein, for her part, also says that the results open up a series of policy questions about whether the U.S. needs more robust short-term disability policies to compensate for the lost earnings that occur after hospital stays.</p>
<p>"The glass half full is that there&#8217;s a lot of coverage for medical expenditures," Finkelstein says. "The glass half empty, if you&#8217;re a prime-age worker, is there&#8217;s much less coverage for employment and earnings losses in the event of poor health."</p>

This strong faculty response is testament to the energy and engagement of our community. The review and prioritization process may identify any of these themes as one of our academic priority areas.&#160;<br/><br/>We began by launching a Google spreadsheet that listed 20 themes that were developed by individual faculty or faculty teams, the Academic Senate, our Senate faculty Insights survey, campus focus groups, and open forums. Then we invited academic employees who wished to collaborate in areas not represented on the initial list to propose additional groups. <strong>Through this process, more than 80 new themes emerged</strong>. &#160;<br/><br/>Some themed groups represent existing collaborations that aim to expand their reach and scope, while others are imaginative new initiatives catalyzed by the SAP process. The groups exemplify the array of path-breaking approaches to teaching and research of which our campus is capable.&#160;<br/><br/>We&#8217;ve heard of many instances in which the process of developing, and signing up for, themed groups actually generated connections between researchers who&#8217;d previously been unaware of each other&#8217;s work. Providing a venue for existing groups to consider what they need to thrive, fostering the development of new groups, and connecting scholars across campus is precisely what we hoped the Themed Academic Working Group initiative would achieve.<br/><br/>In the coming days, we will connect all those individuals who signed up for the same themed group. And if the members of a given group so desire, we will find a meeting time that works for the majority, book a room, and invite members to attend their first meeting. Each group will be invited to submit a brief report on their proposed work by April 19 and assign one member to give a lightning presentation to an all-campus audience on April 24 or 25 (TBD), which we will videotape.<br/><br/>The reports and videos will be posted online with an assessment rubric to be developed through the community feedback received via the <a href="https://ucsantacruzfebruary.questionpro.com/#https://ucsantacruzfebruary.questionpro.com/">prioritization survey</a> we opened on Tuesday, Feb. 20. We will solicit feedback from the campus community and Senate on all proposals. Once campus and Senate feedback is generated, it will be bundled and sent to the SAP committees for review and recommendations. SAP committees will consider the merit of each proposal as well as its fit with divisional and university priorities; committee recommendations will ultimately be transmitted to the CP/EVC and chancellor for final decisions. &#160;<br/><br/>We are delighted to see the innovative and transformative work of our faculty take center stage in the SAP process and eagerly await the proposals and presentations from each Themed Academic Working Group.&#160;<br/><br/>Please remember that a Future State Design workshop&#8212;the first of a number of sessions designed to help us reach consensus on the broad aims around which the campus can coalesce&#8212;is set for 1:30-5 p.m. Tuesday, March 20, in 108 Digital Arts Research Center. Please RSVP here by March 15, and mark your calendar to join the conversation.<br/><br/>In the meantime, please ask questions, make suggestions, and engage us in this process.

<p>Online, people can lay out their vision for how the campus might look over the next 20 years. The <a href="http://lrdp.visioning.ucsc.edu/">visioning activity</a> offers users the opportunity to designate certain areas for housing, classrooms, recreation space and more. The submitted ideas will be shared with the campus LRDP planning committee.</p>
<p>The campus has also announced three community meetings through out Santa Cruz County. The sessions are designed to be interactive and ensure that attendees can spend their time learning about and giving feedback on the topics of greatest interest to them.</p>
<p>The meetings will be held from 7&#8211;8:30 p.m. on</p>
<ul>
<li>March 5 at Hotel Paradox, 611 Ocean St., Santa Cruz</li>
<li>March 6 at the Watsonville Civic Plaza building,&#160;275 Main St., Watsonville</li>

</ul>
<p>The meetings are structured to accommodate a variety of schedule constraints so individuals can come and go at their convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendees will be able to drop by various information stations on water, transportation, housing, environment/ecology, and carbon/energy.</li>
<li>Participants can share concerns and offer suggestions and/or possible solutions for each of these topics.</li>
<li>There will also be an interview/survey station where attendees can share their thoughts, concerns and ideas about any aspect of the LRDP.</li>
<li>Midway through the forum, there will be a question and answer session.</li>
</ul>
<p>The campus announced in May 2017 that it was beginning the process to draft a new Long Range Development Plan to guide the campus from 2020 through 2040.</p>
<p><strong>What's a Long-Range Development Plan?</strong></p>
<p>A Long-Range Development Plan serves as the campus&#8217;s general planning framework. An LRDP designates campus areas for certain types of uses, such as housing, classrooms and recreation. It&#8217;s not an approval to develop facilities or a mandate for growth. It&#8217;s an important planning tool for providing the infrastructure needed to successfully educate students. The planning committee is tasked with considering how the campus might serve up to 28,000 over the next 20 years&#8212;an annual growth rate of about 2 percent.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dd7189c0807270176c500acfb0a32fae"><name>holl-restoration</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fixing damaged ecosystems: How much does restoration help?</title><summary>A new meta-analysis of 400 studies that document recovery from large-scale ecosystem disturbances worldwide suggests that while ecosystems can bounce back, they rarely mend completely, with the final stages of recovery being most difficult. &#13;

<p>A new meta-analysis of 400 studies that document recovery from such large-scale disturbances worldwide suggests that while ecosystems can bounce back, they rarely mend completely, with the final stages of recovery being most difficult.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the new study also found that more costly active restoration efforts did not consistently result in faster or more complete recovery.</p>
<p>Coauthor Karen Holl, a professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz and a leading expert in the field of restoration ecology, said the findings are a call to action to researchers.</p>
<p>"A lot of money is being spent on restoration, but often not a lot of thought goes into how it's being done," said Holl, who oversees one of the longest-running, large-scale <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/03/holl-science.html">tropical-forest restoration projects</a> in the world. "We need to think about how well ecosystems recover on their own, and then use that information to design restoration strategies that are tailored to the ecosystem."</p>
<p>"People like to plant trees, but that&#8217;s not always the best restoration strategy," said Holl. "As always, we need better science to be able to use resources most effectively."</p>
<p>Lead author Holly Jones, who holds a joint appointment with Northern Illinois University&#8217;s Department of Biological Sciences and the university&#8217;s Institute for the Study of the Environment, Sustainability and Energy, echoed Holl.</p>
<p>"Our study suggests that, in many cases, once damaging activities are halted, the most economically expedient restoration strategy might be to let ecosystems repair themselves," said Jones, who led a team of researchers from five countries on the study, published today (February 28) in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em>. Jones earned a B.S. with a double major in marine biology and ecology and evolutionary biology from UC Santa Cruz in 2003 and was a visiting postdoctoral scholar from 2010-12.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings do not diminish the importance of active restoration efforts but instead suggest they can be planned more judiciously to maximize gains per dollar spent,&#8221; added Jones.</p>
<p>The science of ecological restoration is relatively young but important. Finding the best way to repair disturbed or damaged ecosystems is critical to stemming the biodiversity crisis. Every day, the planet&#8217;s biodiversity is being lost at up to 1,000 times the natural rate, according to the Red List of Threatened Species compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with a do-nothing approach, passive recovery involves putting a halt to damaging practices or disturbances, such as removing dams that fragment rivers or stopping the practice of logging and grazing forests. Active restoration often follows, such as stabilizing riverbanks or planting trees in deforested areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;When feasible, passive recovery should be considered as a first option,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Nature may not need much help after we stop degrading activities. If recovery is slow, then active restoration actions should be tailored to overcome specific obstacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can focus only on systems that do get a significant added benefit, we can allocate restoration&#160;dollars more effectively and restore more ecosystems that truly need it,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Because of its broad-brush scale, the meta-analysis likely failed to detect some instances where active restoration is speeding up recovery. Coastal prairie in California, for example, absolutely requires active restoration, Holl said.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis looked specifically at the outcomes of only two critical goals: accelerating ecosystem recovery and achieving more complete recovery. Restoration efforts, however, could be making strides toward unstudied goals that are important to local stakeholders, such as creating greenways, floodplain or urban gardens.</p>
<p>Holl said the new study results should be interpreted cautiously for other reasons as well. Site managers could be choosing to perform restoration on more difficult sites, such as forests that have experienced clear cutting rather than selective harvesting of only a proportion of trees.</p>
<p>Also, less than 5 percent of past studies from the literature compared active restoration to passive recovery within the same damaged site. To compensate, the researchers created a second, much larger data set, comparing recovery rates and completeness among different locations that experienced either active restoration or passive recovery. The two data sets yielded similar results.</p>
<p>The researchers identified positive recovery rates in all actively restored and passively recovering sites once damaging activities ceased, which means disturbed systems are regaining some of their biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. Most recovery rates were between 1 percent and 10 percent recovery per year, with rates consistently slowing over time.</p>
<p>The study authors cannot say for certain why restoration isn&#8217;t resulting in faster or more complete recovery. To identify where and when restoration will be most effective in the future, they recommend that restoration practitioners build formal or informal experimentation into their designs, directly comparing passive recovery with one or more active restoration approaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has rarely been done in the past,&#8221; said Holl. &#8220;These comparisons will help to show where active restoration efforts are most effective and how to better allocate scarce restoration funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones said the study also underscores the necessity of preserving untouched ecosystems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Restoration cannot be considered a substitute for conservation,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Because damaged ecosystems rarely recover completely, conservation of ecosystems that are not damaged will be critical to reduce the loss of biodiversity and the valuable byproducts of ecosystems, such as clean water, clean air and medicines developed from their plants.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ded547d8807270176c500acffd269b3a"><name>in-memoriam-william-friedland</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community Studies founder William H.

<hr/>
<p>William H. &#8220;Bill&#8221; Friedland, professor emeritus of community studies and sociology at UC Santa Cruz, whose life and career encompassed the major social movements of the 20th century, from labor struggles during and after World War II, to farm worker and youth movements of the 1960s, to the agriculture-food awareness of today, died at his Santa Cruz home Feb. 20 at age 94.</p>
<p>Friedland joined UC Santa Cruz in 1969 as founding chair of the Community Studies department, a unique and innovative experiential learning degree program that features a six-month field study with organizations committed to social justice.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/news-events/profiles/LovingmemoriesofWilliamFriedland.html">note on the Community Studies website</a>, current program director Mary Beth Pudup wrote: &#8220;Bill was everything to Community Studies: founding visionary of experiential education for social justice; audacious scholar of&#160;international&#160;agro-food systems, staunch advocate that the University of California serve the needs of all the state's peoples regardless of their rank or race.&#8221;</p>
<p>He first visited the young campus in 1967, invited to deliver a colloquium while on sabbatical to research agricultural labor in California. At the time he was teaching at Cornell University&#8217;s School of Industrial and Labor Relations where he founded the Cornell Migrant Labor Project that offered undergraduates an opportunity to use field study methods typically experienced only at the graduate level, a precursor to Community Studies at UCSC.</p>
<h3>Agriculture, production, and globalization</h3>
<p>Friedland&#8217;s academic research focused on agricultural production and globalization, and the impact of mechanization on farmers, farm workers, and rural communities. He was a pioneer in the study of food distribution systems and revealed the cozy relationship between UC's agricultural researchers and the state's powerful farming interests. His work influenced a generation of scholars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill was one of the key rural sociologists whose work motivated me to pursue this career and still shapes the ways I think about dynamics of technological change in agriculture and its implications for farm labor and rural communities,&#8221; said Douglas Jackson-Smith, president of the Rural Sociological Society, and professor and assistant director at the School of Environment and Natural Resources at Ohio State University. &#8220;His scholarship and voice within the community of rural sociologists will be dearly missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill Friedland was one of the key scholars who built the Sociology of Agriculture and Food as a field within the discipline of sociology,&#8221; said Keiko Tanaka, professor of rural sociology at the University of Kentucky and RSS president-elect. &#8220;Bill was also an excellent mentor to many younger RSS members.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Rural intellectual community</h3>
<p>Friedland found his intellectual community in the Rural Sociological Society (which he had first avoided because he saw little value in the rural) after attending a meeting in 1978. &#8220;I finally found a community of interest:&#8221; he wrote in <em>Our Studies Ourselves: Sociologists&#8217; Life and Work,</em> &#8220;social scientists focused on agriculture and concerned to understand the socioeconomic forces of agriculture and seeking to change them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The society named Friedland its Distinguished Rural Sociologist in 2012, one of many accolades he garnered during an academic and activist career that extended more than 25 years past his formal retirement from teaching at UCSC in 1991. The society honored Friedland and his body of work at its annual meeting and conference in 2005.</p>
<p>"His contribution was to look at the people in agriculture&#8211;the farmers and the farmworkers&#8211;at a time when power was being concentrated in global agricultural corporations. Everyone accepted that bigger was better until Bill came along and asked, 'Better for whom?'" conference organizers noted at the time.</p>
<p>Friedland's many publications include <em>From Columbus to Conagra: The Globalization of Agriculture</em> and <em>Food, Manufacturing Green Gold: The Conditions and Social Consequences of Lettuce Harvest Mechanization</em>, and <em>Destalking the Wily Tomato: A Case Study in Social Consequences in California Agricultural Research</em>. He spent more than 20 years researching a book on the California wine industry.</p>
<h3>Consequences of mechanization</h3>
<p>Friedland is perhaps best known for his study of the consequences of the mechanization of tomato harvesting. Mechanization ushered in a new era of efficiency, but, as Friedland documented, the workforce collapsed from 50,000 laborers to 18,000, and the number of growers shrank from 4,000 to 600, weeding out those who could not afford a $35,000 harvester. Meanwhile, total acreage doubled.</p>
<p>At UCSC, besides teaching, research, and running Community Studies, Friedland also served for a time as dean of the Social Sciences Division and helped create what is now Rachel Carson College.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill's campus legacies are numerous and his intellectual impacts are immense,&#8221; Pudup said. &#8220;He will forever remain a central figure in UCSC history. His presence and stature in the field of sociology made UCSC a hotbed of agro-food studies long before any of the people working today were around,&#8221; she said. &#160;</p>
<p>Friedland&#8217;s impact has been felt beyond the classroom as well, given his role as a Santa Cruz resident for 49 years. Countless of his students have served in local organizations and political posts. Mike Rotkin who worked with Friedland as a graduate student, coordinated the Community Studies field study program, and served several terms as a Santa Cruz City Councilmember and mayor, said Friedland's study of homelessness led to a more sympathetic approach by the city. And one of his courses led to a complete revision of the transportation system in Santa Cruz in the early 1970s, Rotkin said.&#160;</p>
<h3>Labor organizing</h3>
<p>Friedland was born to Russian Jewish immigrants on Staten Island, N.Y. After graduating high school and lasting a single semester at a Staten Island college, he spent 10 years in Detroit working on automobile assembly lines and as a labor organizer. He and a colleague collected labor movement songs and recorded two albums, &#8220;Songs of the Wobblies&#8221; and &#8220;Ballads for Sectarians&#8221; that can be found online at &#160;<a href="https://archive.org/details/SongsOfTheWobblies"><span>https://archive.org/details/SongsOfTheWobblies</span></a></p>
<p>Returning to college in the mid 1950s, he received his bachelors and masters degrees from Wayne State University in Detroit and his Ph.D. at UC Berkeley before joining first Cornell and later UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Community Studies provided a highly satisfying environment for teaching,&#8221; Friedland wrote in <em>Our Studies Ourselves</em>. &#8220;Because of its field study orientation and focus on social change, it attracted dedicated students who wanted to do something in the real world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friedland is survived by his wife, Joan, son Liam (Uba), daughters Fiona (Steve), and Nicole (Mike), and grandson Skyler.&#160;</p>
<p>A memorial is being planned for May 27 which would have been his 95th birthday.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://communitystudies.ucsc.edu/news-events/profiles/LovingmemoriesofWilliamFriedland.html</url><title>Community Studies remembers Bill Friedland</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="df605120807270176c500acfc0091eb7"><name>hunicke-hosts-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Robin Hunicke to host Game Developers Choice Awards</title><summary>Associate arts professor Robin Hunicke is set to host this year’s Game Developers Choice Awards, which will take place on March 21 during the 2018 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, robin hunicke news, tech news, silicon valley, virtual reality news</keywords><start-date>1519872300000</start-date><display-name>Robin Hunicke to host Game Developers Choice Awards</display-name><path>/2018/02/hunicke-hosts-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/02/hunicke-hosts-awards</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1519871085814</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1522262140745</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/Hunicke-vertical-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/Hunicke-vertical-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Hunicke-vertical-375.jpg</name><display-name>Hunicke-vertical-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>188586</file-size><width>375</width><height>469</height></image><image-alt>Robin Hunicke</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/hunicke-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/hunicke-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hunicke-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hunicke-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>32742</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Robin Hunicke</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Robin Hunicke&#8217;s acclaimed PC and VR game, Luna, has been nominated for a 2018 Independent Games Festival Award for Excellence in Visual Art</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Associate arts professor Robin Hunicke is set to host this year&#8217;s <strong>Game Developers Choice Awards</strong>, which will take place on March 21 during the 2018 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Hunicke is director of art and design for the Games and Playable Media B.A. program at UC Santa Cruz, as well as the acting director of the campus&#8217;s Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. program.</p>
<p>She is also co-founder and CEO of the independent game design company, <a href="http://www.funomena.com/"><strong>Funomena</strong></a>. Last fall, the company released Hunicke&#8217;s acclaimed PC and VR game, <em>Luna</em>, which has been nominated for a 2018 Independent Games Festival (IGF) award for Excellence in Visual Art.</p>
<p>The IGF awards--which honor the most influential, innovative and acclaimed projects in independent game development--will immediately precede the Game Developers Choice Awards at San Francisco&#8217;s Moscone Convention Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;I'm thrilled to return as the host of this year's Game Developers Choice Awards, and the whole Luna team is over the moon about our IGF nomination,&#8221; said Hunicke. &#8220;One of the best things about both the IGF and the GDC awards is that they come from the development community--a global network of creatives who work in game design, programming, art, sound design and production.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Making games takes so much time and effort, and pushing into new design territories, like Virtual Reality, also increases the challenge,&#8221; she added. &#8220;To be recognized for achievement this year, alongside so many other amazing games is really outstanding, and lets us know that our work in this area is appreciated by our peers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hunicke joined the arts faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2014 to develop and promote undergraduate and graduate education that explores games as a medium of critical, social, and expressive artistic practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;My work on games focuses on how systems, and the rules that create those systems, can create unique, specific feelings in the player,&#8221; Hunicke noted. &#8220;Luna is a natural extension of this work--inviting players to relax, explore, and experience a tactile environment in VR.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The curriculum I've worked on at UCSC is all about giving students a chance to craft games that investigate this same principle, while also learning how to collaborate creatively across disciplines,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teamwork, creativity, attention to detail while keeping the big picture in mind: this is how we solve all sorts of problems. Game design is system design, and system design touches all aspects of society--from politics and civic participation, to the environment and how we develop new technologies.&#8221;&#160;</p>

<p>The program, part of UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, now offers 65 online classes, including each of those required to fulfill the &#8220;a-g&#8221; requirements for admission to UC and California State University, as well as 26 Advanced Placement (AP) classes. With $4 million in state funding from the governor&#8217;s 2016-17 budget, the program added and improved dozens of free online courses, from world history and law to engineering and 3-D design. &#160;</p>
<p>Reflecting the university&#8217;s commitment to equity and access, UC Scout works to ensure all California students have access to a high quality college preparatory curriculum, no matter where they live and attend school.</p>
<p>Currently, 47 California public high schools do not offer the full &#8220;a-g&#8221; curriculum required for admission to UC or CSU schools. Access to honors and AP courses also varies widely. Eight percent of California students attend high schools that do not offer any AP&#160;courses, while another three percent attend schools with four or fewer AP offerings, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics and the College Board.&#160;Research consistently demonstrates that students who succeed in AP&#160;are better prepared for college.</p>
<p>&#8220;This program is a critical tool to bolster college eligibility among California students, particularly those who attend schools with limited resources,&#8221; said UC President Janet Napolitano. &#8220;We are grateful for the state&#8217;s support of UC Scout and hope even more students will take advantage of the opportunities afforded by this easily accessible program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through UC Scout, students can work through online course material at no charge under the direction of a teacher or counselor at their school, or, for a fee, they can take a premium course led by an accredited UC Scout instructor. (Some scholarships are available to cover the $169 fee for a course taken during a set term, or $299 for courses taken at a student&#8217;s convenience.) Schools can also use the platform and materials as a way to offer classes they might not otherwise have the resources to provide. All courses are UC-accredited and -approved.</p>
<p>In 2016-17, 259 schools participated in the UC Scout program, with 1,992 students enrolling in 3,672 courses. Enrolled students came from a variety of educational settings, including public schools, charter schools, independent study programs, juvenile justice facilities, adult education centers and community colleges.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to ensure that all students with the potential to succeed in AP coursework are able to take advantage of those opportunities,&#8221; said Scott Hill, vice president for the western region at the College Board. &#8220;We applaud the recent expansion of the UC Scout program, which will help even more California students prepare for college and career success.&#8221;</p>
