<p>His research on the calls male northern elephant seals use to threaten their rivals showed that the style of the animals&#8217; percussion-like vocalizations depended on where they lived. So, for example, a listener could tell the difference between the threat call of a male elephant seal from A&#241;o Nuevo in Central California and one from Isla de Guadalupe in Mexico.</p>
<p>Almost 50 years later, UC Santa Cruz Ph.D. candidate Caroline Casey retraced Le Boeuf&#8217;s scientific footsteps and discovered the seals&#8217; threat calls no longer had geographic distinctions. Instead, as the northern elephant seal population had increased, the males&#8217; calls had grown more individualized and complex.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1892/20182176">published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B</a> and authored by Casey, research scientist Colleen Reichmuth, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Dan Costa and Le Boeuf &#8212; all of UC Santa Cruz &#8212; showed that animal communication didn&#8217;t remain static but shifted over time in response to changing environmental and social conditions.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, it also demonstrated that scientists may need more than a single snapshot of animal behavior to understand how creatures communicate and live.</p>
<p>When Le Boeuf, then a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, went to study the northern elephant seal calls in the 1960s, the seals were climbing back from near extinction and the population was about one third of what it is today. Armed with microphones and tape recorders, Le Boeuf traveled to A&#241;o Nuevo, San Miguel Island, San Nicolas Island and Isla de Guadalupe where he captured and analyzed the threat calls of hundreds of male northern elephant seals.</p>
<p>Vocalizations are important for male northern elephant seals. They are used to drive off would-be rivals for the dominant male&#8217;s harem of females, thus conserving energy for breeding and avoiding injury from a fight.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if a guy walked into a bar, decided to brawl with one of the patrons and called out, &#8220;I&#8217;m Sam.&#8221; His prospective target would then call back, &#8220;I&#8217;m Bud and we&#8217;ve fought before and you know happens when we fight so maybe you want to back off.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when Le Boeuf went to the breeding sites in the 1960s, the male population at each spot was small and not only were their calls simple but they were very similar to other male seals at the same site. It would be as if every guy in the same bar called out, &#8220;I&#8217;m Sam.&#8221; But that didn&#8217;t matter among the small group of males. They each recognized the other. There were no outsiders coming in.</p>
<p>In his 1969 paper, Le Boeuf predicted that as populations grew, the geographic dialects would disappear. Casey, who had read Le Boeuf&#8217;s studies, wanted to see if his prediction was correct.</p>
<p>Armed with a grant from the National Geographic Explorer Foundation, Casey and her co-advisor Reichmuth set off to the four sites Le Boeuf had examined almost 50 years earlier. At one point, they were dropped off on a remote beach on Isla de Guadalupe where there was no electricity, no water and no food. They spent two years recording elephant seals at each of these sites during the winter breeding season.</p>
<p>Back home, Le Boeuf turned over boxes of his research, including his reel-to-reel tapes of male threat calls. Casey and Reichmuth re-analyzed the data using more modern techniques and compared it to the calls of the 171 males they had recorded. They also relied on the rich trove of data on northern elephant seal behavior that has been documented by UC Santa Cruz researchers over the years.</p>
<p>What Casey and Reichmuth found was that as the northern elephant seal population grew and moved between breeding sites over the years (there are now more than 210,000 individuals), that instead of sounding similar to other males at their colony, individuals began producing calls that were really different from their neighbors. These differences between individual calls were good because they enable individual recognition of familiar rivals during the breeding season. As the population grew, it may have become more difficult to know who individuals were when competing for access to females. Over four generations, the calls became individualized and more complex and the geographic dialects vanished.</p>
<p>Having years of research from UC Santa Cruz was critical to the study, according to Casey.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to understand the evolution of communication, we need detailed information that takes place over multiple generations,&#8221; Casey said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what this study does. It&#8217;s important to take what (scientists) have learned and evaluate it years later in order to see whether these observations are maintained over time.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="75cda763807270172739340fddcb86dd"><name>new-forms</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>More key forms digitized by Office of Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization </title><summary>After launching an online Invention Disclosure Form last year, the Office of Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization (IATC) has followed up this year by digitizing and streamlining its non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and material transfer agreement (MTA) request procedures.</summary><start-date>1543824000000</start-date><display-name>Office of Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization </display-name><path>/2018/12/new-forms</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/12/new-forms</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1543869670326</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1543869720420</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>After launching an online <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScybZh_1meZt7y15UqNnf28vRMSa3VpwmcQOqHYcXY1jYpqTw/viewform">Invention Disclosure Form</a> last year, the Office of Industry Alliances and Technology Commercialization (IATC) has followed up this year by digitizing and streamlining its non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and material transfer agreement (MTA) request procedures.</p>
<p>An NDA, also sometimes referred to as a confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), defines the permitted use and distribution of non-public information (e.g., a research proposal detailing unpublished discoveries) that you provide or receive. Industry partners typically require an NDA prior to discussing any sensitive or proprietary information with UC Santa Cruz faculty, students or staff in connection with a potential research collaboration. An NDA is not intended to cover transfers of tangible research materials, for which an MTA should be used.</p>
<p>An MTA controls an exchange of tangible materials (e.g., cell lines, chemicals, software, models, robots) between UC Santa Cruz and other organizations for research purposes. An MTA defines the rights of the providing scientists, recipient scientists, and their respective organizations with regard to materials, derivatives, and inventions that may result from the use of the transferred material.</p>
<p>An NDA or MTA is often the first step in forming a research collaboration with an industry or institutional partner, and the new web-based <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXHB_afpngliYN9qKY5RYRp9WTT3KIvM8Z2VPwO1sUxL8ELA/viewform">NDA request form</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3DEhdGcYvDwDRigALfaQeJRWes_Td8k1YtpVh9w7maXs2DA/viewform">MTA request form</a> greatly facilitate and expedite negotiation of these agreements by IATC. Once IATC receives a completed request form, we review the form information, reference our database for similar agreements and follow-up with the requestor within a few days. We also share the form information with the Office of Research Compliance Administration (ORCA), which helps ensure that all UC Santa Cruz research is conducted ethically and consistent with regulatory and organizational requirements.</p>
<p>Early feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Faculty members appreciate the streamlined approach and being able to start the industry agreements process with a familiar Google Form. We&#8217;ve shared this change with department chairs in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and Baskin School of Engineering, and we are now going to each department to introduce ourselves and share information about all the services IATC has to offer.</p>
<p>IATC has processed hundreds of NDAs, MTAs and other industry agreements, and is seeing more and more demand every year. UC Santa Cruz has proven itself a first-class research institution, and industry is increasingly taking notice. IATC looks forward to further campus engagement with faculty, students, and staff to promote scientific advancement and collaboration.</p>

<p>The nautical parade was organized by the Santa Cruz Yacht Club.</p>
<p>The parade&#8217;s theme this year was "Song of the Wind." Rusty Kingon, the boating club supervisor, said &#8220;club members struggled to decide between several design themes, but ultimately the idea of a Beatles-themed vessel was to good an opportunity to pass up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The design team created an amazing submarine replica, complete with a conning tower, periscopes, working propellers, and of course, Blue Meanies,&#8221; Kingon said. Adding to the look was &#8220;an amazing sound system.&#8221; Work is already underway to compete again in 2019.</p>

<p>Numerous submissions were made in response to the draft policy during the first system-wide review. Reviewers provided a number of different suggestions for improving the draft policy. This revised draft is responsive to those comments and addresses the following key issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is currently no system-wide uniformity or policy for ensuring open access to UC graduate students&#8217; theses and dissertations. This policy will provide system-wide consistency for these works.</li>
<li>Allowance for embargoes that delay the date theses or dissertations are made available in an open access repository.</li>
<li>Length of Embargo Period</li>
<li>Approval of Extended Embargo Period</li>
<li>Opt-In and Opt-Out Provisions</li>
<li>The timing of first System-wide Review</li>
<li>Campus-specific policies</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed new policy is <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/academic-personnel-policy/policies-under-review/pres-policy-openaccess-thesesanddiss.html">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Those who wish to provide comments on the proposed policy may submit them to the UC Santa Cruz Policy Coordination Office at <a href="mailto:pco@ucsc.edu">pco@ucsc.edu</a> by close of business April 26, 2019.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer, Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7adf894a807270172739340f5c6adfcc"><name>motors-surround-us</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Art exhibit highlights the ubiquity of motors</title><summary>“Motors Surround Us”—a collaboration between a physics lecturer, her students, and community artists—will be on display through Dec. 31 in the atrium of the Physical Sciences Building. </summary><start-date>1543910400000</start-date><display-name>Art exhibit</display-name><path>/2018/12/motors-surround-us</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/12/motors-surround-us</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1543954728334</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1543954728334</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/12/images/motor-exhibit-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/12/images/motor-exhibit-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>motor-exhibit-500px.jpg</name><display-name>motor-exhibit-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>215785</file-size><width>500</width><height>369</height></image><image-alt>The art exhibit "Motors Surround Us"</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/12/images/motor-exhibit-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/12/images/motor-exhibit-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>motor-exhibit-80px.jpg</name><display-name>motor-exhibit-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17931</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>The art exhibit "Motors Surround Us"</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>&#8220;Motors Surround Us&#8221; will be on display through Dec. 31 in the atrium of the Physical Sciences Building.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/12/images/bailey-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/12/images/bailey-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bailey-400px.jpg</name><display-name>bailey-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>152014</file-size><width>400</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Physics lecturer Stephanie Bailey</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Physical Sciences Building isn&#8217;t the first place on campus most people would think of to see a contemporary art installation.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s where you must go to see &#8220;Motors Surround Us,&#8221; an unusual collaboration between a UC Santa Cruz physics lecturer, her students, and community artists.</p>
<p>The striking 6-foot-tall exhibit features a cyclone strung with white lights shooting out of a large globe. Underneath, trains make their way around a track. Mixed in throughout are dozens of small motors created by physics students.</p>
<p>Physics lecturer Stephanie Bailey, a nuclear physicist by training, conceived the idea to help bridge the gap between science and art and to foster creativity among her students.</p>
<p>She said her colleagues were a bit skeptical at first but were open to the idea and fully supportive.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of them commented they had never seen anything like this and they weren&#8217;t sure what to expect,&#8221; Bailey said.</p>
<p>The motors were created by students in her introductory class on electricity and magnetism for non-physics majors. Artists Amy Buntyn Steinberg, Laura McHugh, and Richard Smith volunteered their assistance in answer to a post on a Facebook artists&#8217; page submitted by Bailey. The artists then figured out how to put the motors together in a stimulating way.</p>
<p>The title for the installation came from Bailey&#8217;s idea to highlight how ubiquitous motors are in everyday life&#8212;from electric toothbrushes, blenders to hair dryers and wall clocks.</p>
<p>Steinberg said it was interesting to see how different each of the student-created motors were. Some were very simple with just some cardboard, a battery and magnet, while others were much more elaborate and involved unusual items like a jewelry box and a flower pot. &#8220;It was super fun to see how creative the students were,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Steinberg was excited about the chance to collaborate with other artists and was impressed with Bailey&#8217;s innovative teaching style.</p>
<p>&#8220;My takeaway from the project is that everybody needs more teachers like Stephanie,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>McHugh, a friend of Steinberg&#8217;s, said the project was a perfect fit for her because she is a working engineer as well as an artist. She serves as facilities director at Theravance Biopharma, a biopharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>She is a big believer that STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) should be replaced with STEAM (adding the a for arts). &#8220;I am very right brained and left brained,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Sometimes the balance is really helpful.&#8221;</p>
<p>McHugh credits Steinberg with coming up with the big size of the installation. McHugh added motion to the piece, contributing fans to create movement around the motors.</p>
<p>Smith helped put the installation together. &#8220;He&#8217;s an amazing free-thinking builder,&#8221; McHugh said. &#8220;He and Amy built the whole thing. I don&#8217;t even know how they did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bailey was inspired in the project by San Francisco photographer Benjamin Von Wong, who builds art installations out of thousands of the same thing such as plastic water bottles or old computer parts. His artistry transforms them from boring items to something beautiful, she said, adding that was the same thing she wanted to do with her project.</p>
<p>Bailey hopes the installation shows a truth expressed by Carl Sagan:</p>
<p>&#8220;At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes&#8212;an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Motors Surround Us&#8221; will be on display through Dec. 31 in the atrium of the Physical Sciences Building and then may travel to other Bay Area locations.

This year the&#160;campus&#160;will be&#160;closed&#160;from&#160;Saturday, December 22, 2018 through Tuesday, January 1, 2019, re-opening on&#160;Wednesday, January 2, 2019. The&#160;campus&#160;community is reminded to turn off lights, shut down computers, and other office equipment, and close and lock exterior windows before leaving for the break.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the&#160;closure&#160;some housing areas and other buildings will remain open. Laboratory buildings will be partially operational due to special needs of researchers and scientists, and some&#160;campus&#160;units' work schedules may require staffing during all or part of the&#160;closure. Fire, police, and environmental health and safety services will be provided to the&#160;campus&#160;community during this period, along with necessary utilities and other essential services.&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you are required to work all or part of this&#160;closure&#160;on&#160;campus, you must receive approval from your unit head and principal officer. Once unit heads have concurrence from their principal officer, they are asked to notify&#160;Physical&#160;Plant&#160;directly of their plans to remain open or staffed during part or all of the&#160;closure&#160;on&#160;campus. Notifications should be made via email to&#160;allysonr@ucsc.edu, by&#160;campus&#160;mail to Allyson Raedeke,&#160;Physical&#160;Plant&#160;at Barn G (mailstop: Physical Plant Services), or by fax (9-5121) no later than&#160;Friday, December 14, 2018, and should include the specific dates that offices will be occupied, as well as the number of occupants. This will ensure that open areas will receive necessary services during this period when most faculty, staff, and students are gone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. Faculty is urged to announce the&#160;closure&#160;broadly to their graduate students who may plan on working throughout the&#160;closures.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you have facilities-related questions or would like further information on&#160;campus&#160;closure&#160;exceptions, please contact Allyson Raedeke at&#160;<span><u>831-459-5561</u></span>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Staff and Faculty </audience><admin>Mike Hanson, Interim Director, Physical Plant </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7c0f6a55807270172739340f97d686ae"><name>stamp-film-critics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>DVD box set curated by Shelley Stamp wins 2018 New York Film Critics Circle Award</title><summary>"Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers"--a Kino Classics box set curated by UC Santa Cruz film and digital media professor Shelley Stamp and executive produced by actress, director, and screenwriter Illeana Douglas--has received a 2018 Special Award from the New York Film Critics Circle.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, ucsc news, uc santa cruz news, lois weber, Shelley Stamp, Illeana Douglas, Pioneers women filmmakers, women in film, early hollywood, ucsc film and digital media, ucsc arts division, New York film critics circle</keywords><start-date>1543977900000</start-date><display-name>DVD box set curated by Shelley Stamp wins 2018 New York Film Critics Circle Award</display-name><path>/2018/12/stamp-film-critics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/12/stamp-film-critics</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1543974643368</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1543978427828</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><br/><iframe allow="accelerometer;

<p>It also includes an 80-page booklet with essays and photographs, plus eight short documentaries featuring interviews with historians and archivists, and audio commentaries for select films. <br/><br/>&#8220;The names Alice Guy-Blach&#233;, Lois Weber, Dorothy Davenport Reid, and other significant directors deserve to have their names celebrated next to DeMille's, and Griffith's as the early pioneers of Hollywood," noted Douglas.</p>
<p>"Just as these woman told powerful stories to raise awareness and educate, we must do the same. I am honored to be a part of&#160;<em>Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers</em>, so that these films, and filmmakers, can be put in the pantheon of cinema where they belong."<br/><br/><em>Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers</em>&#160;was just released in late November to much critical acclaim. <em>The New York Times</em> called it &#8220;a thrilling look at the variety of films made by women, most before they won the right to vote.&#8221; <br/><br/>And the <em>Village Voice</em> noted that the collection &#8220;provides a rare opportunity to see some of the greatest films helmed by early Hollywood&#8217;s intrepid women&#8230;filling in the blanks of the past and reclaiming the medium&#8217;s forgotten stories.&#8221;<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz professor Shelley Stamp is a leading expert on women and early film culture, interested in tracing the contributions women made to early Hollywood as filmmakers, moviegoers, performers, critics and theorists.<br/><br/>She is also the author of <em>Movie-Struck Girls: Women and Motion Picture Culture after the Nickelodeon</em>; co-editor of <em>American Cinema&#8217;s Transitional Era: Audiences, Institutions, Practices</em>; and founding editor of <em>Feminist Media Histories: An International Journal</em>.<br/><br/>Stamp will fly to New York to attend the 2018 New York Film Critics Circle Awards ceremony on January 7.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7fe7854c807270172739340fab2a1200"><name>sandoval</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Irma Eréndira Sandoval leads Mexico's anti-corruption efforts</title><summary>Mexico's new president tapped UC Santa Cruz alumna Irma Sandoval to lead the government's anti-corruption efforts.</summary><keywords>obrador, sandoval, mexico, corruption</keywords><start-date>1543996800000</start-date><display-name>Sandoval</display-name><path>/2018/12/sandoval</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/12/sandoval</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1544039137685</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1544039690677</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/12/images/sandoval-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/12/images/sandoval-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandoval-400.jpg</name><display-name>sandoval-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>27607</file-size><width>400</width><height>285</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Irma Eréndira Sandoval</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/12/images/sandoval-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/12/images/sandoval-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandoval-80.jpg</name><display-name>sandoval-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3651</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Irma Eréndira Sandoval</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Irma Sandoval will enlist the help of Mexico's citizenry to improve the monitoring of public works contracts and the use of public funds.

<p>Sandoval, who earned her Ph.D. in politics from UC Santa Cruz, has been a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Corruption at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. As comptroller general, she is now a key member of Lopez Obrador's cabinet, leading the ministry that functions as the government watchdog for civil servants. Lopez Obrador ran on an anti-corruption, anti-violence platform and won a landslide victory with 53 percent of the vote&#8212;more than twice what his closest rival got.</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador is Mexico's first leftist president in decades. An advocate for students, the elderly, and social programs, he invites comparisons to U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.&#160;</p>
<p>"I am very excited and deeply committed to what the president has called the 'fourth transformation' of Mexico," Sandoval said in an email. "It's a complete renovation of public life in my country."</p>
<p>Saying she is honored to be entrusted with the responsibilities of her new role, Sandoval added that she is "thrilled" that the president and the people of Mexico have high expectations for the new government.</p>
<p>In the months since the July election, Sandoval has worked with a broad team of experts from government, academia, and social organizations to design the administration's action plan. "I have also been working closely with President Lopez Obrador, who has asked me personally to lead the work to design the new norms that will put a new Act for Republican Austerity in place," she wrote.</p>
<p>In an interview with&#160;<em>La Jornada,</em> one of Mexico City's leading daily newspapers, Sandoval said she will use technology and enlist the help of the citizenry to improve the monitoring of public works contracts and the use of public funds. She wants to empower Mexicans to denounce acts of bribery, even offering rewards as incentives.</p>
<p>"We have to generate armies of citizen complainants&#8230; giving anonymity and labor guarantees to those who reveal acts of corruption, and perhaps rewards to those who help us to recover the wealth of all," she said.</p>
<p>The cost of corruption is estimated to be about 10 percent of Mexico's gross national product, which Sandoval calls a "conservative calculation." As a nation, she notes, Mexico is third behind only China and Russia in illicit financial flows&#8212;money laundering, human trafficking, organ trafficking, and other "heartbreaking things."</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador's election is a powerful signal that the people of Mexico remain hopeful and optimistic that the government can crack down on corruption. "The Mexican population is very stoic, and that should not be confused with indignity, cowardice or cynicism," she said.</p>
<p>Sandoval spent more than two years at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, where she studied corruption. In her 2013 paper entitled "From 'Institutional' to 'Structural' Corruption: Rethinking Accountability in a World of Public Private Partnerships," she called for a radical rethinking of the concept of accountability.</p>
<p>Corruption, she wrote, "is a matter of political domination, structural impunity (especially for the private sector) and social disempowerment. The fundamental remedy, therefore, lies in significant doses of civic and economic democracy."</p>
<p>Academia is excellent preparation for government service, said Sandoval. "Academia is an exceptional space for reflection," she said. "Working in the anticorruption laboratory that I founded and directed at UNAM allowed me to develop policies to promote transparency and tackle corruption."</p>
<p>Sandoval said she has always been drawn toward social causes, and "today the best social cause in my country is to participate in the government of this 'fourth transformation.' In a way, I have always been in public service, since I have worked for the National University, which is a public university."</p>
<p>Lopez Obrador took office following a period of unprecedented violence in which political candidates, municipal officials, and journalists have been murdered. Just after the election, Sandoval was interviewed by Amy Goodman, host of Pacifica Radio's Democracy Now! program. Sandoval referred to Lopez Obrador's election as a "historic moment" that synthesized many decades of struggles in Mexico for human rights, economic justice, and fairness and integrity in government and the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>In a discussion of rampant drug-related violence in Mexico and the steady flow of Mexican immigrants into the United States, Sandoval outlined an approach that will rely on significant investment in "economic, social, and cultural development." Mexicans, she noted, want to live their lives in their country, with their families and immersed in their culture.</p>
<p>Sandoval advocates greater government transparency and accountability, as well as individual accountability. She believes the "struggle to combat impunity&#8230; is really the other side of the coin of corruption."</p>
<p>Sandoval takes pride in having studied at the University of California, and she is particularly proud to be a Banana Slug. "The richness of the multidisciplinary approaches that we study at UCSC, the social and environmental consciousness that the university fosters, and the cultural diversity that we embrace at Santa Cruz&#8212;all are irreplaceable values that have guided my professional career," she said.</p>
<p>Sandoval expressed gratitude to her family members for their love and support; she is married to John Ackerman (Ph.D. '07, sociology), who teaches law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.</p>
<p>Sandoval encouraged today's students to study hard and "connect with those pursuing the best social causes, such as justice, democracy, and respect for all cultures." Then she added, "And come visit us in Mexico!"</p>

<div><strong>Recommendations if going to the beach:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Never turn your back to the ocean. Always keep your eyes on the ocean.</li>
<li>Stay away from and out of the water during swell events.</li>
<li>Stay further back from the water's edge and off rocks and jetties.</li>
<li>If an area is wet, assume that another wave will reach that location again.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to rescue pets that have been swept into the sea, most pets will make it out of the water on their own.</li>

<p>&#160;</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Chris Wilmers coauthors new report saying carbon-cycle models must consider animals </article-subhead><article-text><p>Advances in remote sensing technologies are helping scientists to better measure how global landscapes&#8212;from forests to savanna&#8212;are able to store carbon, a critical insight as they evaluate the potential role of ecosystems in mitigating climate change.</p>
<p>One factor often ignored in these carbon cycle assessments, however, is the role of wild animals. Compared with the vast capacity for trees and plants to store carbon, the conventional wisdom goes, low-abundant animal populations simply <em>can&#8217;t</em> have much effect on these global systems.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/eaar3213">new paper published in <em>Science</em></a>, a team of researchers including Chris Wilmers, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, makes the case that the very presence of wild animals can trigger direct or indirect feedback effects that alter a landscape&#8217;s capacity to absorb, release, or transport carbon. In reviewing a growing body of research, they find that animals can increase or decrease rates of biogeochemical processes by 15 to 250 percent or more.</p>
<p>Indeed, they argue that failure to account for the role of animals can undermine the accuracy of any evaluation of ecosystem carbon budgets. They offer insights into how researchers might integrate animal ecology, ecosystem modeling, and remote sensing to more accurately predict and manage carbon cycling across landscapes.</p>
<p>"The world is witnessing two great ecological changes: a warming climate and the redistribution of animals across the surface of the earth, often as a result of the loss of large predators and herbivores," said Wilmers. "Our work highlights how these two processes are intricately related and why we can't fully understand climate warming without accounting for the role of animals in the carbon cycle."</p>
<p>Oswald Schmitz, the Oastler Professor of Population and Community Ecology at the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies, and lead author of the paper, hailed the team's findings: "Some of us have been saying for a long time that it&#8217;s not just animal abundance that matters but what these animals <em>do</em> that is important."</p>
<p>Experimental and observational analyses have shown that changes in animal abundances can cause major shifts in capacity of ecosystems to store or exchange carbon. In some cases, these changes have even caused ecosystems to switch from carbon sources (when animals are not abundant) to carbon sinks (when they are).</p>
<p>In the Serengeti, for instance, the decimation of wildebeest populations during the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century allowed ground vegetation to flourish, eventually promoting wildfires that consumed 80 percent of the ecosystem annually and led to a net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; when disease management and anti-poaching efforts helped animal populations recover, a greater share of the carbon stored in vegetation was consumed by wildebeest and released as dung, keeping it in the system and restoring the landscape as a CO2 sink.</p>
<p>In tropical forests, the conservation of large mammals maintains vital functional roles&#8212;including seed dispersal by frugivores and support of plant production by herbivores&#8212;that promote carbon storage; a 3.5-fold increase in the number of mammal species, one study finds, increases carbon retention by 230 to 400 percent.</p>
<p>But the presence of grazing herbivores in other places&#8212;such as caribou and muskox in the Arctic or moose in boreal forests&#8212;can cause a 15 to 70 percent <em>decrease</em> in CO2 uptake and storage.</p>
<p>Human impacts increasingly shape these relationships, whether it&#8217;s through the reduction of wildlife populations through poaching, overfishing or lost habitat, or the reintroduction of species to landscapes.</p>
<p>Wilmers says that humans have played a huge role in shaping animal communities, from the composition of species to the distances, directions, and speeds at which they move across landscapes.</p>
<p>"If we want to understand how our impacts on animal populations, and/or our management of animal populations, scale up to influence ecosystem-wide carbon cycling, then we need tools that allow us to link the things animals do to their ultimate consequences on the carbon cycle," he said.</p>
<p>The authors review advances in spatial ecosystem ecology that can reveal the link between animal movements and patterns of carbon uptake and storage across landscapes. And they highlight developments in remote sensing that are enabling scientists to collect and analyze data needed to make these connections.</p>
<p>"We show the effects of animals are large and important, but also that remote sensing can greatly inform what we know about how animals alter ecosystems through time, whether appropriating biomass through herbivory or trampling or enhancing productivity through nutrient and seed dispersal," said Scott Goetz, a professor at Northern Arizona University who has conducted satellite remote sensing research for more than three decades, and another co-author. "New remote sensing technology, like the GEDI Lidar instrument launched this week to the International Space Station, will help us do a much better job of capturing the influence of animals on plant biomass and productivity dynamics."</p>
<p>The impact of wild animals on the carbon cycle becomes increasingly relevant as researchers and policy-makers consider the use of natural ecological processes to recapture and store atmospheric carbon within ecosystems as a tool to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>Researchers rarely consider wildlife conservation as a strategy to increase an ecosystem&#8217;s carbon storage capacity, said Schmitz. In fact, some believe managing wildlife habitat conflicts with the goal of creating carbon storage capacity.</p>
<p>"They think that animals either aren&#8217;t important enough or that you can&#8217;t take up carbon and conserve animals in the same landscape," he said. "Our message is that you can and <em>should</em>. It can be a win-win for both biodiversity conservation and carbon uptake."</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary team of coauthors included additional members from Memorial University of Newfoundland; Utah State University; the Universidade Estadual Paulista in Rio Claro, Brazil; and Stanford University.</p>

The annual award is the division's highest honor for faculty achievement, recognizing combined excellence in research, teaching, and service. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Millhauser&#8217;s pioneering research on the structural and dynamic properties of proteins has led to a better understanding of human biology and diseases. Much of his recent research has focused on the role of prion proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Prions are misfolded proteins associated with several fatal neurodegenerative diseases in both animals and people. Millhauser has also done important research on Agouti-related proteins (AgRP), which are produced in the brain and influence metabolism, appetite, and energy expenditure. Understanding AgRP mechanisms could lead to advances in treating obesity, diabetes, and other food-related disorders. </span></p>

Now, however, researchers have documented nitrogen fixation by an unusual type of cyanobacteria in the cold waters of the Bering and Chukchi Seas.</p>
<p>"This goes against all the textbook assumptions about where nitrogen fixation occurs. All the mathematical models for nitrogen input to the oceans are constrained by temperature because of this underlying assumption," said Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz and senior author of a paper on the new findings published Dec. 10 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>.</p>
<p>Katie Harding, a graduate student in Zehr's lab and first author of the paper, explained that in many parts of the oceans, productivity is limited by the availability of nitrogen. "Nitrogen fixation fuels the food chain in some areas, so it's important to understand what all the sources are," she said.</p>
<p>The nitrogen fixation Harding discovered in the Arctic is carried out by an organism called UCYN-A, which was first discovered by Zehr's group in the open ocean near Hawaii. After finding DNA evidence of a previously unknown nitrogen-fixing microbe, Zehr's lab eventually identified it as a type of cyanobacteria oddly lacking the capacity for photosynthesis. Finally, in 2012, they discovered that it lives in a close symbiosis with a type of small, single-celled algae. In this mutually beneficial partnership, UCYN-A provides fixed nitrogen while the haptophyte alga provides fixed carbon through photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zehr and other researchers were finding the newly discovered UCYN-A in increasingly widespread areas of the ocean, first in coastal waters and then in waters as far north as the Danish Straits. UCYN-A cannot be grown in the laboratory, but it can be identified and isolated from water samples using sophisticated cell sorting and gene sequencing techniques.</p>
<p>The new study shows not only that it can exist in the Arctic, but that it is functional and fixing nitrogen in Arctic waters with temperatures below 4 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Farhrenheit). "It's not just cells drifting up into the Arctic on ocean currents. It's active, and it's the only real cyanobacterial nitrogen-fixer in the Arctic," Zehr said.</p>
<p>Cyanobacteria (once referred to misleadingly as blue-green algae) are bacteria that can photosynthesize like plants, although UCYN-A seems to have lost this ability. Only some cyanobacteria are able to fix nitrogen, including Trichodesmium, which was once thought to be the main source of nitrogen fixation in the open ocean. Trichodesmium, however, doesn't grow in waters cooler than 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>"It's hard to measure nitrogen fixation rates in water samples and tell which organism does how much, but I suspect that if you were to add up global nitrogen fixation by UCYN-A, it is a substantial and possibly the biggest source of nitrogen in the ocean," Zehr said.</p>
<p>Although it hasn't been found in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica yet, Zehr said that is probably the next place he'll look for it. When his collaborators at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science first proposed looking in the Arctic, he was hesitant. "I didn't expect to find much nitrogen fixation at all, let alone nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. It just goes to show, you don't know until you look," he said.</p>
<p>"One of the interesting questions from a biological standpoint is how UCYN-A can tolerate such a wide range of temperatures, especially when the temperature range for Trichodesmium is so narrow," Harding said.</p>
<p>On a research cruise out of Nome, Alaska, in September 2016, Harding and other members of the team collected and processed water samples for analysis back in the laboratory. On-ship processing included incubating samples with nitrogen-15 so that any newly fixed nitrogen would be labeled with the heavy isotope. This enabled the researchers to measure nitrogen fixation rates and to show that UCYN-A was actively fixing nitrogen. Back in the lab, they used fluorescent labeling to identify UCYN-A and an advanced mass spectrometry technique to detect nitrogen-15 in the cells of UCYN-A and its algal symbiont.</p>
<p>The nitrogen fixation rates they measured in the Chukchi Sea were relatively low, but rates in the Bering Sea (at 10 degrees Celsius) were similar to those measured in much warmer waters. Nitrogen fixation by UCYN-A accounted for all of the nitrogen fixation measured in the Bering Sea, but only accounted for a fraction of the total in the Chukchi Sea.</p>
<p>"The rates in the Arctic are pretty low, so UCYN-A may not be very important there now. But if Arctic warming continues, it will become more and more important as a source of nitrogen in Arctic ecosystems," Zehr said.</p>
<p>In addition to Harding and Zehr, the coauthors of the paper include research specialist Kendra Turk-Kubo at UC Santa Cruz, Rachel Sipler and Deborah Bronk at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, and Matthew Mills at Stanford University.

<p>For reasons that are still little understood, the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field can suddenly &#8211; and without warning &#8211; weaken, start to shift around, and even completely reverse direction.</p>
<p>Records indicate that over the last 160 million years, the magnetic pole has reversed its polarity at least several hundred times. Called a &#8220;geomagnetic field reversal,&#8221; this has resulted in the poles swapping positions, with magnetic north becoming magnetic south, and vice versa. The magnetic pole has also undergone what are called &#8220;excursions.&#8221; During an excursion event, the earth&#8217;s magnetic field weakens and begins to drift but does not reverse itself. The field re-strengthens and the poles finally return to their initial position.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz geology professor Robert Coe will be presenting his paper, &#8220;What We Know and Don&#8217;t Know about Reversals&#8221; during the upcoming American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in Washington, D.C. this December.</p>
<p>Coe is an emeritus professor of geophysics, and has had a long and distinguished career. He has received numerous awards and recognition for his many research accomplishments. He received his Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, and did postgraduate work in Australia before returning to the States where he joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1968. He has made significant contributions in a number of areas, including volcanology, geochemistry, and tectonics. In the 1970s, he developed a method of more accurately measuring the intensity of the magnetic field in rocks &#8211; a method that bears his name. Perhaps his most significant contribution, however, has been in paleomagnetism, where he has been a pioneer in the study of magnetic field reversals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Earth&#8217;s magnetic field is restless,&#8221; said Coe in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Evidence for this restlessness first came to light in the early twentieth century when geologists recognized that certain rocks exhibited magnetism that was different in orientation from the Earth&#8217;s then current magnetic field. While given little consideration at the time, geologists eventually acknowledged the significance of this observation and became interested in investigating the phenomenon. A number of influential papers published in the 1960s &#8211; including a number of papers authored by Coe &#8211; shed considerable light on the process by identifying polarity transitions in both lava flows and sediments.</p>
<p>The process by which rocks get magnetized occurs when they are formed, Coe explained. Scientists know much more about how volcanic rocks become magnetized than they do about sedimentary rocks. As igneous rocks cool, for example, they become magnetized in the direction of the field prevailing at the moment. This process may take a few days or a few years and provides a &#8220;snapshot&#8221; of the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, he added. Consequently, by studying many different rocks formed during different geologic periods, researchers can create a record of the Earth&#8217;s history of magnetic wanderings.</p>
<p>One of the best records of the earth&#8217;s magnetic reversals comes from Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon. Here, a series of overlapping Miocene-age basaltic lava flows record a complex history of several thousand years of Earth&#8217;s geomagnetic history. Significantly, the Steens Mountain record bears evidence of a complete magnetic reversal that occurred at an extraordinarily rapid pace (between 3 and 8 degrees per day) some15.5 million years ago.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, magnetic reversals can be far more complex than even the best, most detailed paleomagnetic record on hand. Volcanic records are limited by the &#8220;discontinuous and episodic nature of volcanic eruptions,&#8221; Coe said. To better understand Earth&#8217;s geomagnetic history, Coe emphasized, we need to have excellent records not only from volcanic contexts but also from sedimentary data.</p>
<p>Highly detailed deep-sea cores recently obtained during drilling operations in the North Atlantic might provide the lynchpin. These were obtained from a vertical section of the ocean floor and provide a continuous sequence of magnetized strata.</p>
<p>&#8220;The North Atlantic records give one hope,&#8221; Coe said.</p>
<p>Today, much has been learned about reversals in the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field.</p>
<p>It is now known, for example, that magnetic reversals happen much more frequently than previously surmised, and that they can often occur at incredibly rapid clips. It is also known that the last complete reversal, which occurred 770,000 years ago, occurred over a span of less than 100 years.</p>
<p>Much more, however, is still to be learned.</p>
<p>Most importantly, geologists continue to debate the cause of these reversals.</p>
<p>&#8220;A magnetic reversal certainly has a large random or chaotic aspect,&#8221; Coe said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s active over many time scales.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although a number of theories have been posited, the prevailing explanation suggests that reversals are ultimately tied to the Earth&#8217;s convective motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Earth&#8217;s magnetic field comes from a dynamo-like action arising from the motion of the metallic fluids in the outer core,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Scientists have also debated whether a reversal can cause major hazards, especially to technology. Some have argued that a reversal would cause the failure of the worldwide electronic and communication systems. The question, however, is controversial and remains unanswered.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of talk about what makes a place welcoming for immigrants, and this research puts a number on that," said Juan Pedroza, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, whose <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/psj.12300?author_access_token=3l9ab7aoyjmmI1l4DinT44ta6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC65c4SrwH-4LiucjbfvFuU0Knp4CDQAXoB-LjaSj4DSy8YTt8rl6LkvL-IuxDmQAIZwtHgz4cdDkmWh2Kx13k31x">findings</a> appear in the current issue of <em>Policy Studies Journal</em>. "A sizable concentration of Hispanics&#8212;between 20 and 40 percent&#8212;provides the momentum and agreement that immigrant rights should be a priority."</p>
<p>Notably, there's a limit to the welcoming effect of living in a community with a lot of Hispanic residents: Counties with <em>more </em>than 40 percent Hispanics were more punitive, according to Pedroza, who analyzed 2008-2013 data compiled during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>"On the low end and high end, one in five noncitizens is deported," he said. "The protective effect is in the middle, when the Hispanic community is visible but not too large. That's when the proportion of noncitizens who are arrested and get deported drops to one in six or one in seven."</p>
<p>The uneven implementation of immigration policy is not random, and it generates uneven ripple effects in communities, said Pedroza. "Food insecurity, housing instability, foreclosures, families that are being split up: Some places are dealing with it every day, all the time," he said.</p>
<p>The most unwelcoming communities&#8212;those that exerted the least discretion in deportation&#8212;include Imperial County in California along the border with Mexico; El Paso, Texas; Charleston, South Carolina; and Mecklenburg, North Carolina. Among the most welcoming communities for immigrants were liberal strongholds like San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and San Jose, California, as well as Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and Newark, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Pedroza acknowledges that "we are in a different climate today" under the Trump administration, but he believes the "protective effect" is likely still in place.</p>
<p>"It's not the absolute numbers that that make the difference, it's the clout of certain segments of the Hispanic population in the community," he said. "Communities with a low concentration of Hispanics aren't able to develop the local, community-based organizations that influence elected officials like sheriffs."</p>
<p>Pedroza suspects that communities with more than 40 percent Hispanics, including many in Southwestern states, experience immigration quite differently, with Hispanic residents perhaps "splintering" between those who support the rights of noncitizens under arrest and those who have other priorities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Methodology: county-by-county analysis</em></strong></p>
<p>During the Obama administration, the federal Secure Communities initiative allowed sheriffs to use their discretion when deciding whether to turn noncitizens over to federal authorities following an arrest for a minor offense&#8212;typically a misdemeanor that carries less than a one-year sentence for conviction.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency charged with enforcing immigration laws, released monthly reports, which Pedroza monitored regularly for several years, juxtaposing immigration and deportation activity with changes in the size of each county's Hispanic population, their local deportation policies, voting patterns in presidential elections, unemployment, and crime rates.</p>
<p>Pedroza kept tabs on data about more than 3,100 counties nationwide; over 2,000 counties "qualified" for his study, with at least one immigrant arrest in their system. About 500 counties accounted for 95 percent of the nation's deportation activity, he said. Pedroza's results provide a broad picture of regions that supported cooperating with federal mandates and those that resisted compliance.</p>
<p>"Jails and sheriffs were making decisions about these immigrants without Congress looking over their shoulder, long before immigration advocates became aware of the Secure Communities program," said Pedroza. "Counties had wiggle room. We got an unvarnished peek at what counties would do left to their own devices."</p>
<p><strong><em>Changing federal priorities</em></strong></p>
<p>Secure Communities was retired by Obama in 2015 in favor of a Priority Enforcement Program that emphasized more serious offenses&#8212;and retooled the mandatory information-sharing component on which Pedroza relied. Secure Communities was resurrected in 2017 by the Trump administration, which has erased any mention of priority enforcement by state and local agencies in favor of a mandate to deport everyone who is eligible.</p>
<p>Today, counties that were generally less welcoming of noncitizens under Obama are speeding up deportation, notes Pedroza, who said local policies designed to accelerate deportation&#8212;known as 287(g) agreements, named after a 1996 change to federal law&#8212;are also on the resurgence, with the federal government training local police and sheriff departments to investigate immigration violations.</p>
<p>"State context really matters, and what the federal government is encouraging really matters," he said.</p>
<p>Pedroza anticipates a "Trump effect," not only in deportation practice but in consequences, including crime reporting and cooperation with law enforcement. "As deportations go up, immigrants become hesitant to cooperate with police, even to report things like domestic violence reports," he said. "We are starting to see it."</p>
<p>"We know from recent research that the consequences of deportation are tremendous," he said. "If enforcement is uneven, where the consequences are taking hold is going to be very uneven as well."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a3ed0a7d807270172739340f57605d40"><name>student-healthservices</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Health Services closures next week</title><summary>The Student Health Center, Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), CARE and Student Health Outreach Promotion (SHOP) will be closed for the following December dates and times for mandatory staff trainings.</summary><start-date>1544601600000</start-date><display-name>Student Health Services closures next week</display-name><path>/2018/12/student-healthservices</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/12/student-healthservices</link><created-by>jujoy</created-by><created-on>1544643479236</created-on><last-modified-by>jujoy</last-modified-by><last-modified>1544643543956</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span><strong>Student Health Services</strong>&#8212;the Student Health Center, Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), CARE and Student Health Outreach Promotion (SHOP) will be&#160;closed for the following December dates&#160;and times for mandatory staff trainings:</span></p>

<p>Henderson (&#8217;98 BS, History) joined UC Santa Cruz in August after spending 10 years directing parking and transportation operations for the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>Henderson will take over for Larry Pageler, who is retiring with 35 years of service to the university. Larry&#8217;s last day is Jan. 3.</p>
<p>An alumnus of Crown College and graduate of the Environmental Studies department, Larry began his work at UCSC as a student on the Crown Work Crew and as a summer conference custodian. In 1983, he was hired as an environmental planner for a proposed UCSC Research and Development Center, followed by roles within the Institutional Studies and Capital Planning departments of the Office of Finance, Planning, and Administration.</p>
<p>In 1990, Larry was hired as UCSC&#8217;s second Transportation Manager, where he led his staff to expand &#8220;sustainable transportation&#8221; options for the campus, including commuter vanpools, new bike programs and infrastructure, expanded Campus Transit services, and new Santa Cruz Metro Transit District routes serving UCSC locations.

<p>Yet even she was surprised by what she learned.</p>
<p>In her new book, <em>Standing Up to Colonial Power</em>, Ramirez portrays Henry and Elizabeth as "Christian warriors," individuals who dedicated their lives to educating and empowering Native youth, preserving Native culture, and holding the federal government accountable to tribal communities across the country. Decades before Wounded Knee and the occupation of Alcatraz, their activism sowed the seeds of what would come to be known as the Red Power Movement.</p>
<p>Henry Roe Cloud was a well-known policy maker in the Office of Indian Affairs who coauthored the Meriam Report of 1928, which laid the foundation for the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. He and Elizabeth Bender Cloud co-directed the American Indian Institute, a Christian college-prep boarding school for Native youth in Wichita, Kansas, that combined the traditions of Native education with a college-prep curriculum.</p>
<p>Ramirez suspects that the Clouds' Christian faith and their successful navigation of the highest levels of government prompted historians to pigeonhole them as sellouts who abandoned their Native identities.</p>
<p>Not so, says Ramirez.</p>
<p>"They fought back against the government, they fought for tribal sovereignty, and they built support for tribal identity," says Ramirez, author of <em>Standing Up to Colonial Power: The Lives of Henry Roe and Elizabeth Bender Cloud</em> (University of Nebraska Press, 2018). "My grandparents were actually doing work that led to the Red Power Movement."</p>
<p><em><u>Defying settler colonialism</u></em></p>
<p>Both born in the 1880s, Henry and Elizabeth's life stories span an extraordinary period during which government policy focused on shattering tribal identity and Native connections to the land.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Winnebago, Nebraska, Henry was a member of the Ho-Chunk tribe and became the first full-blooded Native graduate of Yale University. Elizabeth, an Ojibwe, was born on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota. When they met as young adults, they forged a union as partners in Native activism that would endure until Henry's death in 1950.</p>
<p>Both were forcibly separated from their families as young children to attend federal boarding schools where physical abuse was rampant, according to Ramirez. "It was kidnapping, really," said Ramirez. "Native children were treated like they were incarcerated."</p>
<p>Henry converted to Christianity during boarding school, and the course of his life changed when a teacher encouraged him to go to a college preparatory school. At Yale, he met Mary and Walter Roe, white missionaries who informally adopted him and whose surname he took as his middle name. He was later ordained as a Presbyterian minister. Elizabeth, too, was Christian. "They were being both activists and devout Christians," said Ramirez.</p>
<p>Henry and Elizabeth's advocacy on behalf of Natives focused on education, and they co-led the American Indian Institute to prepare students to become leaders of tribal communities, said Ramirez.</p>
<p>"At the institute, they read Shakespeare, and Henry told Ho-Chunk stories," she said. "They combined traditions of Native education with the college-prep curriculum: foreign language, history, English. They learned history from the Native perspective. Henry wanted to train Christian warriors and teach them to fight for justice for Native communities."</p>
<p>"They were becoming Native and modern at the same time," added Ramirez. "They were being educated to go back to their Native communities and fight the federal government, and to fight for their rights."</p>
<p><em><u>Compiling the first family-tribal history</u></em></p>
<p>Ramirez's account of her grandparents' activism, which she calls a "family-tribal history," is based on a combination of family and archival research. Ramirez, a member of the Winnebago tribe of Nebraska, delved into family records, gathered evidence of Native oral testimonies, conducted numerous interviews, and pored through the archives of the Yale Sterling Library, the Society of American Indians archives in Chicago, and the Presbyterian Historical Society.</p>
<p>Henry worked for the Office of Indian Affairs and the Brookings Institution, traveling widely to document the state of Native communities across the country. He focused on education, health, welfare, and their economic wellbeing. His work helped change government policy from one of assimilation to cultural pluralism, according to Ramirez. "Millions of acres were brought back to the communal reservation for tribes," said Ramirez. "The goal was for Natives to have tribal councils and a relationship with the federal government."</p>
<p>In 1947, Henry was named superintendent of the Umatilla reservation in Oregon&#8212;an attempt, Ramirez believes, to reduce his influence on federal policy. In Oregon, he fought for Native fishing rights and protested "Wild West shows" that promulgated the dominant narrative of colonial settlers overpowering Natives and relocating them to reservations, where they lived "happily ever after." Elizabeth was active in the National Congress of American Indians and General Federation of Women's Clubs. Once in Oregon, she continued advocating for education, encouraging women to go to college and become leaders of Native communities.</p>
<p>"This book honors a period of history from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1950s, when Elizabeth was organizing Native community gatherings that eventually led to the Red Power Movement," said Ramirez. "It shows how my grandparents combined their Native and warrior identities and fought for tribal sovereignty and cultural citizenship to fully belong in this nation. I don't think people have understood them, or seen how ahead of the time they were. Previous books completely missed all this."</p>
<p>Henry and Elizabeth had five children, including their daughter Woesha Cloud North, who began compiling the family history but died before she was able to complete it. Her daughter, Ramirez, took up the challenge.</p>
<p>Ramirez invokes some Native wisdom as she describes her grandparents' day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>"In order to do so well in high government circles, my grandparents had to be both 'good' and 'bad' Indians," said Ramirez. " 'Good' Indians seem to be assimilating and acting white, while 'bad' Indians challenge assimilation and act Native. My grandparents were constantly shifting, which is part of being Native. You learn how to shape shift. We have a lot of stories about shape shifting&#8212;trickster stories about creatures taking different forms in different settings. There's a lot of humor and creativity in these stories."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aa08c6af807270172739340fd4a1cabf"><name>mangel-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Mathematical biologist Marc Mangel honored by American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists</title><summary>Marc Mangel, distinguished research professor of applied mathematics, has been chosen to receive the Outstanding Achievement Award of the American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists </summary><keywords>Marc Mangel</keywords><start-date>1544688000000</start-date><display-name>Mathematical biologist Marc Mangel honored by American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists</display-name><path>/2018/12/mangel-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/12/mangel-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1544745960159</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1544746202810</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/marc-mangel-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/marc-mangel-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marc-mangel-350.jpg</name><display-name>marc-mangel-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>70427</file-size><width>350</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Marc Mangel</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/marc-mangel-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/marc-mangel-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>marc-mangel-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>marc-mangel-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21991</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Marc Mangel</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Marc Mangel</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Marc Mangel, distinguished research professor of applied mathematics in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been chosen to receive the Outstanding Achievement Award of the American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists (AIFRB).</span></p>

Santa Cruz literature lecturer Gary Young has just released <em>That's What I Thought</em>, a new poetry collection which has been honored with the Lexi Rudnitsky Editor's Choice Award from Persea Books in New York City. <br/><br/>Young&#8217;s eighth book of poetry, it contains a number of poems included in his recent limited edition artist's book, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/04/young-in-japan.html"><em><strong>In Japan</strong></em></a>, and features his own artwork on the cover. <br/><br/>&#8220;<em>That's What I Thought&#160;</em>includes poems written over the past several&#160;years that&#160;investigate place, and how the external world generates and sustains a landscape of memory,&#8221; said Young. &#8220;I think that grammar can provide a kind of map that will guide us through the topography of a poem, and that we locate ourselves at the coordinates of internal maps drawn from experience and relived through recollection and reverie.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;These poems address specific places and events that I've internalized, and which have become enduring, immutable aspects of my identity&#8212;my life as a parent, and my home in the Santa Cruz Mountains, but also my bonds to Wyoming, Mexico, Italy, and Japan,&#8221; he added.&#160;<br/><br/>Young has additionally just published <em>Precious Mirror</em>--a book of Zen priest Kobun Chino Otogawa's calligraphy with Young&#8217;s translations from the Japanese--as part of the <em>Companions for the Journey</em> series from White Pine Press. The calligraphy includes original poems, as well as quotes from Zen Master Dogen, and from ancient texts. <br/><br/>&#8220;I met Kobun many years ago when he was living at my friend Hollis DeLancey's house in Bonny Doon,&#8221; said Young. &#8220;After Kobun died, I was asked to print a memorial letterpress edition of a selection of his calligraphy. I spent a couple of years going through it, letting it soak in, and finally pulled out a selection I thought would make a good grouping and would also reproduce well.&#8221;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#8220;After I'd compiled the group, I was asked if I'd be willing to translate the texts. I said yes, of course, and two weeks later I was in the zendo at the Hokyoji Temple in Japan.&#8221;<br/><br/>Young spent a week there, where he met Aramaki Noritoshi, a retired professor of Buddhism at Kyoto University, who agreed to help him with his translations.<br/><br/>&#8220;I spent three weeks working out the often hard-to-read calligraphy, prepared a rough translation, then a more &#8216;poetic translation,&#8217; then spent a day with Aramaki making sure I was grasping all the Buddhist allusions,&#8221; Young recalled. &#8220;The poems and the bits of scripture are short, but naturally, there's a lot packed into them.&#8221;<br/><br/>Young graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1973 and received his M.F.A. from UC Irvine in 1975. He has taught poetry as a lecturer in creative writing in UCSC&#8217;s Literature Department since 2005. Young is also the director of the Cowell Press, where he teaches printing and book arts.&#8232;&#8232;</p>
<p>His previous books include&#160;<em>Pleasure, Hands, The Dream of A Moral Life</em>&#160;(winner of the James D. Phelan Award),&#160;<em>Days, Braver Deeds</em>&#160;(winner of the Peregrine Smith Poetry Prize), and&#160;<em>No Other Life</em>&#160;(winner of the Poetry Society of America's William Carlos Williams Award for best book of the year published by a university, literary, or independent press).<br/><br/>Young&#8217;s print work is represented in collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and The Getty Center for the Arts.<br/><br/><em>That's What I Thought</em> includes several poems about wildfires Young experienced near his home in the Santa Cruz mountains. Here are two fire poems from the book&#8212;the first is about the 2008 Martin Fire in Bonny Doon, and the second reflects on the 2009 Lockheed Fire in the same area.<br/><br/><em>The blaze spread quickly through the heavy brush, crowned </em><br/><em>in the pines, and exploded in the redwoods. Flames rose and fell as </em><br/><em>if the woods were breathing fire. My family was safe, evacuated </em><br/><em>from the mountain, but I stayed behind to save the house if </em><br/><em>I could. I sat in the dark and smoked a fat cigar, blew smoke at </em><br/><em>the smoke that rose from the ruin of the forest. Sparks flew all </em><br/><em>around. Everything was turning to smoke and snowy ash. I took </em><br/><em>a breath, and held it.</em> --Gary Young<br/><br/><br/><em>The fire grew larger every day, an enormous arrow of flame</em><br/><em>pointed at our house. For three days I hiked through the woods </em><br/><em>to avoid roadblocks, and watered the garden and my trees. The</em><br/><em>air was tinted yellow by the smoke, and even things close at</em><br/><em>hand seemed far away. The few birds that remained sang songs</em><br/><em>I didn&#8217;t recognize, songs I&#8217;d never heard. Our house was saved,</em><br/><em>but when the flames turned away for good, I felt defeated.

<div></div>
<div>Impacts:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Significantly increased risk of rip currents and sneaker waves.</li>
<li>Large and dangerous breaking waves.</li>
<li>Increased risk of strong longshore current.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Recommendations if going to the beach:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Never turn your back to the ocean. Always keep your eyes on the ocean.</li>
<li>Stay away from and out of the water during swell events.</li>
<li>Stay further back from the water's edge and off rocks and jetties.</li>
<li>Obey beach closure signs.&#160;</li>
<li>If an area is wet, assume that another wave will reach that location again.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to rescue pets that have been swept into the sea, most pets will make it out of the water on their own.</li>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than two decades after he died of cancer at age 60, the artist, groundbreaking muralist, and beloved UC Santa Cruz professor Eduardo Carrillo is getting long-overdue recognition and national exposure, thanks to an acclaimed touring retrospective of his artwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m just thrilled," said Betsy Andersen (Porter &#8216;78, art),</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">executive director of museoeduardocarrillo.org, a comprehensive online gallery of his work. &#8220;This is a huge celebratory party for Eduardo. I have known for so long, and in such a deep way, that his work was monumental and profoundly influential.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andersen said this collection of artwork is doing more than just inspiring museum-goers; it is also bringing about mini-reunions of Carrillo&#8217;s artistic cohorts and collaborators, who are visiting the show together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eduardo Carrillo: Testament of the Spirit&#8221; is making the rounds, traveling from one prestigious space to another, and giving museum visitors an immersive look at 60 works. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition is </span><a href="http://www.tritonmuseum.org/exhibitions_carrillo.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now on display at the Triton Museum of Art in Santa Clara </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">through January 27, 2019. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show places a strong emphasis on Carrillo&#8217;s imagery, which has been described as &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mystical, realistic, surreal, and visionary&#8221; and yet &#8220;grounded in the everyday world,&#8221; while spotlighting Carrillo&#8217;s roles as a teacher, scholar, and social activist. The exhibition also makes a strong case that Carrillo was one of Chicano Art&#8217;s founding visionaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the exhibition was housed in the Pasadena Museum of California Art.&#160;This summer, the exhibition was on display at the Crocker Museum of Art in Sacramento, where it closed in the fall. The show received a laudatory review in the <i>Sacramento Bee, </i>which paid special attention to Carrillo's masterpiece, "Las Tropicanas," a magisterial 84-by-132-inch work that former <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> art critic Kenneth Baker grouped among "the most remarkable paintings made in the Bay Area in the 1970s."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting in April 2019, the exhibition's travels will continue. It will open at American University in Washington, D.C. and be on view there until June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrillo left a lasting legacy at UC Santa Cruz. He was a founding member of Oakes College and served as a fellow of both Oakes and Porter colleges.&#160;M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of UC Santa Cruz at the time of his death, once described him as &#8220;an extraordinarily&#160;talented artist, an imaginative, dedicated teacher, and a gentle, considerate person.&#8221; Carrillo once described himself as a &#8220;trained, disciplined observer with a humanistic viewpoint and an eye toward the spiritual and aesthetic in art.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He taught at UC Santa Cruz for over 25 years, giving his students&#8212;including Betsy Miller Andersen&#8212;an immersive sense of collaborative art. He taught drawing, art history, ceramics, shadow puppetry, mural, fresco, and his main focus, oil and watercolor painting.&#160;He created set designs for local and national theater productions, brought art programs to children and teenagers, and supported emerging artists in the Beach Flats area. His work has been exhibited for 40 years in dozens of solo and group shows in museums and galleries throughout the U.S. and Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrillo&#8217;s themes explore his Mexican roots, including the pre-Columbian era and more recent historical topics.&#160;Unfortunately, some of his most striking artworks have been whitewashed over, including the monumental Birth, Death and Regeneration mural filling the Palomar Arcade walkway in downtown Santa Cruz. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also the first official UC Santa Cruz &#8220;Year of Alumni," celebrating the success and influence of Banana Slugs across the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year was a time of big change on campus, with the announcement of an </span><a href="https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/kresge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambitious renewal project aiming to update iconic Kresge College,</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">knitting beloved landmarks with new upgrades to continue a legacy while accommodating today's student body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other major changes were bittersweet. This fall, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal announced his plans to retire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have decided that the time is right for me to step aside and allow someone else to assume the leadership of this remarkable institution,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC President Janet Napolitano </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/ucop-message-chancellor.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised and thanked Blumenthal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his years of service and his &#8220;exceptional career at the University of California [that] has spanned more than 46 years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of extraordinary service, J. Herman Blake, the beloved founding provost of Oakes College, was back on campus for the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/oakesnamechange.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rededication of the Oakes Provost House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was named after Blake during an emotional ceremony. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake was &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; to hear about this honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the provost&#160;house, we saw it all. It reflected the extraordinary natural setting of UC Santa Cruz&#8212;the redwoods, the view of the bay, and all of nature&#8212;human nature, intellectual nature, and the social bond. All these things came together there,&#8221; Blake said. Listen to this </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/oakes-honor-blake-feature-podcast.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including Blake&#8217;s remarks at the renaming ceremony.</span></p>
<p><strong>Generosity, preservation, and a &#8220;gonzo&#8221; donation</strong><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>There were no dull moments on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s busy campus calendar. In any given day, something big was happening. The year started off with </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/giving-day-2018-feature-wrapup.html?utm_source=03-06-2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday"><span>an impressive burst of philanthropy</span></a><span>, when UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Giving Day, </span><span>&#160;a 24-hour online festival of giving, smashed previous records, with donors kicking in $520,000 for 122 worthy projects.&#160;Giving Day 2018 yielded more than $600,000 with more than 6,300 gifts for 160 projects, according to preliminary tallies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this action-packed year, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Library system proved once again that it is far more than a peaceful place for books and contemplation. Its staff painstakingly digitized over </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/library-mass-digitization.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6,000 photos from the Pirkle Jones/Ruth-Marion Baruch collection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and gratefully accepted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an impressive new collection of pioneering gonzo journalist </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/hunter-thompson-collection.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter S. Thompson books and papers.</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Science in the news: stars, genes, fruit flies, and more</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a banner year for scientific exploration and innovation at UC Santa Cruz.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Astronomers explored the potentials of &#8220;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/04/deep-learning-galaxies.html?utm_source=04-24-2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">face recognition for galaxies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">," with artificial intelligence bringing new tools to astronomy. The Kepler telescope examined </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/kepler-supernova.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a star in its death throes</span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists pushed the frontiers of genetics. Using technology pioneered at UC Santa Cruz, researchers were able to </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/nanopore-genome.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sequence a human genome using a pocket-sized device.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Also, UC Santa Cruz researchers examined </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/genes-brain-size.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the link between genetics and human brain size.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A set of three nearly identical genes found only in humans appear to play a critical role in the development of our large brains, according to the study led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on the genes front, data science researchers tackled </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy challenges associated with genomics. &#160;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/tripods-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer scientist Abhradeep Guha Thakurta </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">won National Science Foundation funding to investigate ways to protect the privacy of individuals while allowing access to large genomic data sets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences distinguished themselves yet again at UC Santa Cruz. </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/beth-shapiro-hhmi.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biologist Beth Shapiro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was selected as Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. Scientists took on many initiatives that benefited the public good, from fruit fly research leading to </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/river-blindness.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a potential new drug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for diseases afflicting millions, including &#8220;river blindness,&#8221; to a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/groundwater-recharge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">groundwater recharge project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> informing statewide sustainability efforts.</span></p>
<p><strong>Humanities in the news</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Division was a consistent and impressive newsmaker this year, with a detailed special report on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">finding truth in today&#8217;s partisan world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and talented Banana Slug authors using their voices, and their literary talents, to make the world a better place. Alumna author Kate Schatz casts a spotlight on &#8220;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/rad-girls-alumna.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rad girls&#8221; under age 20</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with her new book, the latest her series of &#8220;rad&#8221; bestsellers. Alumna Reyna Grande penned a</span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/08/reyna-grande-alumna.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> op-ed on immigration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this year, the legendary poet </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/gary-snyder-poetry.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Snyder drew a capacity crowd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when he read on campus for the annual Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading. Often described as the "poet laureate of deep ecology,"&#160;Snyder has become a spokesman for the preservation of the natural world and the cultures that seek to protect it. In fact, the Humanities had a hand in some of the most button-pushing lectures and readings this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Computer scientist, composer, visual artist, and acclaimed author Jaron Lanier delivered the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/lanier-ethics-lecture.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this fall on campus, &#8220;How the Internet Failed and How to Recreate It.&#8221; Lanier&#8217;s most recent book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlines how the benefits of social media can&#8217;t possibly offset the devastating losses to our personal freedom, dignity, happiness, and well-being. But Lanier also optimistically envisions a new humanistic type of social networking that can lead to a better way to live and connect to the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this year, visitors to the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/night-museum-humanities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Night at the Museum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came away with an immersive sense of 1968 protest movements and their global impacts. </span></p>
<p><strong>Arts in the limelight</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was another exciting year for the Arts Division on campus, with creative faculty and graduates adding their expertise and vision to the world. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s eminent professor of film and digital media B. Ruby Rich was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invited to join the&#160;Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The world's preeminent film organization, the Academy is made up of more than 8,000 distinguished members working in cinema.&#160;Open to qualified filmmakers around the world, it is best known for presenting the annual Academy Awards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this year, UC Santa Cruz art professor Jimin Lee had </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/lee-korea-exhibition.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a solo exhibition at an extremely unlikely arts hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea. Established in 1953 as part of an armistice agreement that ended three years of brutal war, the DMZ is a 2.5-mile-wide band that runs 155 miles across the Korean peninsula, serving as a buffer zone between the two countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee&#8217;s exhibition, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Station: Until the Next Voyage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, featured original print works she began creating in 2013 to explore themes of the movement of the body and objects in space&#8212;in reference to migration, globalization, transportation, and mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs contributed mightily to the movies. An Arts professor&#8217;s film </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/lusztig-film-premiere.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">premiered at the prestigious Berlin International Film Festival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; the first feature film by </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/auger-syrian-film.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumna Bridgette Auger (SocDoc &#8217;11)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had its premiere on November 14 at</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> DOC NYC, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the largest documentary film festival in the United States; and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">19 UC Santa Cruz film students collaborated on a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/students-film-housing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feature-length documentary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the Santa Cruz housing crisis.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another arts highlight had to be heard to be believed. The Institute of the Arts and Sciences of the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division presented one of the year's most immersive events, <i><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/forest-thousand-years.html">FOREST (for a thousand years...</a>),&#160;</i>an&#160;epic 28-minute sound installation hosted by the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and Botanic Garden. This innovatove work by renowned Canadian artists Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller opened last spring in the redwood grove at the Arboretum.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who experienced this soundscape of clattering hooves, droning planes, birdsong, and battle cries will never forget it. The Arboretum and the Institute of the Arts and Sciences also introduced their beguiling &#8220;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/arts-future-garden.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future Garden&#8221; environmental art installation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, drawing crowds of curious sight-seers to its scenic grounds. </span></p>
<p><strong>Alumni in the spotlight</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year was a chance to savor the </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">far-ranging accomplishments of proud UC Santa Cruz graduates.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alumni had an oversized impact in everything from journalism to cinema, song writing, and searching the galaxy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to give you a very small sample of our alumni in the news, take a stroll through our </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/year-of-alumni/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Year of Alumni page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where you will read&#8212;among many others&#8212;the inspiring stories about the career of scientist, astronaut, and award-winning educator </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-sullivan-kathy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathy Sullivan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell &#8217;73, Earth sciences),</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the first American woman to walk in space; and the return to campus of </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/adilah-barnes-returns-to-campus.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adilah Barnes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowell &#8217;72, individual major in black theater, Theater Arts Department), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who worked with students from&#160;UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s African American Theater Arts Troupe in their production of the groundbreaking play&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Raisin in the Sun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;by Lorraine Hansberry, in which she played the role of&#160;Mama. The year was also an opportunity to recognize some </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/04/alumni-health.html?utm_source=04-03-2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading public health leaders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who got their start in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s celebrated Community Studies program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni seemed to be everywhere, whether they were </span><a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/dean-lecture-series-2018/employee-employer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">championing diversity and social justice in major motion pictures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or protecting and sharing the histories of beautiful murals with </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2018/03/these-walls-can-talk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Salvadoran subjects and themes in the walls of San Francisco&#8217;s historic Mission neighborhood.</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Alumni dominate Founders festivities</strong><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>Since we&#8217;re on the topic of omnipresent alumni, graduates of UC Santa Cruz were front and center in the latest edition of our </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/founders-2018-feature-story-news-panel.html"><span>Founders Celebration</span></a><span>, with a special on-stage dialogue featuring </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-mendoza-martha.html"><strong>Martha Mendoza</strong></a><span>&#160;(Kresge &#8217;88, journalism and education), Associated Press correspondent and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner;&#160;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/09/kahn-carrie.html"><strong>Carrie Kahn</strong></a><span>&#160;(College Eight/Rachel Carson &#8217;87, biology), NPR international correspondent based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America;</span><span>&#160;</span><span>and</span><strong>&#160;</strong><span>Mike McPhate&#160;(Kresge &#8217;00, anthropology major/journalism minor), founder of the </span><i><span>California Sun,</span></i><span> a daily e-newsletter that curates general-interest news about California.

</ul>
<p><strong>A weekend in the sun </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni also had their very own weekend in the sun this spring with </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/alumni-weekend-advance-feature-2018.html?utm_source=03-20-2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Weekend 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a moveable Slug-fest for alumni and their loved ones. Attractions included a tour through the labs of Science Hill, &#160;a roof-raising lecture about ethical universities, a peaceful stroll through an organic farm, and an energetic 5k run through campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three days of festivities brought an impressive crowd of 1,500. The many highlights included a dialogue between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">beloved feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker and campus provost/executive vice chancellor Marlene Tromp at the recently reopened campus landmark, the UC Santa Cruz Quarry Amphitheater.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A steady and reliable force on campus for four decades, Aptheker gave a powerful speech about the ethical role of public universities.&#160;&#8220;Given the state of &#8216;no ethics&#8217; percolating through the current administration in Washington, it is very hard to know quite where to begin today,&#8221; Aptheker said during the Faculty Keynote/Baskin Ethics Lecture. &#8220;The ethical collapse in Washington pervades the country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Faculty in the world </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker was just one example of faculty members taking strong stands and making a difference. Forget</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about those Ivory Tower stereotypes. UC Santa Cruz faculty and researchers had local, regional, and nationwide impacts. Earlier this year i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n a landmark court ruling that prohibits solitary confinement in Canada, a Canadian judge relied heavily on expert testimony by </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/haney-canada.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology Professor Craig Haney.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Haney, who has spent decades studying the psychological effects of imprisonment, was involved in the nine-week trial that took place last summer in Vancouver, testifying about the effects of segregation on mental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also this year,</span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/11/bonam-housing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Courtney Bonam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an assistant professor of psychology, studied how racial bias tainted perceptions of neighborhoods. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Sociology Steve McKay and UC Santa Cruz Sociology Professor Miriam Greenberg continued their work on </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2018/10/hope-for-housing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Place Like Home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">groundbreaking report on the housing crisis. With the able assistance of UC Santa Cruz undergraduates&#8212;more than 200 of them&#8212;the professors made international headlines for an ambitious project intending to calibrate the scope, and side effects, of the housing quandary. Their research incorporates hard facts, analysis, and human stories from renters all over Santa Cruz County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If recalling all the big ideas, accomplishments, and landmarks of the past year makes you feel a little breathless, you&#8217;re not alone. With 2018 fairly bursting with accomplishments and highlights, the UC Santa Cruz community is eager to see what 2019 will bring. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c329863c807270172739340fe860b542"><name>davidenko-faces</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A tilt of the head facilitates social engagement, researchers say</title><summary>Every time we look at a face, we take in a flood of information effortlessly: age, gender, race, expression, the direction of our subject's gaze, perhaps even their mood.

<p>Every time we look at a face, we take in a flood of information effortlessly: age, gender, race, expression, the direction of our subject's gaze, perhaps even their mood. Faces draw us in and help us navigate relationships and the world around us.</p>
<p>How the brain does this is a mystery. Understanding how facial recognition works has great value&#8212;perhaps particularly for those whose brains process information in ways that make eye contact challenging, including people with autism. Helping people tap into this flow of social cues could be transformational.</p>
<p>A new study of facial "fixation" led by Nicolas Davidenko, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, boosts our insights considerably.</p>
<p>"Looking at the eyes allows you to gather much more information," said Davidenko. "It's a real advantage."</p>
<p>By contrast, the inability to make eye contact has causal effects. "It impairs your facial processing abilities and puts you at a real social disadvantage," he said. People who are reluctant to make eye contact may also be misperceived as disinterested, distracted, or aloof, he noted.</p>
<p>Scientists have known for decades that when we look at a face, we tend to focus on the left side of the face we're viewing, from the viewer's perspective. Called the "left-gaze bias," this phenomenon is thought to be rooted in the brain, the right hemisphere of which dominates the face-processing task.</p>
<p>Researchers also know that we have a terrible time "reading" a face that's upside down. It's as if our neural circuits become scrambled, and we are challenged to grasp the most basic information. Much less is known about the middle ground, how we take in faces that are rotated or slightly tilted&#173;.</p>
<p>"We take in faces holistically, all at once&#8212;not feature by feature," said Davidenko. "But no one had studied where we look on rotated faces."</p>
<p>Davidenko used eye-tracking technology to get the answers, and what he found surprised him: The left-gaze bias completely vanished and an "upper eye bias" emerged, even with a tilt as minor as 11 degrees off center.</p>
<p>"People tend to look first at whichever eye is higher," he said. "A slight tilt kills the left-gaze bias that has been known for so long. That's what's so interesting. I was surprised how strong it was."</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly for people with autism, Davidenko found that the tilt leads people to look more at the eyes, perhaps because it makes them more approachable and less threatening. "Across species, direct eye contact can be threatening," he said. "When the head is tilted, we look at the upper eye more than either or both eyes when the head is upright. I think this finding could be used therapeutically."</p>
<p>Davidenko is eager to explore two aspects of these findings: whether people with autism are more comfortable engaging with images of rotated faces, and whether tilts help facilitate comprehension during conversation.</p>
<p>The findings may also be of value for people with amblyopia, or "lazy eye," which can be disconcerting to others. "In conversation, they may want to tilt their head so their dominant eye is up," he said. "That taps into our natural tendency to fix our gaze on that eye."</p>
<p>The effect is strongest when the rotation is 45 degrees. The upper-eye bias is much weaker at a 90-degree rotation. "Ninety degrees is too weird," said Davidenko. "People don't know where to look, and it changes their behavior totally."</p>
<p>Davidenko's findings appear in the latest edition of the journal <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pec"><em>Perception</em></a>, in an article titled "<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0301006618819628">The Upper Eye Bias: Rotated Faces Draw Fixations to the Upper Eye</a>." His coauthors are Hema Kopalle, a graduate student in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego who was an undergraduate researcher on the project, and the late Bruce Bridgeman, professor emeritus of psychology at UCSC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7d27682807270172739340fd2c305a9"><name>cpevc-revised-sap</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Revising the Strategic Academic Plan documentation</title><summary>Over the course of the fall quarter, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee and his team have produced another draft of the Strategic Academic Plan document based on robust feedback from the Senate and our community. </summary><start-date>1545033600000</start-date><display-name>Strategic Academic Plan</display-name><path>/2018/12/cpevc-revised-sap</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/12/cpevc-revised-sap</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1545245717055</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1545245717055</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h3>SAP Document Revision</h3>
<p>I am excited to share the newest version of our Strategic Academic Plan and implementation guide. Over the course of the fall quarter, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee and his team have produced another <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19uMNU2WhF_reFSc3_R8vxopl63e8udwM">draft of the Strategic Academic Plan document</a> based on robust feedback from the Senate and our community. Their aim was to recraft the document to reflect the wise counsel we received. While the core content continues to embody the high impact insights of our faculty that formed the first draft, the format of the new document has been completely re-worked, and the implementation section significantly revised. It is through the best insights of our community that this plan will reflect our aspirations as an institution and guide our next steps. Therefore, I am delighted to share it again and to invite your review and feedback. Between now and March 1, we welcome general comments and suggestions for improving the document.</p>

<p>The program director of the <a href="http://cabinc.org/2017/04/16/drsc/">Davenport Resource Service Center</a> (DRSC) has been named the inaugural <a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/activist-in-residence.html">activist-in-residence</a> of UCSC's <a href="https://rca.ucsc.edu/">Research Center for the Americas</a> (RCA).</p>
<p>"For me, activism is about being proactive," said Ambrosio. "Here in Davenport, we have to be proactive. We have to go out and talk to people."</p>
<p>The residency is the brainchild of RCA Director Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, an associate professor of Latin American and Latino studies, who envisions it as a way to forge stronger ties between the university and the community.</p>
<p>"We were looking for people with demonstrated leadership in nonprofit and community-serving organizations, and Isa&#237; really stood out to the selection committee," she said. "He has made a deep personal and professional commitment to social change and social justice in North County. He will be a great partner and looks forward to meeting with students, faculty, and staff."</p>
<p>As program director of the DRSC, Ambrosio oversees all services provided to hundreds of North Coast residents. The center runs a food program that distributes about 4,500 pounds of fresh donated food every month, as well as an afterschool homework club, a teen center, a walk-in food pantry, a summer recreation program, and senior programs.</p>
<p>It's a challenge to reach community members who are spread out from the county line all the way to the town of Davenport. Many of the center's clients are farmworkers who live on 11 ranches that dot the coastline from Western Drive to Swanton Road.</p>
<p>"We serve 600 to 800 people per year," said Ambrosio. "Every week, I go to every food distribution at the ranches. It's important for me to connect with them."</p>
<p>As part of the residency, Ambrosio will hold office hours on campus every Friday morning. He plans to visit classes, meet with faculty and students, and brainstorm ideas. He looks forward to helping students bridge the gap between the classroom and the "real world."</p>
<p>"The funny thing about school, is you can&#8217;t really see how the ideas and theories you're studying play out in the real world," said Ambrosio, who has a list of projects he hopes to develop during the residency, including a series of leadership workshops, and field trips for north coast mothers. "I want to hear fresh ideas that students and professors will share with me so that I can turn those ideas into real services."</p>
<p>About half the center's clients are Latino, including many recently arrived immigrants. "Most are low-income, a few are homeless," he said. "We serve everybody."</p>
<p>Now in its 41st year, the DRSC is one of six programs of the <a href="https://cabinc.org/">Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County</a>. The center is housed in a modest building on a knoll behind Pacific Elementary School and adjacent to the landmark St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church. Clients and visitors receive a warm welcome from bilingual staff members and volunteers, and Spanish-language materials are readily available.</p>
<p>Geographically separate from the bustling hub of Santa Cruz County, the North Coast is dominated by agricultural fields, open space, and windswept beaches. There are no grocery stores, medical offices, or dental clinics. For those without transportation, the area's remoteness is compounded by limited bus service. "I hear about people going to Watsonville to buy groceries at the Mexican stores," said Ambrosio. "On the ranches, people work, shower, eat, and go to bed. That's what I hear."</p>
<p>A former farmworker and a graduate of Cal State University Monterey Bay and Monterey College of Law, Ambrosio spent 10 years working with a faith-based community-service organization in Watsonville. He is particularly tuned in to the needs of mothers on the North Coast. "Latina mothers in the area have complex life stories," he said. "Many of them lack legal status, they don't speak English, they work a lot. They have a tough time communicating with their kids, and their kids' teachers."</p>
<p>Ambrosio hopes the residency will generate ideas about new ways to support mothers on the North Coast.</p>
<p>"Why is it so hard for them to learn English, when the men are able to? Why do they not gain legal status, when the men do?" he asks. "The moms are in a difficult position. What are the barriers they are facing? I want to develop programs or add to what we offer them."</p>
<p>For starters, he would like to organize field trips to UC Santa Cruz, the County Office of Education, the courthouse, and the police department to introduce them to local resources and familiarize them with the educational and legal systems.</p>
<p>The center supports all residents, including immigrants regardless of legal status. Ambrosio and his staff recognize that the climate for immigrants is far chillier under President Trump than it was during Barack Obama's presidency. Every door in the DRSC has a Spanish-language flyer posted on it, outlining the Constitutional rights of anyone in the building, in case of a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>"The environment is different, for sure," said Ambrosio. "You hear the teens joking about it. They're joking, but that shows that they are concerned. If their parents are undocumented, they are concerned."</p>
<p>Some clients are reluctant to provide personal information when they tap the center's services, and Ambrosio is careful to reassure them they he doesn't share personal information with funding agencies&#8212;only numbers. But the political climate has made it more challenging to reach all of those in need, especially those who don't visit the center in person. Hence Ambrosio's eagerness to collaborate with university partners on proactive strategies to expand the DRSC's reach.</p>
<p>"I'm excited and thankful for the opportunity," said Ambrosio. "I wasn't expecting it."</p>

<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Elsevier publishes more peer-reviewed academic journals than any other company in the world. Our contract with Elsevier, which currently consumes about a quarter of UC's journal subscription budget, gives UC students, staff, and faculty access to every article the company publishes. And there are a lot. Elsevier last year published more than 400,000 articles in about 2,500 journals.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">But the model is dysfunctional on a number of fronts. We support Elsevier several times over &#8212; giving them our research, serving as editors, reviewing articles for them, then paying to access our research online. This model also leaves some of our research behind paywalls, limiting the access of others.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">As UC is currently in negotiations to renew its contract with Elsevier &#8212; the current pact ends Dec. 31 &#8212; it is imperative we use this opportunity to alter our relationship. UC has always stood for open, global access to knowledge. By breaking down paywalls for scholarly journals, or at least significantly lowering costs, we can help force the creation of a more open system of knowledge-sharing. Wider access to information facilitates research, ultimately enabling advancements in a host of fields.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Because UC accounts for nearly 10 percent of all academic publishing in the United States &#8212; more than any public educational institution in the country &#8212; we have an opportunity and a responsibility to lead this push. Faculty members can decline to review articles. Researchers can decide to publish their work elsewhere.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">We need a contract that makes access to research more affordable. We need more open-access scholarship. I hope you will join in me voicing support for this effort.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">For more information on the negotiations and how they might impact UC's access to information, <a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/news/2019-journal-negotiations-elsevier" style="color: #00458c; margin-top: 0; text-decoration: underline;">please visit the webpage</a> put together by UC Santa Cruz library staff.
