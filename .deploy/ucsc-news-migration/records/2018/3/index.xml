to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's computing center earns CENIC Innovations Award</article-subhead><article-text><p>The project connecting the UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Hyades supercomputer cluster to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&#8217;s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center is being awarded the CENIC 2018 Innovations in Networking Award for Research Applications.</p>
<p>Project leaders being recognized are members of UCSC's Astronomy and Astrophysics Department and Physics Department: Piero Madau, Joel Primack, J. Xavier Prochaska, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, and Stan Woosley; members of the UCSC Science DMZ team from UCSC Information Technology Services: Shawfeng Dong, George Peek, Joshua Sonstroem, Brad Smith, and Jim Warner; Peter Nugent at the Computational Research Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; and John Graham with the Qualcomm Institute at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2).</p>
<p>Astronomy and astrophysics are disciplines that require processing massive amounts of data. A single night's survey of the sky with a state-of-the-art telescope can yield a tremendous amount of data, which is often analyzed in real time. Today, nearly all scientific research and data analysis involves remote collaboration. To work effectively and efficiently on multi-institutional projects, researchers depend heavily on high-speed access to large data sets and computing resources.</p>
<p>UCSC responded to this challenge by organizing a unique collaboration between scientists and technologists. Several units within UCSC&#8217;s Information Technology Services worked with UCSC researchers to win a National Science Foundation grant to establish a campus Science DMZ. A Science DMZ is an architecture developed by the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) to support faculty and research projects. The UCSC Science DMZ offers a 100 Gbps network connection between UCSC and participating institutions.</p>
<p>This effort dovetails with the Pacific Research Platform (PRP), now in development by researchers at UC San Diego and UC Berkeley in collaboration with CENIC. The PRP integrates Science DMZs on multiple campuses into a high-capacity regional &#8220;freeway system&#8221; that makes it possible to move large amounts of data between scientists&#8217; labs and their collaborators&#8217; sites, supercomputer centers, or data repositories without performance degradation.</p>
<p>Using PRP, UC Santa Cruz connected its Hyades supercomputer cluster to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&#8217;s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) over CalREN, CENIC's 100 Gbps optical network, and over 100 Gbps peering with ESnet providing connectivity to NERSC. Peter Nugent, an astronomer and cosmologist from the Computational Research Division of LBNL, was pivotal in this effort. This connection enables UCSC to carry out the high-speed transfer of large data sets produced at NERSC, which supports the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and AGORA galaxy simulations, at speeds up to five times previous rates. These speeds have the potential to be increased by 20 times the previous rates in 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;To accelerate the rate of scientific discovery, researchers must get the data they need, where they need it, and when they need it,&#8221; said UC San Diego computer science and engineering professor Larry Smarr, principal investigator of the PRP and director of Calit2. &#8220;This requires a high-performance data freeway system in which we use optical light paths to connect data generators and users of that data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, when Hyades was connected at 10 Gbps to the campus production network, data transfer was slow and cumbersome. Then, in March 2017, PRP provided a FIONA box to facilitate data transfer between UCSC and NERSC. A FIONA box, or Flash I/O network appliance, is constructed out of commodity parts. FIONA boxes are highly optimized for data-centric applications and act as "data super-capacitors," increasing the possible bandwidth speed to 40 Gbps or greater.</p>
<p>Computational astrophysicists at UCSC now regularly use the supercomputing resources at NERSC and routinely transfer terabytes of data between Hyades and NERSC. For example, the enhanced speed has greatly facilitated work by UCSC cosmology researchers Piero Madau and Joel Primack, who have been using supercomputers to simulate and visualize the evolution of the universe and the formation of galaxies while comparing the predictions of these theories to the latest observational data. The new connection also supports astrophysicists Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz and Stan Woosley, who use supercomputers to simulate violent explosive events like supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.</p>
<p>Brad Smith, interim vice chancellor of IT Services at UC Santa Cruz and principal investigator on the NSF grants used to fund the Science DMZ work, said: &#8220;The ITS division at UCSC is thrilled to be able to facilitate this important astrophysics research. With funding from NSF we were able to build a 100 Gbps connected Science DMZ, and through collaboration with CENIC and the PRP project we were able to connect our Science DMZ with important data sources around the country such as NERSC. It is through highly collaborative projects like this that UCSC continues to deliver on its mission to keep California on the cutting edge of scientific discoveries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By setting up a campus Science DMZ, using the data-transfer node infrastructure at the NERSC facility, and using the PRP cyberinfrastructure running over CENIC&#8217;s 100 Gbps optical links, UCSC is now able to transfer data sets at faster and faster speeds. The scientific achievements in this award are enabled by high-functioning physical and human networks, both of which are essential and notable,&#8221; said Louis Fox, president and CEO of CENIC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e291db76807270176c500acfdde01699"><name>animal-cruelty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reports of animal cruelty</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is aware of reports about a video circulating on social media in which a woman disclosed a deeply troubling act of animal cruelty. </summary><start-date>1519891200000</start-date><display-name>Reports of animal cruelty</display-name><path>/2018/03/animal-cruelty</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/animal-cruelty</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1519924664135</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1519925548934</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is aware of reports about a video circulating on social media in which a woman disclosed a deeply troubling act of animal cruelty.</p>

But the revered feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker is likely to fill the joint during <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/">Alumni Weekend 2018,</a> where she will make a passionate defense of universities as places of ethical and critical thinking.</p>
<p>In fact, she would surely &#8220;raise the roof&#8221; of that place during her faculty keynote address, if only the amphitheater had a roof to raise. She will be in discussion with UC Santa Cruz Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp&#8212;an event that is sure to be one of the highlights of Alumni Weekend, which runs April 27&#8211;29. Much more than a reunion, this three-day celebration is an extravaganza of good food, fascinating lectures, special behind-the-scenes tours, exhibits, talks, wine receptions, and even a <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/campus-5k-fun-run/">&#8220;fun run&#8221;</a> for the athletically inclined.</p>
<p>The Aptheker-Tromp talk takes place Saturday, April 28, from 11 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. Attendants are strongly encouraged to <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=2922&amp;cid=5227">register for this event in advance.</a> Tromp, a respected Victorian and Edwardian scholar and the author of several books, was a professor of English and women and gender studies at Arizona State University&#8217;s West Campus before coming to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Aptheker will give this presentation at a critical time. &#8220;The humanities have suffered a lot of cuts,&#8221; she said. She bristles when she hears of anyone downplaying the importance of humanities as a discipline. &#8220;Part of the importance is critical thinking,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you have an electorate that is voting on the issues, but is deprived of basic information about our history, our sociology, our demographics, then they won&#8217;t have a way to think critically about what candidates are saying and the way issues are packaged. That is, of course, a national problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also spoke with caution and concern about the ongoing &#8220;de facto privatization&#8221; of public education. &#8220;There has been a very strong, and I think profoundly unfortunate, push for years, more recently by what we now call the &#8216;alt right,&#8217; but also from conservative Republican administrators, starting in the early 1990s, to privatize public education, even before they started cutting funding for public education in California and other parts of the country,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She spoke of increased tuition at UCs, driving universities to raise more money from private sources to help fund teaching and research.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have a democracy if you don&#8217;t have a population that is educated in critical thinking,&#8217;&#8217; said Aptheker, who is a distinguished professor and Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies. &#8220;Just think of the problem of education in general, the underfunding of (K-12) institutions, as well as state and community colleges. The other thing that is important to recognize is that this successful cutting of funding for public education coincides with increasing numbers of students who are people of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think the UCs have made very great efforts to recruit students of color,&#8221; she added. &#8220;UC Santa Cruz is now a Hispanic Serving Institution, which we should be, given how many Hispanic and Chicano people live in Santa Cruz County. But I want to address the enormity of budget cuts, rising costs, and other issues, including housing in Santa Cruz, which is increasingly unaffordable for students and even for faculty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aptheker said she is thrilled to speak to alumni &#8220;because I want to address the importance of the university. This is an alumni event, and I want them to think about contributing to the campus in myriad ways, from giving to volunteering.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she also looks forward to an audience of alumni for personal reasons. Aptheker, who has taught at UC Santa Cruz since 1980, and sometimes runs into former students during her world travels, said she loves alumni events.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;It is wonderful,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;I love hearing the stories of alumni and what they are doing. I hear from them periodically. People write to me, and it is just thrilling. Some of them are deep in careers, doing fantastic work&#8212;social justice work, working against racism wherever they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>And recently, university staff calculated how many students she&#8217;s taught over the years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had more than 16,000 students,&#8221; said Aptheker in amazement. &#8220;Whoah! Geez! That is a very substantial number.&#8221;</p>

When gunfire rang out, Zimmerman ran towards Giffords, who was the target of the assassination attempt. Giffords, gravely wounded, survived; he did not.</p>
<p>That's the kind of man Gabe was, Giffords' husband Mark Kelly said during a private event to raise funds for an undergraduate scholarship established in Zimmerman's name.</p>
<p>"He had high-minded ideas about service and democracy, and he really deserved an entire life advancing that," said Kelly, a former astronaut who, with his wife, is one of the nation's most visible and vocal advocates of "common sense" gun laws.</p>
<p>In the weeks after the 2011 shooting, the <a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/allawards/zimmerman/index.html">Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship</a> was established by UC Santa Cruz graduates Jonathan Klein&#160;(Merrill '89, politics) and Alex Clemens (Porter '89, international politics), who were moved by the tragedy. The scholarship honors Zimmerman's legacy by supporting undergraduates who have demonstrated a commitment to public service. Among the attendees at the fundraising event were Zimmerman's parents, Emily Nottingham and Ross Zimmerman; UC President Janet Napolitano; Chancellor George Blumenthal; Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell; as well as scholarship recipients, alumni, and donors. The event was hosted by Nion McEvoy (Porter '74, literature) at Chronicle Books, where he is the chief executive officer.</p>
<p>"Gabe was a very special person in Gabby's office and Gabby's life," said Kelly. "He was the kind of staff member every organization would love to have&#8212;a hard worker who was really, really good at his job."</p>
<p>The reception took place less than three weeks after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in which 17 people were killed.</p>
<p>Calling gun violence a "horrific problem," Kelly said, "The saddest thing is we know how to fix it." He cited the impact of strong gun laws in states across the country and called for a legislative approach, acknowledging that "politics and corporate money" are formidable opponents. Kelly hailed the young survivors of the Parkland high school shooting, saying, "They are smart, very articulate, and they're angry. My sense is they're not going to give up any time soon, and they're going to be voters pretty soon."</p>
<p>"If Congress won't fix this problem, we need a new Congress," he said.</p>
<p>Giffords echoed her husband's remarks, saying, "Stopping gun violence takes courage&#8230; I've seen great courage when my life was on the line&#8230; Be bold, be courageous. The nation is counting on you."</p>
<p>Scholarship co-founder Jonathan Klein joshingly lamented having to follow Kelly and Giffords, whom he called "American heroes," on the program, and then invoked the Jewish concept of <em>Tikkun Olam</em> to describe his desire to "repair the world."</p>
<p>"Our country's in trouble," said Klein, but there are reasons to be hopeful, including the emergence of youth as a powerful force. "They're going to solve this for us," he said. "The Zimmerman scholars are the most amazing people. Their commitment to social justice and public service&#8230; This is how we're going to repair the world."</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/careers-conscience.html">Inaugural Zimmerman Scholarship recipient</a> Yethzell Diaz (Stevenson '12, Latin American and Latino studies and sociology) said she, too, feels energized by youth. Diaz works as a program manager with Digital NEST, a Watsonville-based youth empowerment organization.</p>
<p>"Today's youth often get a bad rap&#8230; dismissed as apathetic and entitled," she said. "But what I see day-to-day is what our country got a glimpse of after the horrific events of February 14th in Parkland, Florida," she said. "Youth are challenging notions of what's possible, and challenging us to catch up with them."</p>
<p>Chancellor Blumenthal presented Zimmerman's parents with a posthumous Distinguished Alumni Award. Zimmerman earned a degree in sociology from Stevenson College in 2002. His mother, Emily Nottingham, credits UC Santa Cruz with helping Gabe find his path.</p>
<p>"Before he was a talented adult, he was a teenager," she said, with a smile and a sigh. In his college application essay, he wrote that his "number one goal is to have fun and to get something accomplished along the way."</p>
<p>Four years later, in a college essay, he wrote, "It is my passion to see systemic change&#8230; to cause change in systems that are unnecessarily hurtful."</p>
<p>"At UCSC, he went from being a young boy to being a man," Nottingham recalled. He went from being caring and curious to wanting to take action in pursuit of societal truths. Today, the scholarship in his name identifies caring young people who want to pursue public service, and it "takes them from dreaming to actually being change makers."</p>
<p>Social Sciences Dean Mitchell expressed a desire to increase the endowment to fund a "fellowship of the fellows" that would bring Diaz and other scholarship recipients back to campus for an annual retreat so they can "work with each other and train the next generation."</p>
<p>"They'd be foot soldiers for peace, an army for peace," she said.</p>

"It's a great example of how women can work together to come up with solutions to what seems like a major barrier we've all faced."<br/><br/>Attending conferences is often vital for academic scientists. The conferences provide a place for sharing new research and ideas, forming collaborations, recruiting students and postdoctoral scholars, and making contacts with funding agencies. But they often lack adequate facilities and resources for parents. Many times, onsite childcare is not provided, and when it is, it is not affordable for those starting their careers. Dedicated spaces for nursing and lactation are either non-existent or insufficient.<br/><br/>This all poses a challenge for new parents, especially women. Women offer the majority of childcare due to biological (pregnancy and breastfeeding), prejudicial (pre-existing gender bias), and often socially driven demands. Not offering appropriate resources or support for these women to attend conferences may harm their careers and reduce diversity in academic science. In the long run, it harms the whole scientific enterprise by keeping talented people out.<br/><br/>The situation is slowly improving, but there is still a lot of room for improvement, Calisi said. At a recent conference with over 30,000 attendees, she found just three small, curtained areas for nursing and childcare.<br/><br/>&#8220;To argue that this is better than nothing is akin to arguing that, despite a hostile work environment, women should be grateful that they are allowed to work in the first place,&#8221; she said.<br/><br/>The article offers guidelines that organizers can use for conferences of all sizes and different types of venues.<br/><br/>&#8220;As academics who have cared for, adopted, birthed, primary parented, or breastfed a baby, while pursuing a career in science, we have compiled four concrete suggestions&#8230; for scientific societies and conference organizers willing to take a leadership role in creating solutions, either incrementally or on a large scale,&#8221; the authors write.<br/><br/>Their recommendations are set out under the acronym CARE: supporting Childcare, either onsite or at home through financial support; Accommodating families with family friendly dates, venues, and schedules; providing Resources, such as lactation, nursing, and baby-changing areas; and Establishing a conference-specific social network where parents and caregivers can schedule activities, organize babysitting and childcare swaps, share information, and provide emotional support for each other.<br/><br/>Making scientific conferences more family-friendly would send a message that the organizers recognize the challenges parent-scientists face, that working parents (especially working mothers) are valued, and that they want to encourage a diverse and thriving scientific workforce. The authors noted that their guidelines are applicable not only to conferences, but to workplace settings in general.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f7861d57807270176c500acfce200f2b"><name>social-mobility</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Symposium explores social mobility, student success</title><summary>In an effort to share the best means of supporting student success, UC Santa Cruz and CollegeNET hosted a symposium for educators across northern California.&#13;

<p>The Feb. 26 symposium included keynotes from CollegeNET CEO Jim Wolfston, UC Santa Cruz Professor Chris Benner, and UC Davis Professor Marco Molinaro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal for the symposium was to explore what we mean by &#8216;social mobility,&#8217; why it is important, and how social mobility is connected to educational equity,&#8221; said Jaye Padgett, vice provost for the Division of Student Success. &#8220;We explored what the data tells us about potential and actual best practices in student success, and explored ways we could use data to identify and reduce barriers.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz continues to attract a diverse student body and works hard to ensure a high-quality education is accessible for all Californians, regardless of family income. The symposium brought together higher education leaders to share and explore data-driven ways to ensure students are getting all the support they need as they pursue a degree and strive for social mobility.</p>
<p>Wolfston&#8217;s talk explored opportunities for reducing barriers to higher education and described CollegeNET&#8217;s <a href="http://www.socialmobilityindex.org">Social Mobility Index</a>, a data-driven analysis that ranks four-year colleges and universities according to how effective they are at enrolling students from low-income backgrounds and graduating them into good-paying jobs. UC Santa Cruz is among the top 25 universities on this index.</p>
<p>Benner presented an overview of the links between social equity and economic growth, and explored broad trends in higher education and the labor market. Molinaro shared his work understanding intersectionality and impacts on student success, and the ways UC Davis is engaging faculty in that process.</p>
<p>Seven-minute-long lightning talks featured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debra Griffith, associate vice president for Transition and Retention Services, San Jose State</li>
<li>Rebecca London, assistant professor, sociology, UC Santa Cruz</li>
<li>Pablo Reguer&#237;n, associate vice chancellor for Student Achievement and Equity Innovation, UC Santa Cruz</li>
<li>Rebecca Covarrubias, assistant professor, psychology, UC Santa Cruz</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;College education is now the most important rung on the ladder of economic mobility,&#8221; Wolfston said.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this year, donors did more than just reach the previous bar. They took the bar and flung it in the air. Breaking previous records, Giving Day 2018 yielded more than $600,000 with more than 6,300 gifts for 160 projects, according to preliminary tallies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We should all be proud&#160;of this&#160;day and the impact it will have on the campus,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Vice Chancellor for University Relations Keith Brant. &#8220;So many faculty, staff, students, and alumni are excited about this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day aims to nurture and expand UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s culture of philanthropy&#8212;and in that sense, the festival was a triumph of engagement, said Brant. &#8220;In terms of the total number of people engaged in our community at any one time, in one day, Giving Day is bigger than anything except for commencement.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><strong>Competitive fun</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third annual Giving Day used an appealing format to keep the gifts rolling in; the contest pitted teams of donors against one another in a good-natured sprint to the finish line, with the tension building as the clock wound down to the midnight deadline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donors and curious onlookers could look at the </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interactive and constantly updated Giving Day website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and track the results in real time. Every gift was tallied, ranging from online pledges to pocket change to beefy checks handed to team members in person at Quarry Plaza, where Giving Day participants set up booths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matches, created by donors, created strong incentives to give. &#8220;Challenges,&#8221; also funded by donors, pitted project teams against each other in a lighthearted way, creating bonuses for those that raised the most money in restricted time elements&#8212;from 5&#8211;7 p.m., for instance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many participants were new to Giving Day, a few of last year&#8217;s contest winners were back in action. For instance, Formula Slug,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a student-run, nonprofit sustainable engineering organization, specializing in student-designed electric race cars, performed very well last year, winning the Final Frenzy Challenge and a bonus $10,000. This year, they also sped to the finish line, winning the &#8220;Slug Surprise,&#8221; &#160;adding $5,000 to their project, which raised an impressive $17, 259.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://givingday.ucsc.edu/?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=19009&amp;t=1519376197"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gail Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which delves deeply into the history of the Pacific island of Okinawa, came out on top in terms of overall donations&#8212;367 of them, raising more than $21,000&#8212;making this organization one of Giving Day&#8217;s true &#8220;campaign heroes.&#8217;&#8217; The Gail Project organizes research trips to the island and has created exhibits on campus that have drawn hundreds of visitors. The project will use this bumper crop of donations to fund new internships and help pay for another trip this summer.</span></p>
<p>The top overall money-raiser was the Smith Society, which raised $37,000 towards a special fellowship to honor the memory of Calli Joy Morrow (College 10, '17), a Smith Collegiate Fellow who died on <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_148503421" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">January 13</span></span>. The fellowship will go towards one current Smith Collegiate Fellow, annually, who demonstrates a special interest in community service.</p>

The center uses community programming, events, and media to empower&#160;communities with the tools and insights of philosophy&#160;and the science of cognition to foster thoughtful dialogue. Among its projects is &#8220;Philosophy For Children&#8221; and a program that teaches the art of dialogue to inmates at San Quentin Prison. The Center for Public Philosophy also won the "Final Frenzy,'' winning $10,000 by attracting the largest number of invididual donors (no repeats) to support their project. <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>A wide array of causes</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, potential donors went from booth to booth at Quarry Plaza, checking out the various teams, writing checks, accepting informational brochures, and enjoying the wild assortment of free swag, ranging from decals and stickers to pre-wrapped Pacific Cookie Company treats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one Giving Day booth had a free offering so unusual and dramatic that it stopped many passersby in their tracks: &#160;&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Lori Siao, a graduate student in biomolecular engineering and bioinformatics, calling out to a group of students. &#8220;We are extracting DNA from strawberries! Are you interested?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strawberry experiments took place in a booth that raised money and awareness for </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/current-students/underrepresented-students/wise.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women In Science and Engineering (WiSE)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which encourages, nurtures, and advances </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">women in the STEM fields. The booth also raised awareness about the </span><a href="https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which supplies oncologists with genomic data that helps them choose targeted treatment options for young cancer patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently those strawberries enticed some serious gift-giving; WiSE ended up raising more than $4,000 on Giving Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere on the plaza, a group of young women raised funds for SOL, &#160;the UC Santa Cruz women&#8217;s ultimate frisbee team, enticing donors with cups of &#8216;bubble tea&#8221; for sale. Team member Manzanita Griffin (Kresge &#8217;18, business management/economics) was wistful about graduating this year. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be so sad!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll miss the environment, the community, and being around people who are just really open and friendly, but also competitive and loving life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she took comfort knowing she was raising money that would help create the same experience for other students, funding uniforms, everyday expenses, and travels to away games to colleges including Cal State Chico, UC Davis, and UC Santa Barbara. Sol raised a total of $6,315 with 19 donors contributing generously.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close by, in another section of the quad, Krishnan Nair (College 10 &#8217;20, computer science), was raising money and awareness for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Indian Student Association. Specifically, the money was going toward the Holi Festival, a colorful and energetic gathering that will take place at 2 p.m. April 13 on the OPERS East Field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I first came to UC Santa Cruz, I was the only Indian person on my floor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was really lacking in that Indian presence. ISA welcomed me with open arms. Now I&#8217;m on the executive board. This is a space for me to be around a culture that I missed.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><strong>Rewarding for projects and donors alike</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many projects reaped dividends in this year&#8217;s Giving Day, the process was also rewarding and invigorating for donors. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even certain alumni with a long and illustrious track record of giving to the campus could not resist taking part in the action this year. One prime example is Robert Holo (Crown &#8217;87, history, East Asian studies), a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee and donor. He, along with his wife, Christine (Oakes &#8217;90, biology), gave $1 million in 2012 to support the Center for Ocean Health at Long Marine Lab, a premier research facility for coastal conservation, policy, and research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holo found the ambition and the scope of the Giving Day projects enticing. &#8220;I was intrigued,&#8221; Holo said. &#8220;I know people spend a lot of time on Giving Day. I looked at the website and I thought, &#8216;This is really terrific.&#8217; There is a huge variety. You have student organizations, faculty organizations. I just thought it was great that there was something for everybody.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he was so impressed that he ended up giving to &#8220;a whole bunch&#8221; of projects&#8212;14 in all, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&#241;o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nuevo Island: Elephant Seals Project, Coastal Conservation Action Lab, the Predatory Bird Group Education Outreach Program, and Women in Science and Engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other Giving Day donors, Holo, known as a leading lawyer on federal income tax, &#160;loved the idea of paying it forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had been away from UC Santa Cruz for a period of time,&#8221; Holo said. &#8220;That&#8217;s when we stepped back and realized we had a great experience, we received a great education, frankly, at a bargain-basement price. We credit our education, in large part, to our success in life since then. We wanted to give back.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f8701344807270176c500acf00565d97"><name>sullivan-mellon-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus receives Mellon Foundation grant to help create new forms of digital publication</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is the lead institution on a $100,000 grant from The Andrew W.

Mellon Foundation and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) to help build a sustainable system for the digital publication and discovery of historical records. <br/><br/>The campus is one of eight winners nationally who have been awarded funds to design a cooperative infrastructure for publication, including digital repositories and discovery tools. The project team will discuss policies concerning rights and access, common use of linked open data standards, a possible system of shared governance, and a means of sustaining the work.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of history Elaine Sullivan will serve as the acting principal investigator of the grant, in collaboration with Angel D. Nieves of San Diego State University. &#160; &#160;<br/><br/>"This is a one-year planning grant, meant to bring members of a possible publishing collaborative together to think through what they might do to create new forms of digital publication for 'digital editions,'" Sullivan noted. <br/><br/>The grant&#160;brings together scholars working on 3D modeling/virtual environments to strategize the needs for publishing rich annotated content online. The project goal is to develop a plan to create a sustainable, open-source 3D digital-edition publishing cooperative that harnesses the knowledge and experience of scholars deeply engaged with the creation and dissemination of new forms of digital scholarship. <br/><br/>"Academic publishers, scholars with 3D content, digital librarians, technologists, and scholars will come together to&#160;identify and address the long-term challenges of preservation--and access--to a range of 3D content types, and to create new pathways to publication for scholars working with rich, layered&#160;3D scholarly materials," Sullivan added. <br/><br/>The Digital Edition Publishing Cooperatives Program was first announced in 2017 as a partnership between the Mellon Foundation and the NHPRC (the grant-making arm of the National Archives) to make historical records readily accessible to scholars, students, and the public.<br/><br/> "Assembling primary source evidence in critical scholarly editions is one of the humanities' most important contributions to our collective understanding of the world and its people," said Donald Waters, senior program officer at the Mellon Foundation.&#160;<br/><br/>"Since the early 1990s, scholars have used the digital medium to present these editions to the public, especially when the relevant evidence is in various formats, including texts, maps, audio, and still and moving images.&#160;With support from the eight grants in the&#160;Mellon-NHPRC&#160;Digital Edition Publishing Cooperatives Program, scholars will be collaborating to find common platforms, tools, procedures, and other economical means to be even more effective in creating and publishing critical editions of vital primary source evidence," he added.<br/><br/>Archivist of the United States David S. Ferriero noted, "At the National Archives, our very mission is to make records accessible.&#160; We are honored to be part of this project and delighted to join with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to help make our nation's historical records more widely available to anyone, anywhere, and at no cost.&#160; These cooperatives will explore technologies to revolutionize online historical research."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f8bd17e2807270176c500acf8355e395"><name>sap-video-updates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SAP update—landscape analysis available, register for workshop</title><summary>Register by March 15 to attend the all-campus Future State Design Workshop on Tuesday, March 20 in 108 DARC.</summary><start-date>1520323200000</start-date><display-name>Strategic academic planning</display-name><path>/2018/03/sap-video-updates</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/sap-video-updates</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1520296596404</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1520355685617</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><ul>

Davidson speaks to the crowd. </image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an effort to better prepare students for today&#8217;s complex and changing world, professor and author Cathy N. Davidson delivered a talk that chronicled the ways in which educators nation-wide are rethinking higher education and changing how and what is taught at universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;re being &#8216;traditional,&#8217; we&#8217;re not being traditional,&#8221; Davidson said. &#8220;People who say nothing has changed in higher education since Socrates walked the floor of the academy&#8212;no! Higher education went through massive, systematic, infrastructural, conceptual change for a historical contingency, which was the industrial age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davidson, the founding director of the Futures Initiative and a distinguished professor at the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY), was invited to speak at UC Santa Cruz by the <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</a> (CITL) for its annual convocation on March 1 at the University Center. The Humanities Teaching and Learning Now research cluster of UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/clusters/teaching-and-learning-in-the-humanities-now/">Humanities Institute</a> co-hosted the event. Davidson delivered a talk based on her latest book, <em>The New Education: How to Revolutionize the University to Prepare Students for a World in Flux</em>, which argues that our universities are based on an outdated and unequitable model, and pushes for a student-centered approach to education.</p>
<p>In a room full of rapt faculty members, undergraduate students, graduate students, staff, and campus leaders, Davidson offered a brief history of how Charles Eliot, the youngest and longest-serving president of Harvard University, set about to reform U.S. higher education to respond to the needs of the Industrial Age. She then argued that universities have failed to keep pace with the digital transformation that has reshaped the world.</p>
<p>Davidson noted that there have been many calls in the past decade to change higher education, but they&#8217;ve been rooted in someone&#8217;s desire to make more money, not to prepare students for the world. She first called out the &#8220;most pernicious&#8221; effort to &#8220;unbundle&#8221; education so that it focuses solely on job skills, opening up other areas for defunding.</p>
<p>Citing two studies by Google&#8212;<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-identify-what-makes-a-great-manager/steps/introduction/">Project Oxygen</a>, which focused what makes for a great manager, and <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/">Project Aristotle</a>, which looked at building a perfect team&#8212;Davidson underscored that technology skills are not as essential as cross-cultural communication, collaboration, supporting employees, offering a clear vision, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right in the belly of the beast, skills aren&#8217;t just tech skills,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;re also complex thinking, implementation, connection, and multicultural and multilingual skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offering examples of new approaches, Davidson cited the big thinking at the Georgetown University&#8217;s Red House, which is asking educators far-reaching questions: What forms of higher education are only possible now? What if a curriculum focused on a problem or issue and not a discipline?</p>
<p>In another example, Davidson discussed how the history department at Yale University decided to offer two majors&#8212;one for students hoping to become tenure-track faculty members and another general degree that placed all lessons in a global perspective and looked at what precipitated a particular historical event and what followed.</p>
<p>The result, she said, is that the university is finding ways to improve its professional major and that history is once again Yale&#8217;s most popular major&#8212;the first time since 2000.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens when you make change?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have to be a disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the significant and continuing impact of the internet, Davidson said higher education must do a better job of preparing students for a world that continues to evolve&#8212;calling it &#8220;defensive driving for a digital world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that almost every field at the university has something crucial to contribute to understanding a pretty fraught world we&#8217;re living in now,&#8221; Davidson said. &#8220;but very few disciplines have really thought &#8216;What are we are contributing to arm our students for the world we&#8217;ve foisted on them?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>CITL Director Jody Greene, a professor of literature, said the center distributed 150 copies of Davidson&#8217;s book to faculty across the academic divisions, which has started a cross-campus dialogue about what new approaches might&#8212;or might not&#8212;work at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Greene noted that Davidson&#8217;s work walks a fine line on the role of higher education&#8212;insisting on the need to equip students both with job skills and with the critical thinking skills to lead a thoughtful and meaningful life.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Cathy Davidson) sees the faculty of the university as the key changemakers when it comes to the most-needed transformations in higher education,&#8221; Greene said. "She is catalyzing a higher education revolution from below, which seems like a pretty good idea, given the painful record of top-down efforts to save this nation&#8217;s colleges and universities from an incipient mass extinction.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning was established in July 2016 to revitalize the university&#8217;s longstanding commitment to outstanding teaching. The CITL aims to provide support and resources for all who teach on campus, and especially focuses on the areas of inclusive teaching and teaching with technology.</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fd1a9e908072701777aa9bf8a29a8f89"><name>update-student-housing-west</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Housing West—What is happening now?</title><summary>By Sue Matthews, Associate Vice Chancellor, Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services — The campus is invited to attend open forums to learn more about Student Housing West. </summary><start-date>1520323200000</start-date><display-name>Student Housing West</display-name><path>/2018/03/update-student-housing-west</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/update-student-housing-west</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1520369834577</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1522182539930</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sue Matthews</name><title>Associate Vice Chancellor, Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services</title><phone/><email>sdmatthe@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/housing-sites-aerial-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/housing-sites-aerial-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>housing-sites-aerial-500px.jpg</name><display-name>housing-sites-aerial-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>378971</file-size><width>500</width><height>355</height></image><image-alt>Sites of Student Housing West</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Student Housing West will be developed across two on-campus sites.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As progress on the development of <a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/housing/studenthousingwest/index.html">Student Housing West</a> continues, we are eager to share with the campus community the latest milestones achieved and next steps ahead.</p>

<p>Over the course of the last few weeks, nearly 3,400 students participated in an online housing demand study administered by Brailsford and Dunlavey, the firm which also conducted our 2014 demand study. We are eager to receive and delve into the findings.</p>
<p><a href="../../2017/10/update-student-housing-west.xml">As shared previously</a>, Student Housing West will be developed across two on-campus sites. The Heller site, where Family Student Housing (FSH) is currently located, will serve as the location for upper-division undergraduate and graduate student housing. The Hagar site will be the new home for Family Student Housing and will also include the <a href="../../2017/05/childcare-services-employee-housing.xml">expanded child care facility</a>, serving up to 140 children of our students, faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>In order to achieve our goal of bringing on new student housing as expeditiously as possible, development on the Hagar site will be the first to commence beginning this summer 2018, with an anticipated occupancy date of fall 2019. The draft EIR for this project will be released late March and will have a 45 day comment period. Family Student Housing tenants will remain in their current residences until the new units are ready, at which time work on the existing FSH site will commence in earnest.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the new FSH development on the Hagar site, the new child care facility will be developed simultaneously with the goal of also opening in fall 2019. Until that time, the existing Early Education Services program serving the children of our students will continue to remain in operation. In summer 2017, a <a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/housing/studenthousingwest/child-care-center.html">multi-constituent workgroup</a> consisting of students, faculty and staff proposed the child care program needs and desires for this new facility.

Led by sophomore Paul Colosi and freshman Nick Kleiber, among others, the Banana Slugs finished second at the West Regional, placed 26th in the nation, and later swept the end-of-season awards handed out by the Association of the Division III Independents.</p>
<p>Replicating that sort of team success this spring in track and field won&#8217;t be easy, of course, if it happens at all. Individuals qualify to the national championships in track&#8212;not teams, like in cross country&#8212;and making it that far has not been a level reached by any Slug in program history.</p>
<p>But the effect the cross country team&#8217;s exceptional fall campaign is having on the track program this spring should not be ignored. Motivation remains high among the returning harriers who competed at the national championships just three months ago, while the accomplishment is inspiring others and providing a level of success the track program hopes to reach in the near future.</p>
<p>UC Santa began its 2018 track and field campaign at the Kim Duyst Invitational in Turlock. The team will compete in the Hornet Invitational at Sacramento State on March 16&#8211;17.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very exciting, to have a group qualify to the NCAA&#8217;s (for cross country). In terms of track and field, there was definitely an excitement among the men and women,&#8221; said first-year track coach David Klech, who in the fall coached the Slugs&#8217; cross country team and was named Coach of the Year by AD3I. A two-time All-American at the University of Oregon, where he later coached, Klech was an assistant under UC Santa Cruz head coach Jamey Harris last season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really trying to set up a competitive program on the West Coast,&#8221; Klech said.</p>
<p>Excitement surrounds the program as it continues to grow. While the women are in their seventh year of competition, Klech said, this is just the third for the men. And last year was the first year UCSC competed in every event&#8212;with the lone exception being women&#8217;s heptathlon, Klech said.</p>
<p>An impressive crop of freshmen will look to lead the Slugs&#8217; continued development. Victoria Mitchell (Bentonville High/Bentonville, Ark.) joins the Slugs after winning an Arkansas state title in the 800 meters as a high school junior, while newcomer Abby McPhillips (Oak Park High/Oak Park, Calif.) qualified to the prestigious California state meet in the high jump as a sophomore.</p>
<p>On the men&#8217;s side, freshman Conrad Pereira (Chantilly High/Fairfax, Va.) last year competed in his high school state championship in both the high jump and 4x400. He is expected to compete in the sprint events as well as the high jump, long jump, and triple jump, Klech said. Mason Pierce (Colfax High/Meadow Vista, Calif.), meanwhile, advanced to the California state meet last year in the pole vault.</p>
<p>Pierce cleared 15 feet, 6 inches to qualify for the state meet, tying a Colfax High School record, according to the Colfax Record.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s another very good recruit. He&#8217;s exceptional in the pole vault,&#8221; Colosi, a team captain, said of Pierce.</p>
<p>Colosi, who in the fall was named Male Runner of the Year by the AD3I for the second year in a row, said also freshmen Kleiber (Oakland Tech/Oakland, Calif.) and Kellen O&#8217;Neill (Arcata High/Arcata, Calif.) have been standouts. Both were members of the Slugs&#8217; cross country team, with Kleiber earning top frosh honors.</p>
<p>&#8220;They both had impressive cross country seasons and we&#8217;re excited for what that holds in track season,&#8221; Klech said.</p>
<p>Cross-country runners make up roughly half the athletes competing for the track and field program, so their prior success bodes well as they transfer to events like the 800 and 1,500 meters, the 5 and 10 kilometers, and the 3-kilometer steeplechase.</p>
<p>Colosi (St. Francis High/Corralitos, Calif.) said the cross country team&#8217;s solid season helped runners stay motivated through winter break, some of whom returned in better shape. Colosi is expected to make an impact in the middle- to long-distance events, alongside Kleiber, O&#8217;Neill, and fellow harriers Draven Hawk (Scotts Valley High/Scotts Valley, Calif.) and Dante Capone (Analy High/Sebastopol, Calif.).</p>
<p>&#8220;It does carry over, in the sense that we built up a lot of fitness during cross country,&#8221; Colosi said. &#8220;With cross country, everything builds on itself. Your freshman year of cross country builds into freshman track. Your sophomore year of cross country builds into sophomore track. By senior year, you can build upon all the miles from seasons prior.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re running really well right now due to the success we had in cross country. It&#8217;s a good springboard into track.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that vein, sophomore Raymond Breault (St. Ignatius Prep/Brisbane, Calif.) showed significant improvement during cross country season, Klech said, and is looking to continue that trend in the 800. The head coach felt similarly with the performance of sophomore Tyler Rule (Huntington Beach High/Huntington Beach, Calif.), who is expected to compete in the steeplechase.</p>
<p>Senior Davis Kepon (Foothill High/Redding, Calif.) and junior transfer Brandon Nicely (Bonita High/La Verne, Calif.) will provide depth in the sprints and hurdles, respectively. Both will compete in the multi-events.</p>
<p>Kepon, who last season was strong in the high jump and javelin for UCSC, will be making his decathlon debut, while Nicely will look to build upon his 2017 campaign in which he placed sixth in the event at the California Community College Athletic Association Track and Field Championships.</p>
<p>Nicely is a transfer from Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, Calif.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ve definitely come a long way, in terms of developing (the program) and reaching out to more people who specialize in different events,&#8221; said junior Sydney Gutierrez, who garnered Female Runner of the Year honors during cross country season.</p>
<p>During her freshman year, Gutierrez (Lowell High/San Francisco) recalls the team having only one sprinter. Depth is less of an issue now.</p>
<p>Klech is expecting impressive times&#8212;and distances&#8212;from sophomore Siena Benavides (Arvin High/Arvin, Calif.), who set personal records in both the 100 meters and long jump at last year&#8217;s West Coast Last Chance in San Francisco. Klech said junior Natalie Marquardt (Morro Bay High/Morro Bay, Calif.) transitioned from the middle distances last season to both the 200 and 400, a changeover junior Nancy Alvarado-Zavaleta (Garfield High/Los Angeles) will be tasked with this season.</p>
<p>McPhillips, the state qualifier in the high jump, is also a good sprinter, Klech said, while freshman Melanie Wong (Irvington High/Fremont, Calif.) joins the Slugs following an extensive high school career in the hurdles.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;re excited to see what she can do as a Slug,&#8221; Klech said of Wong.</p>
<p>Sophomore Jordynn Dorado (Nipomo High/Nipomo, Calif.) is a name to watch this season. A year ago the then-freshman was ranked in the top 15 in the West Region in the shot put, discus, and hammer throw.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she had a tremendous offseason,&#8221; Klech said.</p>
<p>Like the men, the women&#8217;s middle- to long-distance runners enter the season already warmed up. Gutierrez will try and use her successful cross country campaign to shine in the 800 and 1,500 meters. She said the success of the men&#8217;s cross country team has pushed her to work harder.</p>
<p>&#8220;It definitely drives me, to want to be better,&#8221; Gutierrez said. &#8220;And work harder. The idea is in my head and the other girls as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fellow harriers Allie Lourim (St. Francis High/Sacramento) and Abby Klein (West Torrance High/Torrance, Calif.) will provide depth in the distance events, while freshman Carrie Bradley (Tahoe-Truckee High/Truckee, Calif.) will try and earn accolades in the 1,500 and 5,000.</p>
<p>Bradley was named Rookie of the Year by AD3I in the fall. Gutierrez hopes that season is a sign of things to come at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they were able to take their running ability so far,&#8221; Gutierrez said of the men&#8217;s cross country team, &#8220;I think it shows how promising the whole program could be.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="07023f488072701777aa9bf8195100e4"><name>rsv-antibodies</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Antigen study supports new approach to vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus</title><summary>RSV causes serious respiratory disease in infants and older adults, but past efforts to develop a vaccine have met with frustration and disappointment.</summary><keywords>Rebecca DuBois, RSV vaccine</keywords><start-date>1520622000000</start-date><display-name>Antigen study supports new approach to vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus</display-name><path>/2018/03/rsv-antibodies</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/rsv-antibodies</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1520536009358</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1520621875082</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/rsv-antibodies-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/rsv-antibodies-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rsv-antibodies-410.jpg</name><display-name>rsv-antibodies-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>82718</file-size><width>410</width><height>492</height></image><image-alt>RSV antigen and antibody</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/rsv-antibodies-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/rsv-antibodies-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rsv-antibodies-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>rsv-antibodies-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19354</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>RSV antigen and antibody</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Immune system antibodies can block RSV infection and provide protection from RSV disease.

New findings by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, however, point to a promising route for designing an effective vaccine.</p>
<p>For most people, an RSV infection is just a bad cold, but for infants and older adults it can cause serious pneumonia or bronchial inflammation. In the 1960s, a traditional vaccine based on inactivated virus was found to actually make the disease worse. More recently, clinical trials of two different vaccines based on one of the viral surface proteins (the RSV F glycoprotein) have also failed.</p>
<p>The new study, published March 9 in <em>Science Immunology</em>, focused on the other major viral surface protein, the RSV G glycoprotein. Leveraging work by collaborators at Trellis Bioscience who have isolated protective human antibodies targeting the G glycoprotein, the UCSC researchers determined the atomic structure of RSV G and identified two sites on it that are targeted by protective antibodies effective against a broad range of RSV strains.</p>
<p>Corresponding author Rebecca DuBois, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, said RSV G had been overlooked by vaccine researchers because initial studies found that deleting the gene for it didn't stop the virus from replicating in cell cultures. Studies in animal models, however, showed that virus lacking the G glycoprotein is significantly weakened.</p>
<p>"The G glycoprotein is actually very important," DuBois said. "It's the attachment protein that allows the virus to stick to lung cells, while the F glycoprotein promotes entry into the cell. Once the virus infects a cell and starts replicating, it makes a secreted form of the G glycoprotein that goes out and starts flipping switches on our immune cells, distorting our immune responses."</p>
<p>This disruption of the immune response by RSV G may explain why vaccines based on RSV F have failed, she said. "You need a protective antibody response that blocks that RSV G activity, but we didn't know how antibodies target RSV G at the molecular level."</p>
<p><strong>Conserved domain</strong></p>
<p>In the new study, DuBois showed that these protective antibodies target a section of the protein called the central conserved domain that is the same in all strains of the virus. The researchers determined the three-dimensional atomic structures of the precise binding sites of two Trellis antibodies--crucial information for designing a vaccine that can induce the immune system to produce such protective antibodies.</p>
<p>"We're really excited about the possibility of finally being able to conquer this virus, which is one of the most important childhood viruses for which we don't have a vaccine," DuBois said.</p>
<p>In developing a vaccine based on RSV G, however, researchers would have to ensure that the vaccine lacks the viral protein's ability to disrupt the immune system. "There has been a lot of concern about making a vaccine with the G glycoprotein. We need to engineer it so that it can't subvert the immune system, while keeping its ability to elicit an effective antibody response," DuBois said.</p>
<p>Trellis Bioscience, meanwhile, is investigating the therapeutic use of the antibodies themselves to treat infants with RSV infection and severe lung congestion, with clinical trials expected to start in early 2019. If proven effective, the demand for a vaccine that elicits protective antibodies targeting the G glycoprotein will intensify, particularly for global use, DuBois said</p>
<p>The first author of the paper is UC Santa Cruz graduate student Stanislav Fedechkin. Other coauthors include Natasha George and Jacob Wolff, both undergraduate researchers in DuBois's lab at the time of the study, and Lawrence Kauvar of Trellis Bioscience. This research was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="07e074b98072701777aa9bf8b7c4e709"><name>se-library</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grant to transform upper floor of Science and Engineering Library</title><summary>A $5 million grant will kick-start the Science and Engineering Library’s transformation and name floor to honor legendary astrophysicist Sandra Faber</summary><start-date>1520496000000</start-date><display-name>Library renovation</display-name><path>/2018/03/se-library</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/se-library</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1520550572085</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1521584548916</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/sandy-elizabeth-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/sandy-elizabeth-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandy-elizabeth-500px.jpg</name><display-name>sandy-elizabeth-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>431409</file-size><width>500</width><height>736</height></image><image-alt>Librarian Elizabeth Cowell and Professor Sandy Faber</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/sandy-elizabeth-square-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/sandy-elizabeth-square-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sandy-elizabeth-square-80px.jpg</name><display-name>sandy-elizabeth-square-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17043</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Librarian Elizabeth Cowell and Professor Sandy Faber</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell, left, and Professor Emerita Sandy Faber.

<p>&#8220;The library&#8212;a repository of knowledge&#8212;remains fundamental to the mission of our university, yet it must evolve to meet the needs of today&#8217;s world of inquiry,&#8221; Chancellor George Blumenthal said. &#8220;This grant helps to launch an important reimagining of our Science and Engineering Library that will ensure its central place in our campus for the decades to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The re-envisioning of the Science and Engineering Library will be completed in phases, starting with the top floor. The grant, from a foundation that wished to remain anonymous, will transform the physical experience of that space in ways that will support and inspire students.</p>
<p>The top floor of the Science and Engineering Library will be named in honor of Sandra M. Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Faber&#8217;s work has helped establish many of the foundational principles underlying the modern understanding of the universe on the largest scales.</p>
<p>Faber, who received the National Medal of Science in 2013, is renowned for her contributions to the understanding of dark matter, galaxy formation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wonderful honor to be remembered in a project that will help the campus in so many ways. Science Hill has long needed a social focal point where students and faculty can gather,&#8221; Faber said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this long-term vision in mind, I am sure that putting food, scholarly resources, and bright people together into one of our architectural gems will spark new learning and exciting new initiatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Science and Engineering Library opened in 1991. Since then, the size of campus and the science and engineering community has more than doubled. The library, as it is currently configured, is not optimized to serve the needs of 21st-century researchers and learners.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Science and Engineering Library we envision for the 21st century is both a research hub and a center for student success,&#8221; said Elizabeth Cowell, the Richard L. Press University Librarian, Presidential Chair. &#8220;We are building a library for and around a supportive community of our growing diverse student population. We are not just refurbishing a 25 year old building.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our library will be holistic and proactive,&#8221; Cowell said, &#8220;with infrastructure and services that aim to connect people and ideas from all backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Science &amp; Engineering Library Advisory Task Force, charged by Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp and University Librarian Cowell, is expected to offer recommendations by the end of winter quarter on how the Science and Engineering Library can best support student success in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</p>
<p>The renovation, which will be donor-funded, aims to expand the library&#8217;s capacity to provide support for more students and faculty.</p>
<p>Like with the McHenry Library renovation in 2011, the campus also plans to add a cafe in the Science and Engineering Library&#8217;s lower level and increase the number of group study rooms available for reservation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="08c3e0a58072701777aa9bf8409393b8"><name>yang-film-screening</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'And Then They Came for Us' brings history into the present</title><summary>The Humanities Institute and Cowell College will present a special screening of "And Then They Came for Us," winner of the Accolade Global Film 2017 Humanitarian Award, on March 14 at the Del Mar Theater in downtown Santa Cruz.&#13;

<p>Winner of the&#160;<strong><em><a href="http://accoladecompetition.org/humanitarian-award/humanitarian-award-winners-2017/">Accolade Global Film 2017 Humanitarian Award</a></em></strong>, the film recounts how 75 years ago,&#160;Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#8217;s Executive Order 9066 during World War II began the process of violating the constitutional rights of 120,000 Japanese Americans--resulting in their mass removal from the West Coast and incarceration behind barbed wire.</p>
<p>Featuring rediscovered photographs by Dorothea Lange, <em>And Then They Came For Us</em> connects history with the present, by retelling this story and then showing Japanese American activists speaking out today against a Muslim registry and travel ban.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>After the screening, a panel discussion will take place featuring&#160;the film&#8217;s co-producer and co-director <strong>Abby Ginzberg</strong>, who has won numerous awards for her documentaries on race and social justice issues.</p>
<p>It will also include <strong>Donald Tamaki</strong>--a lawyer who served on the pro bono team that reopened the landmark Supreme Court case of Korematsu v. the United States, overturning Fred Korematsu&#8217;s conviction for refusing as an American citizen to be incarcerated on account of his racial ancestry; and <strong>Ammad Rafiqi</strong>, a civil rights attorney with the Council on American Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The audience will hear about how the film has inspired activists around the country, Donald Tamaki&#8217;s work on an amicus curiae brief opposing the Trump travel ban, and Ammad Rafiqi&#8217;s work helping victims of hate crimes,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz history professor and Stevenson provost Alice Yang, who will serve as moderator for the panel.</p>
<p>Yang added that she hopes the film will help attendees learn about the power of activism--both in the past and the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took decades for many Japanese Americans to resurrect painful memories about the World War II incarceration,&#8221; Yang noted. &#8220;Many of these activists credited the civil rights and ethnic pride movements with encouraging them to fight for redress that led to the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 that provided a national apology, individual compensation of $20,000, and the creation of an educational fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The commitment and dedication of these activists, including many who are now in their 80s and 90s, is truly inspiring and shows the power of coalition-building to confront discrimination, defend democracy, and prevent historical injustices from being repeated,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>This event is part of The Humanities Institute&#8217;s <em>Freedom and Race Series</em>.</p>

Four different classes of toxins, including one produced in freshwater environments, occur regularly throughout the bay, according to a study led by UC Santa Cruz researchers and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568988318300258">published March 10 in <em>Harmful Algae</em></a>.</p>
<p>"The bay is acting as a big mixing bowl where toxins from both fresh and marine water are found together," said senior author Raphael Kudela, the Lynn Professor of Ocean Health at UC Santa Cruz. "A big concern is that we don't know what happens if someone is exposed to multiple toxins at the same time."</p>
<p>Although shellfish on the open coast are routinely monitored for some of these toxins, the toxins and contamination levels in shellfish from San Francisco Bay may be very different from what's found on the open coast, he said. The researchers found that 99 percent of mussels collected from the bay were contaminated with at least one algal toxin, and 37 percent contained four distinct kinds of toxins. The contamination greatly exceeded regulatory guidelines for multiple toxins in 2012, 2014, and 2015.</p>
<p>Eating contaminated mussels can have serious health effects for humans and wildlife. Although there are no commercial shellfish operations in San Francisco Bay, some people do harvest mussels from the bay for their own consumption.</p>
<p>"At first we thought no one eats shellfish out of San Francisco Bay, but in fact you can go online and find blogs talking about the best places to collect mussels, and some of those are the places where we found the highest toxin levels," Kudela said. "I don't know how widespread it is, but I wouldn't recommend harvesting shellfish from the bay, even if you're following the state quarantine guidelines, because the state only monitors the open coast."</p>
<p>Mussels in the bay were contaminated with the following toxins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domoic acid</strong>, a neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans, is produced by marine diatoms in the genus <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Paralytic shellfish toxins</strong> (saxitoxins), which cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, are associated with marine dinoflagellates in the genus <em>Alexandrium</em>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Dinophysis</em></strong><strong> shellfish toxins</strong> (okadaic acid and derivatives) cause diarrhetic shellfish poisoning and are produced by marine dinoflagellates in the genus <em>Dinophysis</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Microcystins</strong>, produced by freshwater cyanobacteria in the genus <em>Microcystis</em>, are hepatotoxins that cause liver damage in people and animals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mussel samples often exceeded recommended guidelines for human consumption for both microcystins and <em>Dinophysis</em> shellfish toxins. Levels of domoic acid and paralytic shellfish toxins were lower than the regulatory limits, but Kudela noted that some studies suggest chronic exposure to even low levels of these toxins may cause neurological impairments. "Also, this was a fairly small study, so there may be bigger peaks than the levels we saw," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring programs</strong></p>
<p>Kudela, a leading expert on harmful algal blooms, works closely with state and federal agencies, and he said several agencies are considering changes to their monitoring programs in light of these new findings. The evidence of widespread contamination of the bay with microcystins from freshwater sources, for example, has caught the attention of inland water agencies and led to increased efforts to identify the sources.</p>
<p>"In these boundary areas like San Francisco Bay, it's not always clear which agency is responsible. We need to look at coastal areas more holistically so we don't end up with a regulatory gray area where nobody's monitoring the shellfish but people are still eating them," Kudela said.</p>
<p>He noted that commercially harvested shellfish are generally safe because they undergo regular testing. But neither microcystins nor <em>Dinophysis</em> shellfish toxins have been included in the routine monitoring of California shellfish.</p>
<p>The study began in 2011 when Kudela's lab started monitoring for domoic acid and microcystins in the water during regular water quality surveys conducted in San Francisco Bay by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). When those surveys revealed both toxins were occurring throughout the bay, they began testing shellfish and looking for all four toxins.</p>
<p>"This is the first time we've found all four of those toxins, including both freshwater and marine toxins, in the same mussel samples," Kudela said.</p>
<p>The study coincided with a major drought in California, but how that may have influenced the findings is not clear. "Drought potentially brought some of the marine toxins further into the bay because there was less river flow, and it probably intensified the freshwater toxins," Kudela said. "We don't think the toxins were only there because of the drought, but it could have amplified things."</p>
<p>The authors of the study include first author Melissa Peacock, a former graduate student and postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz who is now at Northwest Indian College in Bellingham, Washington; former UCSC graduate student Corinne Gibble, now at California Department of Fish and Wildlife; SFEI researcher David Senn, lead scientist for the San Francisco Bay Nutrient Management Strategy; and USGS researcher James Cloern. This research was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the San Francisco Bay Nutrient Management Strategy, with additional support from USGS.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1bd45c1b8072701777aa9bf86cf49540"><name>keynote-brandt</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Silicon Valley Campus raising profile</title><summary>By Scott Brandt, Vice Chancellor, Office of Research — The role of UC Santa Cruz in Silicon Valley—an extension of our mission of education, research, and service—is focused on four key areas.</summary><start-date>1520924400000</start-date><display-name>Silicon Valley Campus</display-name><path>/2018/03/keynote-brandt</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/keynote-brandt</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1520885323722</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1522182359383</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Brandt</name><title>Vice Chancellor, Office of Research</title><phone/><email>sbrandt@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/brandt-scott-350px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/brandt-scott-350px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brandt-scott-350px.jpg</name><display-name>brandt-scott-350px.jpg</display-name><file-size>163241</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt>Vice Chancellor Brandt</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/brandt-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/brandt-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brandt-80px.jpg</name><display-name>brandt-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>13559</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Vice Chancellor Brandt</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Eighteen months ago, a robot cut the ribbon on the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu">Silicon Valley Campus</a>, marking a new era for our leadership in this global hub of innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Our role in Silicon Valley&#8212;an extension of our mission of education, research, and service&#8212;is focused on four key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>offering professional master&#8217;s programs designed to support the diverse workforce in the region;</li>
<li>supporting campus innovation and entrepreneurship;</li>
<li>supporting UCSC Silicon Valley Extension in providing top-notch professional training; and</li>
<li>providing a space for campus events and those from the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the principal officer for the Silicon Valley Campus, it has been rewarding to see UC Santa Cruz succeed on all of these fronts. We are on track to need additional space in the coming years to support all of our endeavors there.</p>
<p>Some of the most exciting work, of course, is connected to the exceptional academic programming we&#8217;re offering. The Silicon Valley Campus is home to our <a href="https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu">Games and Playable Media program</a>, one of the top-ranked programs of its kind in the world. This masters degree program offers students an intensive, real-world experience, augmented by deep and frequent industry interactions enabled by the program&#8217;s Silicon Valley location and veteran faculty. In the past year alone, more than 50 members of the interactive entertainment industry have visited the Games and Playable Media students. Alumni have gone on to launch acclaimed games and join major gaming companies, such as Naughty Dog (Sony), Activision, and Wargaming.net.</p>
<p>This is just our start. This fall, we anticipate launching a professional master&#8217;s program in Serious Games, which harnesses the rich experience of gaming and channels it into education, training, advocacy, and other applications beyond entertainment. This program will formalize and expand work already being done in the Games and Playable Media program such as <em>Peace and Order</em>, a virtual reality game by GPM student Chelsea Manzano which explores the human consequences of the drug war in the Philippines. The Silicon Valley Campus will serve as the home base for four new faculty members in the Baskin School of Engineering who will join these two programs.</p>
<p>Additional programs under development include Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing. Each program is expected to educate up to 60 graduate students.</p>
<p>The campus is also home to the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/ogawa-datatrust.html">Silicon Valley Regional Data Trust</a>, a project by Sociologist Rebecca London and Professor Emeritus Rod Ogawa that will enable teachers, principals, social workers, public and mental health professionals, judges, and probation officers to share information in real time about students and the services they are receiving.</p>
<p>Many of you probably read about <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/sv-link.html">SVLink</a>, our new incubator and accelerator in Silicon Valley that will support UC Santa Cruz innovators, as well as those from other UCs or the general public. The goal is to ensure that our cutting-edge research and the technologies and ideas created continue to serve Californians. SVLink will provide a convenient way for startups to secure the space and support needed to launch their product.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ucsc-extension.edu">UCSC Silicon Valley Extension</a> has three major enterprises: UC Extension certificate programs, Smarter Balanced, and UC Scout.</p>
<p>For more than 50 years, UCSC Extension has offered accredited certificate programs to ensure professionals stay competitive in the rapidly changing workforce and employers have the skilled workers they need. Serving about 15,000 students annually, Extension offers courses, certificate programs, skills badges, and continuing education in 36 disciplines in the high demand areas of engineering, technology, biosciences, education, design, and business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ucscout.org">UC Scout</a> provides online college preparation and advanced placement courses, serving thousands of students in California and around the world who might not otherwise have access to courses they need for college admission.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smarterbalanced.org">Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium</a> serves 7 million K&#8211;12 students nationally using computer adaptive technology to provide standardized assessments that are ADA-compliant and available to English language learners and special needs students.</p>
<p>Finally, the Silicon Valley Campus event space has served as a venue for public talks by our brilliant faculty, such as the <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/kraw-lecture/">Kraw Lecture Series</a>, a variety of UC-wide meetings, and gatherings hosted by local leaders. We are currently averaging a major event every week and will soon see the day when we&#8217;ll have to turn people away.</p>
<p>The visibility and importance of UC Santa Cruz in Silicon Valley has never been greater&#8212;and we&#8217;re just getting started.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1c1eac728072701777aa9bf85e830964"><name>nexties</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz prof and grad student are among honorees at 2018 NEXTies</title><summary>The local awards show will be held at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz on Friday, March 23.</summary><keywords>John Felts, Ryan Foley</keywords><start-date>1520924400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz prof and grad student are among honorees at 2018 NEXTies</display-name><path>/2018/03/nexties</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/nexties</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1520890193984</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1520952429157</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/ryan-foley-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/ryan-foley-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ryan-foley-250.jpg</name><display-name>ryan-foley-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>82446</file-size><width>250</width><height>280</height></image><image-alt>Ryan Foley</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/nexties-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/nexties-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nexties-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nexties-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18311</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>nexties logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Ryan Foley</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/john-felts-crop.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/john-felts-crop.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>john-felts-crop.jpg</name><display-name>john-felts-crop.jpg</display-name><file-size>29592</file-size><width>196</width><height>218</height></image><image-alt>John Felts</image-alt><image-caption>John Felts</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Local awards show will be held at the Rio Theater on Friday, March 23</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will be well represented at the 2018 NEXTies, the local awards show celebrating the best and brightest in the Santa Cruz community. The annual event will be held Friday, March 23, at 6 p.m. at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Among the honorees will be UCSC graduate student John Felts ("Innovator of the Year") and astronomer Ryan Foley ("Wildcard"). The annual NEXTies event spotlights local talent in industries ranging from the arts and technology to fitness and food.</p>
<p>Felts, a graduate student in electrical engineering, is CEO and cofounder of <a href="https://www.cruzfoam.com/">Cruz Foam</a>, a startup company developing a biodegradable alternative to the polyurethane and polystyrene foam used in surfboards. Working with cofounders Marco Rolandi, associate professor of electrical engineering, and graduate student Xiaolin Zhang, Felts developed a way to use chitin, a natural polymer found in shrimp shells, to make a sustainable foam product. Their company is currently part of the UCSC-supported technology accelerator Santa Cruz Accelerates run by Santa Cruz Works.</p>
<p>Foley, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics, led a small team that was the first to observe the light from a neutron star merger on August 17, 2017, a spectacular event that galvanized the international astronomy community. Gravitational waves from this cosmic collision were detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). The observations by Foley's team and others enabled scientists to study for the first time both the gravitational waves (ripples in the fabric of space-time) and the radiation emitted from the violent merger of the densest objects in the universe.</p>

White, professor emeritus in the History of Consciousness Department at UC Santa Cruz, died at his Santa Cruz home on March 5, 2018, at age 89. He was a 40-year resident of Santa Cruz who traveled the world.<br/><br/>White was trained as a medieval historian, but the majority of his work focused on modern European intellectual history, literary criticism, philosophy, and historiography--the study of historical writing.<br/><br/>He first gained notice in 1966 with an essay, &#8220;The Burden of History,&#8221; laying the foundation for his later work, which re-imagined history as a creative, as well as scientific history. His landmark book published in 1973, <em>Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe</em>, initiated a major re-orientation in the field of historiography and has been translated into more than 10 languages.<br/><br/>"Hayden White was a towering figure bridging intellectual history and cultural theory,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz dean of humanities, Tyler Stovall.&#160;&#8220;His <em>Metahistory</em> remains one of the most important studies of historiography in the modern era. His focus on narrative and the relationship between history and literature exercised a seminal influence on the rise of cultural history to its dominant position in historical studies today."<br/><br/>Stovall added that White also &#8220;played a central role in shaping the History of Consciousness Department into a one-of-a-kind program that pioneered theoretical and cultural studies, and helped stamp UC Santa Cruz as a university that marched to a different drummer."&#160;<br/><br/>White came to UC Santa Cruz in 1978 as one of the History of Consciousness Board&#8217;s first full-time faculty members. As the new chairperson, he brought &#8220;essential stability and a fresh vision,&#8221; recalled his colleague, emeritus professor James Clifford. &#8220;Working with Hayden wasn&#8217;t always comfortable. He would step on what you held sacred. And he could be wickedly accurate. But we discovered that if you stayed with him, stayed in the conversation (and he so loved conversation), he would do anything for you. Watching him work with students, I was always amazed by how much he took on, how generous he could be. An incredible energy&#8230;&#8221;<br/><br/>Born on July 12, 1928, in Martin, Tennessee, White enlisted in the Navy near the end of WWII and used his G.I. bill after the war to begin his academic career. He earned a B.A. in History in 1951 from Wayne State University in Detroit, and his M.A. degree from the University of Michigan in 1952.&#160;He also spent two years in Rome, Italy, on a Fulbright Fellowship, where he completed his dissertation research in the Vatican library on Church Reform in the Middle Ages, and received his Ph.D. in History from the University of Michigan in 1956.<br/><br/>White also held teaching positions at Wayne State University, the University of Rochester New York, UCLA, Wesleyan University, UC Berkeley, and Stanford University. Among his many awards, and honors, he was an elected Fellow to the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. <br/> <br/>His final book, <em>The Practical Past</em> (2014), opened a new way of historical thinking outside the professional norms, insisting that history is a set of practical pre-suppositions accessible by rhetorical and literary means, which constitutes the ethical foundation of our daily existence. <br/><br/>&#8220;Hayden White&#8217;s career was animated by the fear that we were becoming prisoners of our histories, individual and collective,&#8221; noted Wlad Godzich, distinguished professor of literature and former dean of humanities at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;He saw his task as liberating us from the burden of history and from the endlessly divisive quest for some authenticity to be found in the past.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Hayden was an optimist who believed that imagination could help us design better futures,&#8221; Godzich added. &#8220;He was also a realist who denounced the flaws of the present and the past, and warned us against dangerous futures. He was a great humanist who harnessed the resources of literature, philosophy, and history to provide a sustainable future for humankind. These were the animating concerns of the department of the History of Consciousness, which he put on the world map of learning.&#8221; <br/><br/>White is survived by his wife of 46 years, Margaret Brose; children Juliana Sarah Brose White, Adam Virgil White and David H. White; and grandson David Ross White.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="200204498072701777aa9bf827560a82"><name>number-theory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Textbook on number theory acclaimed for its novel approach</title><summary>Mathematics professor Martin Weissman's new book has received an honorable mention in the 2018 PROSE Awards and raves from fellow mathematicians.</summary><keywords>An Illustrated Theory of Numbers, Martin Weissman</keywords><start-date>1521010800000</start-date><display-name>Textbook on number theory acclaimed for its novel approach</display-name><path>/2018/03/number-theory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/number-theory</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1520955424767</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1521043099378</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Publications</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/cover-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/cover-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-300.jpg</name><display-name>cover-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>48849</file-size><width>300</width><height>429</height></image><image-alt>textbook cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/martin-weissman-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/martin-weissman-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>martin-weissman-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>martin-weissman-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16749</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Martin Weissman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/martin-weissman.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/martin-weissman.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>martin-weissman.jpg</name><display-name>martin-weissman.jpg</display-name><file-size>19035</file-size><width>180</width><height>223</height></image><image-alt>Martin Weissman</image-alt><image-caption>Martin Weissman</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Mathematics professor Martin Weissman's new book has received an honorable mention in the 2018 PROSE Awards and raves from fellow mathematicians</article-subhead><article-text><p>It's not often that a mathematics textbook is described as "gorgeous" or "a work of practical art." But <a href="http://illustratedtheoryofnumbers.com/"><em>An Illustrated Theory of Numbers</em></a> by Martin Weissman, associate professor of mathematics at UC Santa Cruz, is no ordinary textbook.</p>
<p>Weissman said his interest in design and information visualization inspired him to produce a "super-illustrated" book on number theory, a topic he has taught for many years. The new book, published by the American Mathematical Society, has about 500 illustrations in it and was carefully designed, with particular attention to the page layout.</p>
<p>"It was an interesting exercise," Weissman said. "Pedagogically it's good, because the illustrations help with the explanations, and students get to see lots of examples. The visual element also forced me, as a writer, to find more accessible proofs, more satisfying explanations for why all these things are true.</p>
<p>Number theory is an ancient field of mathematics, with origins in Euclid's <em>Elements,</em> written around 300 BCE. Describing number theory in the book's preface, Weissman writes, "The problems in this book are about numbers and their relations to each other. These sorts of questions were interesting for mystical reasons in the ancient Greek world, for astronomical reasons to Indian mathematicians, for reasons of agriculture and government to ancient Chinese mathematicians. Today they are important to anyone who wants to understand data security."</p>
<p>Every time we check our email, Weissman explained, "your computer and the server are doing a complicated dance involving 300-digit prime numbers. Their properties are crucial to data security on a daily basis."</p>
<p>Yet he emphasizes the aesthetics of number theory over its utility. "This book is not a particularly useful book," Weissman writes in the preface. "But it might change the way you think about numbers, and you might see something beautiful that very few people have seen before."</p>
<p>In developing the book, Weissman said, he was influenced by Edward Tufte, a Yale statistician and graphic design theorist known for his books and courses on visual presentation of information. The book's design and illustrations clearly made a big impression on reviewers. One praised it for "a visual and literary flair which very few math books even strive for, let alone accomplish," while another called it "a textbook like none other I know; and not just a textbook, but a work of practical art."</p>
<p>In addition to the illustrations, the book is notable for the historical notes that accompany each chapter. Weissman said he sought to provide a scholarly historical narrative, referring to primary sources and including mathematicians outside the Western tradition.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://proseawards.com/Winners/">2018 PROSE Awards</a>, the publishing industry's top awards for professional and scholarly works, <em>An Illustrated Theory of Numbers</em> earned Honorable Mention in the Mathematics category.</p>
<p>Weissman's research involves number theory, representation theory, and geometry. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2006.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2062f4928072701777aa9bf89be7319d"><name>alumni-weekend-advance-feature-2018</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Come home, Banana Slugs</title><summary>Returning Banana Slugs are in for three days of fun, relaxation, nostalgia, thought-provoking discussions, sunsets, wine tasting, al fresco picnicking, and a pulse-raising 'fun run' through the redwoods at Alumni Weekend 2018.</summary><start-date>1520960400000</start-date><display-name>alumniweekendadvance2018</display-name><path>/2018/03/alumni-weekend-advance-feature-2018</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/alumni-weekend-advance-feature-2018</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1520961777703</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1523908842451</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/alumni-postcard-2018-300</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/alumni-postcard-2018-300</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-postcard-2018-300</name><display-name>alumni-postcard-2018-300</display-name><file-size>34374</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/alumni-postcard-thumbnail-80</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/alumni-postcard-thumbnail-80</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-postcard-thumbnail-80</name><display-name>alumni-postcard-thumbnail-80</display-name><file-size>14051</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alumni Weekend 2018: action-packed long weekend celebrates the best qualities of UC Santa Cruz </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs, come home! Time to book those plane reservations, lock down that hotel room, and check the air in your tires. The annual migration back to your alma mater will soon begin.&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Return of the Prodigal Slugs, otherwise known as <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/index.php">Alumni Weekend 2018</a>, will be a moveable slug-fest for alumni and their loved ones. Attractions include a tour through the labs of Science Hill, &#160;a roof-raising lecture about ethical universities, a peaceful stroll through an organic farm, and an energetic 5k run through campus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This extravaganza, with a &#8220;Come Home!&#8221; theme, will be so much more than a mere &#8220;reunion.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, a lot of reuniting will take place in the course of this three-day weekend, which runs from Friday, April 27, through Sunday, April 29. For instance, you are likely to run into that unrequited crush you met at that psychology seminar all those years ago, or have a spirited conversation with that roommate or resident advisor that you haven&#8217;t set eyes on since the Carter administration. The nostalgia just might overwhelm you. At one recent reunion, an alumna walked through her old cafeteria, while shouting &#8220;Flashbacks, flashbacks!&#8221; at anyone within hearing range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning Slugs will have many chances to meet up at their old colleges and mark important milestones. For instance, Merrill College and Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP) will both hold 50th anniversary celebrations on Saturday. The weekend will also include the 20th anniversary celebration for the Everett &#160;Program and 10th anniversary festivities at the World Learning Cafe at Kresge College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the weekend will also be about atmosphere, learning, and having a good old time. Many features that made last year&#8217;s Alumni Weekend such a hit with attendees will be back again, from an </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/artisinal-carryout-lunch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">artisanal carry-out lunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Saturday, April 28, to a registry showing which Slugs will be attending this year. But there will also be new twists, including </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/movie-screening-discussion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a peep into the life of pumas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a behind-the-scenes look at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s beloved radio station, KZSC FM, with a chance for former broadcasters to strut their stuff on their on all three days of Alumni Weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendance is always strong at select Alumni Weekend events; just to avoid disappointment and make sure you&#8217;ve locked down your spot at a talk or college brunch that catches your eye on the </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/schedule/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online schedule of events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, always make sure to pre-register for events. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the schedule seems action-packed, there will be lots of room to let loose and relax, take in the forested campus, </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/kresge-alumni-brunch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet award-winning author Reyna Grande</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, watch the sunset spread across the Monterey Bay, and attend as many networking luncheons as you wish. &#160;And don&#8217;t let the logistics intimidate you. An interactive </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/plan-your-visit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan Your Visit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> web page makes it easy to get parking information, figure out where to stay near UC Santa Cruz, and make your way around the beguiling 2,000-acre forested campus. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also a new app this year, which registered attendees will be invited to download and use. The app will have a full listing of events as well as your registered events, locations, descriptions, maps, a list of who&#8217;s coming, and more. In addition, the app makes it easy to exchange contact info with people you run into. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the convenience of guests, organizers will once again host centralized registration in Quarry Plaza all day on Saturday, April 28. Starting at 10 a.m. staff will have maps, information tables, music, snacks, and easy access to all events. Also for guest convenience, free transportation shuttles will run every day.</span>
<p><strong>Friday, my day &#160;</strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Weekend is like a giant, overstuffed burrito of activities and possibilities, starting on Friday, April 27. One of the kick-off events is </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/kzsc-alumni-airchecks-open-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the all-day celebration at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s homegrown college radio station</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from 10 a.m.&#8211;6 p.m. Student radio started out at UC Santa Cruz 50 years ago, so it&#8217;s no wonder that the folks over at KZSC FM&#8212;originally named KRUZ&#8212;are eager to celebrate. KZSC is also offering &#8220;Alumni Airchecks&#8221; at the same time frame on Saturday and Sunday. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni programmers are invited back to the station to spin some vintage tunes live on the air and share personal reflections about their glory days on the airwaves. (Those of you who wish to take part may contact Maelin at </span><a href="mailto:alumni@kzsc.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alumni@kzsc.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to schedule a slot.) Current radio staff will be hanging around to document the stories of returning alumni and give &#8220;flashback tours&#8217;&#8217; to returning Slugs. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday is also a great time for alumni to stop by and say &#8220;hello&#8221; to their favorite physics professors at the&#160;</span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/physics-open-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physics Department Open House </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from 1&#8211;6 p.m. &#160;From 2&#8211;3:20 p.m., the open house will feature a special colloquium for alumni, faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Lab tours will be held from 3:20&#8211;5 p.m., showcasing some exciting research that physics faculty and graduate students are doing. There will also be a chance to tour the new off-campus lab facilities at 2300 Delaware Ave. on the Westside of Santa Cruz. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today is a good day to catch up with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Graduate Division, which will host several events on this day, including a </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/graduate-student-alumni-career-paths-panel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Student Alumni Career Paths Panel </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at Stevenson Fireside Lounge at 10 a.m. and a </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/graduate-research-symposium/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Research Symposium </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">at 1:30 p.m. at McHenry Library Information Commons. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s Alumni Weekend also delves deeply into the world of the arts. Dance aficionados should venture out to the Hitchcock Lounge in the &#8220;Porter Quad&#8221; of Porter College for a dance theater performance of </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/shahnameh-and-beyond-in-iran-india-and-diasporas/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahnameh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the great epic of the Muslim world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, starting at &#160;7:30 p.m.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year also offers some off-campus options that should not be missed. &#160;The good times will roll from 5&#8211;7 p.m. at the </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/alumni-weekend-kickoff-celebration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Weekend Kickoff Celebration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Aloha Terrace at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, a great chance to mingle and sip a cool drink before the main festivities begin. Admission is $15. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re looking to round out the night with another great off-campus Alumni Weekend event on Friday evening, head to Astronomy on Tap, which twines the excitement of astronomy with the hoppy deliciousness of cold, tasty beer. Two lecturers will present short public talks. Attendees should also expect bar-type games, and astronomy-related swag. This &#8220;stellar&#8221; event takes place at the offices of Cruzio at 877 Center Street, Suite 150, in downtown Santa Cruz. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back up on campus, tireless Crown College alumni who don&#8217;t mind staying up late should make tracks toward the Crown Senior Commons at Crown College, where the second-annual alumni-only </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/2nd-annual-slug-soiree/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Soir&#233;e</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be sure to deliver a strong hit of nostalgia. In fact, organizers say the event space will be transformed, as if by magic, into &#8220;the boho den of Pioneer Crownie memory.&#8221; All Crown alumni are encouraged to drop in, rekindle old friendships, meet new alumni friends, and enjoy a buffet dinner and drinks. </span></p>
<p><strong>Saturday, what a day </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a night of revels and relaxation, nothing peps up the spirit like a wild dash across campus. Lace up those high-performance Brooks Beast shoes and hit the trail, starting at 8 a.m., for the </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/campus-5k-fun-run/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus 5K Fun Run,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which starts at the OPERS East Field House and rambles through all 10 colleges and some of the most iconic and nostalgic spots on campus. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday is also a chance to &#8220;get wild&#8221; at the </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ucsc-bioblitz-younger-lagoon-bioblitz-please-list-both-on-same-page/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Bioblitz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Younger Lagoon Bioblitz, allowing alumni to take part in an inventory of wildlife, from 9 a.m. to noon.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or stick around the campus and enjoy </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/ibsc-stem-cell-faculty-lectures-and-lab-tour/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a faculty lecture and private tour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells starting at 9 a.m.; </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/tour-of-the-casfs-ucsc-farm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tour UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s influential and beautiful 30-acre organic farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 10&#8211;11:30 a.m. (here&#8217;s a friendly reminder to register for a tour in advance; they always fill up!), and enjoy a new edition of the Teach-In, which is becoming a favorite Alumni Weekend tradition, allowing students to learn from great professors without worrying about any pesky pop quizzes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eye-opening Teach-In, entitled &#8220;</span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/teach-in-with-citl-how-slugs-teach-and-learn-now-what-is-active-learning-and-why-does-it-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Slugs Teach And Learn Now: What is Active Learning And Why Does It Matter?&#8221;,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> runs from 12:30&#8211;2 p.m. at Humanities Room 259, starring four of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s most innovative educators. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of influential professors, the </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/faculty-keynote/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty Keynote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lecture, delivered by beloved feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker at an equally beloved, and recently reopened, campus landmark, the UC Santa Cruz Quarry Amphitheater, is sure to draw a large crowd. This will be a great opportunity to hear Aptheker in conversation with Marlene Tromp, campus provost and executive vice chancellor, about the ethical role of public universities. The talk goes from 11 a.m.&#8211;12:15 p.m. Whether you have never seen the dynamic Aptheker in action, or are one of her reported 16,000 students from some point in the past 40 years, you won&#8217;t want to miss out. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this activity is bound to make you hungry.

The good times start at noon and last until 4 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday is also the time to catch a fascinating lecture by an award-winning scholar, Professor Mark Massoud, politics and legal studies, who will speak about the lived experience of Islamic law for Muslims in Somalia, Sudan, and California, followed by an on-stage discussion between Professor Massoud and best-selling writer Laurie R. King. Massoud will deliver this year&#8217;s </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/noel-q-king-memorial-lecture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noel Q. King Memorial Lecture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is part of Merrill College&#8217;s 50th anniversary celebration. </span></p>

<p><strong>Sunday, fun day </strong></p>

The talk, hosted by Kresge provost Ben Leeds Carson, starts at 9:30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Round out the day with your choice of brunches taking place at various colleges across the campus, but don&#8217;t say your goodbyes until you&#8217;ve had a chance to take part in another cherished tradition of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Alumni Weekend bashes, the annual </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/annual-dizikes-concert-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dizikes Concert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the yard outside the Cowell Provost&#8217;s House. Everyone is welcome to dance and sway the afternoon away in this special event honoring John Dizikes, professor emeritus of American studies at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, well-satisfied Slugs can say their goodbyes to old pals and to their alma mater, at least for now. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="20b8f1368072701777aa9bf8ea54d36c"><name>game-design</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz ranked among top schools for game design</title><summary>As in past years, UC Santa Cruz is featured on Princeton Review's 2018 lists for top undergraduate and graduate programs in game design.</summary><keywords>computational media</keywords><start-date>1520924400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz ranked among top schools for game design</display-name><path>/2018/03/game-design</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/game-design</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1520967412942</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1521472755616</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/game-logo-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/game-logo-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>game-logo-300.jpg</name><display-name>game-logo-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>65280</file-size><width>300</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>princeton review logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/game-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/game-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>game-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>game-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24390</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>princeton review logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>As in past years, UC Santa Cruz is featured on Princeton Review's 2018 lists for top undergraduate and graduate programs in game design</article-subhead><article-text><p>The game design programs at UC Santa Cruz were named among the top programs in the country by the Princeton Review, an education services company. The undergraduate and graduate programs at UC Santa Cruz were both ranked in the top 25 in the company's lists for 2018 of the best undergraduate and graduate schools for students to study game design and launch a career in the game industry.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ranked 13th on the Princeton Review's list of the "Top 25" graduate schools and 17th on the list of the "Top 50" undergraduate programs. The full lists are posted at <a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings/game-design">Top Game Design Schools 2018</a>. The web site also provides information on the Princeton Review's methodology for the rankings and profiles of the schools.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is the top-ranked institution in a recent survey of <a href="http://www.kmjn.org/game-rankings/">institutions involved in technical games research</a>. Compiled by artificial intelligence researcher Mark Nelson, these rankings are based on publications in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
<p>UCSC offers a broad range of programs in computer game design. The Baskin School of Engineering established the first undergraduate major in computer game design in the UC system in 2006. In addition to B.S. and B.A. degrees in game design, the campus also has three graduate programs with an emphasis on games: the professional M.S. in games and playable media; the Ph.D. or M.S. in computational media; and the M.F.A. in digital arts and new media in the Arts Division.</p>
<p>The Princeton Review based its rankings on a survey it conducted in 2017 of 150 institutions offering game design coursework or degrees in the United States, Canada, and some countries abroad.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chancellor George Blumenthal gushed like a true fan when he met award-winning actress and distinguished UC Santa Cruz alumna Adilah Barnes on Thursday afternoon. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Greeting Barnes in his office, Blumenthal raved about her recent performance as Mama in a revival of the groundbreaking play </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Raisin in the Sun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that took place at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Second Stage theater. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a fantastic performance,&#8221; said Blumenthal, who saw the play on opening night. &#8220;It was really moving. I love the fact that you are working with students.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a token of the campus&#8217;s appreciation, Blumenthal presented Barnes with the Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award for her many artistic contributions to UC Santa Cruz, recognizing her mentorship of student actors-in-training, as well as her strong, longstanding connections to the campus. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean of the Arts Susan Solt and her staff were there to congratulate Barnes, who also received a UC Santa Cruz First Generation Initiative T-shirt, drawing attention to students and faculty who&#8212;like Barnes&#8212;were the first in their family to graduate from a four-year college or university.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An award-winning performer with many film, television, and stage credits, Barnes had a longstanding role as Anne Marie on ABC's&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseanne</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is now being revived, with new episodes. Her film credits include the blockbuster award-winning&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Brockovich</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;and&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murder by Numbers.</span></i><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz production</span><strong>&#160;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">was directed by lecturer Don Williams and featured drama students from the African American Theatre Arts Troupe, an ensemble he founded on campus in 1991. Williams, who has worked with Barnes on several other occasions, including her performance in a solo show at UC Santa Cruz, praised her acting chops as well as her ability to inspire young performers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Adilah has the right spirit about theater, and an excellent vision when it comes to building character,&#8221; said Williams, founder and artistic director of the African American Theater Arts Troupe. &#8220;She is kind of like a magic wand that every student wants to measure up to. They want to know how she does what she does.&#8221; Many students ended up &#8220;taking notes&#8217;&#8217; about the way Barnes creates and embodies her character, right down to the shoes she wears, he added. &#8220;Even when she is not talking (on stage), she is in the moment.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her return to UC Santa Cruz has felt like a homecoming for Barnes. &#8220;It&#8217;s been very exciting and rewarding,&#8221; especially considering how much her years on campus helped her finesse her craft, she said. &#8220;Many of those experiences that I had here really served me, in terms of moving forward. I really cut my teeth on theater here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her many appearances in dramatic productions, Barnes cofounded the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival, an annual multicultural solo festival now in its 25th year, and founded the Writers Well international literary retreat for women in Sharpsburg, Georgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnes has also toured 40 states and three continents (including North America, Africa, and Europe) with her one-woman play,&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Am That I Am: Woman, Black.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Her first book,&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On My Own Terms,&#160;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was published in 2008 and ranked number three in June 2009 on the&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essence </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">magazine best-seller list just behind two books by Barack Obama. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">On My Own Terms</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes a chapter detailing her experiences at UC Santa Cruz. After receiving her award, Barnes, a Cowell College affiliate, presented Blumenthal with a signed copy of the book last week.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-barnes-adilah.html</url><title>Adilah Barnes: UC Santa Cruz Year of Alumni profile</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2145ec668072701777aa9bf807cfa673"><name>ag-tunnels</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Homegrown help</title><summary>New ag tunnels will allow the UC Santa Cruz Farm and Garden to provide a year-round supply of healthy, low-cost produce to dining halls, food pantries, and market pop-ups on campus as part of the effort to address food insecurity. </summary><start-date>1520924400000</start-date><display-name>Addressing food insecurity</display-name><path>/2018/03/ag-tunnels</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/ag-tunnels</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1520976652251</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1521582184119</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Feature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/ag-tunnel-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/ag-tunnel-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ag-tunnel-500px.jpg</name><display-name>ag-tunnel-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>245444</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Tractor driving in ag tunnel</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/ag-tunnel-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/ag-tunnel-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ag-tunnel-80px.jpg</name><display-name>ag-tunnel-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>15428</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Tractor driving in ag tunnel</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The ag tunnels, purchased with funding from the UC Global Food Initiative,&#160;<span>mean students will have greater variety of veggies, especially during cold and rainy winters when choices were limited to produce like potatoes and kale.

It&#8217;s a picturesque scene: winter-gnarled trees in the background and soft green lettuce seedlings stretching out in a long row next to beds planted with beets and spinach.</p>
<p>But this tunnel&#8212;one of four greenhouse-like structures&#8212;is also an important new step in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s plan to help combat food insecurity, a problem faced by one in ten students, according to a 2016 UC systemwide report. The recently installed ag tunnels, or hoop houses, will allow the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://casfs.ucsc.edu">Farm and Garden</a> to provide a year-round supply of healthy, low-cost produce to dining halls, food pantries, and market pop-ups on campus. They are also at the center of a new focus for the Farm and Garden.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting development for Bishop (Kresge, &#8217;18, sociology) who works 20 hours a week at the farm and also as the land-based co-chair of the campus Food Systems Working Group and who, just this morning, harvested 100 bunches of kale for the dining halls.</p>
<p>Not only will these hoop houses help provide students with a healthier option than ramen noodles during the entire school year, she says, but they may also help students develop an understanding of how food gets to the table&#8212;and also a taste for fresh, organic produce</p>
<p>&#8220;To find out the difference between a dried-out carrot shipped from the East Coast and a fresh carrot right out of the ground?&#8221; Bishop says. &#8220;Omigod.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem of <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/gfi/resources.html">student food insecurity</a> came to light in a 2016 UC study that found 19 percent of students reported they sometimes had gone hungry during the year. Another 23 percent said they had limited access to a variety of good-quality food because of a lack of money.</p>
<p>In California, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 14 percent of households face food insecurity.</p>
<p>Experts point to rising costs and the high price of living in California as a reason why college students are going hungry or eating cheap junky alternatives. In Santa Cruz, which is one of the five least affordable cities for renters in the U.S. according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the cost of an undergrad living on campus for one year is $36,192. A student living off campus needs $32,685. For many, that doesn&#8217;t leave a lot of cash for a balanced, healthy diet.</p>
<p>This is where the UC Santa Cruz Farm is stepping in.</p>
<p>For much of its life, the campus&#8217;s 35-acre farm&#8212;used for research and teaching&#8212;sold its harvest at a market cart at the base of campus and to its Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) clients, who get weekly shares of fruits and vegetable for a yearly subscription fee.</p>
<p>But a push for the farm to create a deeper connection with the campus, along with a UC system pledge to make sure students have enough nutritious food to eat, set off a shift in direction.</p>
<p>Kirstin Yogg, who used to run a small farm on Santa Cruz&#8217;s north coast and is now field site production manager on campus, says the farm plans to cut the number of CSA customers from approximately 100 to 80 and also open the market cart only one day instead of two. This will allow more farm-raised produce to go directly to dining halls, to a pair of free food pantries that serve low-income students, and to twin pop-up farmstands on campus that provide a cheaper and easier way to get nutritious food.</p>
<p>The first pop-up, which began in 2015 at Quarry Plaza, was so popular a second site was launched at Rachel Carson College this January. Selling everything from kale to kiwi, the stands provide organic produce not only from the UC Santa Cruz Farm and Garden but also from two local farmers markets at about half the cost of what is found elsewhere&#8212;made possible by Global Food Initiative funding along with agreements worked out with local farmers markets, according to Tim Galarneau, UC Basic Needs co-chair. The <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/global-food-initiative/">Global Food Initiative</a> is a UC systemwide program designed to address the problem of feeding a growing and hungry world.</p>
<p>Now, the 22-by&#8211;170-foot hoop houses, purchased along with seed with $27,000 in Global Food Initiative funding, mean students will have greater variety of veggies, especially during cold and rainy winters when choices were limited to things like potatoes and kale. The tunnels also add about a quarter acre of productive land to the farm. In fact, the first planting of about half of one hoop house will yield some 700 heads of lettuce and 200 pounds of spinach, according to Yogg.</p>
<p>Galarneau says money from the Global Food Initiative along with funds from AB453, the Hunger-Free Campus Act, also will be used to buy a 4X4 cart to help work-study students like Bishop harvest crops, to fund two new food storage containers, and to purchase an electric cart so produce can be delivered to food pantries and the pop-ups. A plan to have days when students can harvest their own fruits and vegetables also is in the works, along with surveys to find out exactly the kind of produce students want.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an exciting new direction for us,&#8221; Yogg says. &#8220;A lot of staff are feeling energized by the shift in our focus. We will continue to supply produce to our longtime supporters but it&#8217;s fun to connect with students as well.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/images/sap-infographic.jpg"><img alt="Survey results summary graphic" caption="false" height="420" src="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/images/sap-infographic-email.jpg" width="700"/></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen great results with our prioritization survey, with 616 individuals responding: 273 faculty, 211 staff, 80 undergraduates and 52 graduate students. The survey polled the campus on the most important criteria by which to assess the proposals that emerge from our Themed Academic Working Groups. Faculty, staff, and students showed remarkable alignment in their desire to promote research areas "addressing a big societal issue or challenge with the potential to have a real-world impact" and ones that are "multidisciplinary with the potential to engage many members of the campus community." These two criteria enjoyed the strongest support.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis illustrates breakdowns along divisional lines and roles. Faculty and students in Engineering rated the "potential to generate resources" as the single most important factor. The same groups in Arts and Humanities assessed "resource generation" much lower and emphasized the importance of "advancing diversity in research and teaching." Physical and Biological Sciences deemed nothing more important than "areas in which the campus already has strength or is recognized," while Social Sciences responses were close to the average with noticeable spikes emphasizing "diversity" and "areas in which UC Santa Cruz can make a unique contribution."</p>
<p>Faculty rated the criteria "in an area in which the campus already has strength or is recognized" almost as highly as they rated "multidisciplinary." The responses of undergraduate and graduate students closely tracked with faculty and staff for the top-rated criteria, but undergraduates also highly valued "resource generation" and "innovations in teaching and learning," while grad students stressed the importance of "advancing diversity."</p>

<h3>Themed Groups</h3>
<p>The CP/EVC&#8217;s staff set up 60 initial meetings for Themed Academic Working Groups on Wednesday through Friday of last week. The groups came together to begin (or continue) conversations on how they could effectively collaborate on shared research interests and advance the research and teaching mission of the university. We look forward to seeing the final reports the groups produce by the April 19 deadline. For more information on the timeline for submission and review of the proposals, <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/get-involved.html">visit the SAP website</a>.</p>
<p>While the themed groups have occupied much attention over the past month, it&#8217;s important to bear in mind they are only one aspect of a larger planning process. At the upcoming Future State Design workshops, we will talk about advancing diversity, preparing students for the job market, student success, sustainability, and other issues of paramount importance to the campus. See below for more details.</p>
<h3>Upcoming</h3>
<p>We will host an-all campus Future State Design workshop on Tuesday, March 20, from 1:30-5 p.m. in 108 Digital Arts Research Center. The workshop will ask participants to suggest, refine, and debate the "design principles" that will guide our trajectory over the next five years. Design principles are clear, tightly defined guidelines that identify a set of institutional aspirations. So, for example, some potential design principles might include: "Drive research and creative work that transforms our world," and "Prepare students to make an impact in a changing world." <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwpapcOVSm5irRpQQjwqHgHgv43BqSiARYydmShIO2Mlnybg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Please register</a> by Thursday, March 15, to join the conversation.</p>

<p>The grant from NIH's <a href="https://orip.nih.gov/construction-and-instruments/s10-instrumentation-programs">High End Instrumentation program</a> funds the acquisition of a new electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer to be based at UC Santa Cruz and used by researchers from around the San Francisco Bay Area. In particular, the new instrument will provide a state-of-the-art platform for performing DEER (double electron-electron resonance), a powerful technique for solving challenging problems in structural biology.</p>
<p>Glenn Millhauser, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, is the principal investigator for the grant and an expert in the field of EPR.</p>
<p>"What's great about DEER is that we can get snapshots of how proteins change shapes as they perform their functions, and how mutations in disease inhibit proper function," he said. "We can also use it to get insights into the arrangement and organization of large multi-protein complexes when we know only the structures of individual protein building blocks."</p>
<p>In his own research, Millhauser uses DEER to study prion proteins, which contribute to neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Other UC Santa Cruz researchers who will use the facility include biochemist Nikolaos Sgourakis, who studies T-cell receptor proteins that play a critical role in the immune response, and biochemist Carrie Partch, who studies the biological clock that drives circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Other major users of the facility include scientists at UC Davis, UC San Francisco, UC Merced, and Stanford University. Biochemist Andy LiWang at UC Merced and David Britt at UC Davis, for example, both study biological clocks (and LiWang has collaborated with both Partch and Britt). William DeGrado at UCSF studies histidine kinase membrane proteins (important players in bacterial sensing mechanisms); James Ames at UC Davis studies calcium-binding proteins essential in vision; and Liang Feng at Stanford University studies glucose membrane transporters.</p>
<p>Many of these researchers have been using the existing EPR equipment at UC Santa Cruz, which has been through several upgrades since it was originally installed in 1989.</p>
<p>"The new instrument will be much faster and provide finer data. What now takes us a day will only take an hour on the new instrument," Millhauser said. "This facility is going to be unique in the Bay Area."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has long been a hub of growth and innovation in the use of magnetic resonance techniques. Millhauser also oversees the campus's NMR Facility, which researchers use to perform nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, another important technique in structural biology. ("EPR looks at electrons in the same way that NMR looks at the nuclei of atoms," Millhauser explained.)</p>
<p>A major NIH grant in 2015 funded the acquisition of a $2.5 million NMR spectrometer for the facility, which Millhauser said is "humming all the time." He noted that NIH only funds about 25 high-end instrumentation grants nationwide every year. With this level of intense competition, the two recent grants awarded to UC Santa Cruz are indicative of the campus's stature in the area of biological magnetic resonance.</p>

<p>But what happens in the dark may have profound implications above ground, too: A major new study reveals that soil fungi could play a significant role in the ability of forests to adapt to environmental change.</p>
<p>Kai Zhu, assistant professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, took a unique "big data" approach to investigating the role of symbiotic fungi in tree migration in forests across the eastern United States.</p>
<p>"Our climate is rapidly changing, and our forests are responding, but in very slow motion&#8212;it's hardly detectable," said Zhu, who wanted to identify factors that contribute to the pace of that response.</p>
<p>In forests, tree growth largely depends on the nutrients available in the soil, while the transfer of carbon through roots to the soil regulates ecosystem processes. Mycorrhizal ("MY-koe-RY-zull") fungi grow on the roots of most plants and drive the nutrient-carbon exchange between plants and soil: They take up carbon resources from their hosts and provide soil nutrients that plants need. The two most common fungi associated with forest trees are ectomycorrhizal (ECM), which grow on conifers, including pines, oaks, and beeches, and arbuscular (AM), which grow on most nonconifers, such as maples.</p>
<p>Zhu utilized data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Inventory and Analysis program to examine how soil carbon and nitrogen levels differ across stands of forest that are characterized by "AM dominant" trees and "ECM dominant" trees. He correlated the distribution of trees with soil fungi and content, then analyzed the distribution of trees by fungus type. In the most significant finding, Zhu was able to identify distinct soil nitrogen "signatures" that impact soils and ecosystems in ways that may determine the resilience of forests to the changing climate.</p>
<p>Specifically, soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratios increase with greater ECM dominance&#8212;even after accounting for climate, soil texture, and foliar nitrogen. Moreover, ECM dominance is more associated with low soil nitrogen rather than high soil carbon.</p>
<p>"These findings suggest that AM and ECM trees have differential success along nitrogen fertility gradients, or perhaps that AM and ECM trees promote differences in cycling rates of carbon and nitrogen because of traits associated with nitrogen acquisition," he said. "Both processes may occur simultaneously, leading to a self-reinforcing positive plant-soil feedback."</p>
<p>Zhu's findings suggest that the mycorrhizal guild could be an emerging "functional trait."</p>
<p>Functional traits&#160;are those that define species in terms of their ecological roles&#8212;how they interact with the environment and with other species. As such, they are predictable and easily measured from the ground or by satellite, which makes them particularly valuable to scientists who are monitoring environmental responses to climate change. "They tell us how the ecosystem is responding," said Zhu.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence yet that eastern forests are shifting their geographic ranges to higher latitudes in response to warming temperatures," said Zhu. "But understanding how mycorrhizal relationships impact ecosystems will help us predict how forests will respond to global change."</p>
<p>Zhu's <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.12918/full">study</a>, published in the <em>Journal of Ecology</em>, is one of the first to use the USDA's large-scale data set to see how climate change is impacting the ecosystem, an approach known as "top down" rather than "bottom up."</p>
<p>As a quantitative environmental scientist, Zhu brings the tools of statistics and data science to the study of global ecology. Rather than measuring fungal traits in the soil and scaling up, Zhu uses existing data&#8212;including large-scale datasets generated by satellites&#8212;to look at patterns and processes playing out on continental and global scales. "Big data is becoming more and more popular and powerful," he said. "It's different from traditional research in ecology, which takes place in a lab or in the field."</p>
<p>Zhu, whose background is in physics and systems theory, brings tremendous urgency to his work on climate change. His research focuses on four areas: forest ecosystems, grassland, soil, and phenology, which Zhu describes as "nature's calendar."</p>
<p>Zhu is determined to make solid contributions to a field in which much of the evidence is incomplete and unconvincing.</p>
<p>"We know the environment is changing, but how it impacts the Earth and its systems is a big question," he said. "As scientists, we have the responsibility to correctly work out this problem&#8212;it's a problem that's important to scientists and the general public."</p>

Buildings line the walking paths at unusual, seemingly random angles. The stairs connecting Kresge&#8217;s two main walkways tumble together in such a wild jumble of shapes that it feels like a stretch to call it a staircase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here and there, walls and ceilings pop with bright primary colors. It would be a mistake, however, to think that these features are a result of haphazard designers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kresge&#8217;s bold construction, an early example of postmodern architecture, creates just the right environment for students who want to take creative and intellectual risks and forge their own paths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just ask Kresge&#8217;s provost, Associate Professor of Music Ben Leeds Carson, an exemplar of out-of-the box thinking who wrote an opera based on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Star Trek </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that drew capacity crowds to the Music Center&#8217;s Recital Hall in the summer of 2016. &#8220;We&#8217;re a grassroots community in Kresge,&#8221; Carson said. &#8220;I know I can count on students to speak with conviction and passion, and to act with compassion.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge is not the kind of place where staff and faculty ignore student input. Instead, their voices are a key factor in decision-making. &#8220;Sometimes we do more following than leading,&#8221; Carson said, referring to professors and administrators deferring to student voices. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carson holds weekly office hours for Kresge students to share their views and concerns. Students are major participants in the ongoing Kresge College renovation plan, which is updating Kresge structures with the goal of creating more housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its focus on student input and critical thinking, it is no wonder that this hotbed for autonomy and creativity has incubated so many successful writers, activists, and entrepreneurs. Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning Associated Press reporter and author Martha Mendoza (Kresge &#8216;88, individual major) is just one of the newsmakers who got her start here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a Kresge student, and with mentorship of Kresge faculty Conn Hallinan, Roz Spafford, and Paul Skenazy, I was able to write my own major, pursuing my studies in journalism and education by taking the courses, internships, and independent studies that I was most interested in,&#8221; Mendoza said. &#8220;This was critical to my growth at that time.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other notable Kresge alumni include </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/12/mandela-ucsc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas Foster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kresge &#8216;76, individual major), professor of journalism at Northwestern University and contributor to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/king-laurie-r.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laurie King</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kresge &#8216;77, religious studies), a detective fiction author; and </span><a href="https://kresge.ucsc.edu/news-events/profiles/Reyna%20Grande.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reyna Grande</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kresge &#8216;99, literature), who won the American Book Award for her novel</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Across a Hundred Mountains</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of the college&#8217;s faculty fellows are acclaimed writers and poets. One of Kresge&#8217;s 11 residential buildings is even called the Writer&#8217;s House, whose residents maintain a house blog and partner with the Literature Department to host regular creative writing workshops.</span></p>
<p><strong>Roots of a campus &#8216;village&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was founded in 1971, the college was not intended to be a radical educational experiment, but it quickly become one anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a $650,000 donation from the Kresge Foundation&#8212;from the family who put the K in Kmart (the company was founded by S. S. Kresge)&#8212;UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding Chancellor Dean McHenry recruited Robert Edgar, an internationally known geneticist from Caltech, to be Kresge&#8217;s first provost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edgar, who had a strong interest in experimental undergraduate education and humanistic psychology, brought in the psychologist Michael Kahn to help run the college. With Edgar and Kahn in charge, the college became a center for radical education and democratic participation. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first class ever offered at Kresge, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Kresge College,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the precursor to Kresge&#8217;s current core course. It provided an interdisciplinary approach to the social sciences and was a venue for students who wanted to play an active role in how the college should function. Kresge&#8217;s leaders really meant it when they said that Kresge&#8217;s students should take part in college planning; in fact, during the early years, Kresge students helped control the $100,000 budget for college programming. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students also wielded their influence by forming kin groups that met outside class to discuss academic and personal aspects of college life. This was a prime example of the early ethos of the college&#8217;s living/learning experiment. The social and emotional aspects of college life were meant to influence the cognitive aspects, and vice versa; classroom learning, and the day-to-day lives of students, were intertwined. </span></p>
<p><strong>Architecture </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the structures in Kresge, including the famous steps, reflect the college&#8217;s independent nature. Designed by Charles Moore and William Turnbull, Kresge&#8217;s playful, bright colors and geometric shapes are a fresh response to the stripped-down modern style that was popular in the middle of the 20th century.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge&#8217;s landmarks, including Kresge Town Hall, Upper Street, Lower Street, and the piazzetta&#8212;an Italian-style town square&#8212;all sound like things you&#8217;d find in a small town rather than a corner of a college campus. If UC Santa Cruz is a &#8220;city on a hill,&#8221; then Kresge is a village within those city walls.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each design element reflects the social and academic values of the designers. The wide, meandering Lower Street, connecting the administrative and residential buildings, gives students plenty of room to wander. Students study at the tables scattered around Lower Street and in the piazzetta. As the path narrows along Upper Street toward Town Hall and the Owl&#8217;s Nest, Kresge&#8217;s restaurant, larger residential buildings cluster close together and create a more dynamic and social atmosphere, encouraging students to mingle. </span></p>
<p><strong>A sense of autonomy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge students have</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a long history of independent thinking. In fact, in 1990, they pushed this concept to its extreme by seceding from the rest of the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The catalyst was an ongoing debate, among campus administrators and faculty members, about the future of the campus&#8217;s iconic narrative evaluation system, which used written commentary on student learning and performance instead of traditional A through F grading. Kresge students wanted to keep narrative evaluations, arguing that they discouraged classroom competition and fostered a better sense of learning. Critics argued that they harmed the campus&#8217;s reputation, and that increasing class sizes made it much more difficult for professors to write meaningful assessments. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, students were given the option of receiving a grade along with the evaluation or a &#8220;Pass/No Pass&#8221; designation. During the &#8220;secession&#8221; all non-Kresge students had to show their campus ID card when arriving in the college.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2001, UC Santa Cruz moved away from the narrative evaluation system when a majority of faculty voted for letter grades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Kresgians abandoned their secession effort, they have never lost their autonomous personality, creativity, and vision. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge has changed over the years but still retains its distinct atmosphere, including its strong emphasis on student autonomy, especially when it comes to buying and preparing food. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this day, Kresge is the only college at UC Santa Cruz where first-year students live in apartments, complete with a kitchen.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The college also has its own grocery co-op and garden co-op. By producing and preparing their own food, Kresgians, as they call themselves, don&#8217;t need to rely on the dining hall or campus cafes for nourishment.</span>

<p>Presented by the Arts Division&#8217;s <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu"><strong><em>Institute of the Arts and Sciences</em></strong></a> in collaboration with the Arboretum and the San Jose Museum of Art, this will be the West Coast debut of FOREST, which was originally commissioned for Documenta 13 in Kassel, Germany.</p>
<p>The installation employs sound to evoke history, memory, sensation, and site, exploring what you might hear in a forest over hundreds of years. The artists use a technology known as Ambisonics, developed by a mathematician nearly 50 years ago, which enables them to create a three-dimensional sound field out of various noises, vibrations, or explosions that they have collected and recorded.</p>
<p>The sounds range from the gentle calls of wildlife on a forested Canadian island, to the loud clamor of historical re-enactors on a European battlefield<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Janet and George&#8217;s work is unique in contemporary art,&#8221; said John Weber, founding director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences. &#8220;They create pieces that combine aesthetic sophistication of the highest order with an accessibility to broad audiences that is, I believe, unlike anything else in art today. They are storytellers who understand emotion, psychology, and plot, and their works have an experiential impact that is simply breathtaking. People are going to love this!&#8221;</p>
<p>Weber noted that he has previously worked with the two artists at SFMOMA and at the Tang Museum before he came to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a huge fan of their work,&#8221; said Weber. &#8220;FOREST premiered six years ago in the most important influential exhibition of contemporary art in the world, Documenta 13, and it was widely heralded as one of the strongest pieces in the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregory Volk described the impact of the work in a piece for&#160;<em>Art in America </em>magazine:</p>
<p><em>"A remarkable thing about Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller's utterly captivating sound installation is how it blurs distinctions between site and art. You enter a clearing in the forest, sit down on a wooden stump, and simply listen. Cardiff and Bures Miller's work incorporates the actual forest into an audio composition emitted from more than 30 speakers. Sometimes there is a near synchronicity of natural and mediated sounds, and it's tough to discern what is live and what is recorded...In turn frightening and deeply touching, ominous and serene, Cardiff and Bures Miller's forest soundscape is a wonder."</em></p>
<p>Cardiff and Miller are internationally recognized artists known for their immersive multimedia sound installations and their audio and video walks. Their recent solo exhibitions include: 21st Century Museum, Kanazawa, (2017); ARoS Aarhus Art Museum (2015); and Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid (2015).</p>
<p>Their recent group exhibitions include Being Modern: MoMA in Paris, Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris (2017); and the 19th Biennale of Sydney (2014). In 2011, Cardiff and Miller won Germany&#8217;s prestigious K&#228;the Kollwitz Prize. They also represented Canada at the 2001 Venice Biennale, winning the Biennale's Premio Speciale and Benesse Prize.</p>
<p>"<em>FOREST&#160;</em>is an acclaimed work of the highest international caliber, and this is only its second showing in the United States,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz dean of the arts Susan Solt. &#8220;Yes, we are setting the bar high!&#160;I am very proud that the Arts Division's Institute of the Arts and Sciences under John Weber's&#160;visionary directorship brings exhibitions such as these to our campus.&#160;There is simply no substitute for giving our students and the community direct experience to art works of this impact and significance. We are delighted to be showing Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>

Called the Radiated Energy Enhancement Factor (REEF), it provides a measure of earthquake rupture complexity that better captures variations in the amount and duration of slip along the fault for events that may have similar magnitudes. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Magnitude is a measure of the relative size of an earthquake. There are several different magnitude scales (including the original Richter scale), with the &#8220;moment magnitude&#8221; now the most widely used measure because it is uniformly applicable to all sizes of earthquakes. The seismic energy released in an earthquake can also be measured directly from recorded ground shaking, providing a distinct measure of the earthquake process. Earthquakes of a given magnitude can have very different radiated seismic energy.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Researchers at UC Santa Cruz and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) devised REEF in an effort to understand variations in the rupture characteristics of the largest and most destructive earthquakes, such as the 2004 Sumatra earthquake (magnitude 9.2) and 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan (magnitude 9.1). They introduced the new measurement in a paper published March 21 in </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Science Advances</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">. First author Lingling Ye, a former UC Santa Cruz graduate student and Caltech postdoctoral researcher, is now at Sun Yat-sen University in China. Her coauthors are Hiroo Kanamori at Caltech and Thorne Lay at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">REEF is measured by the ratio of the earthquake&#8217;s actual measured radiated energy (in seismic waves recorded around the world) to the minimum possible energy that an event of equal seismic moment and rupture duration would produce. If the rupture is jerky and irregular, it radiates more seismic energy, especially at high frequencies, and this indicates frictional conditions and dynamic processes on the fault plane during rupture, Lay explained. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The researchers made systematic measurements of REEF for 119 recent major earthquakes of magnitudes 7.0 to 9.2. They found clear regional patterns, with some subduction zones having higher REEF ruptures on average than other zones. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This indicates, for the first time, that energy release is influenced by regional properties of each fault zone,&#8221; said Lay, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The precise cause of some regions radiating higher energy in an event of given size is still under investigation, but may be linked to regional differences in the roughness of the faults, in the fluid distributions on the faults, or in the sediments trapped in the fault zone, he said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Further research using REEF could help seismologists achieve better understanding of earthquake mechanics and earthquake hazards around the world.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This research was supported by the National Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and U.S. National Science Foundation.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3fe011188072701777aa9bf806ac7494"><name>massoud-lecture-noel-king-2018-advance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Understanding shari’a</title><summary>Mark Fathi Massoud, associate professor of politics and legal studies at UC Santa Cruz, will delve into the realities, subtleties, and richness of Islamic law and ethics at this year's Noel Q.

Often translated as Islamic law, it also encompasses something much broader: ethical formation, faith traditions, and living practices that invite interpretation, learning, and education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such adaptability and interactivity may come as a surprise to those who view shari&#8217;a as top-down, monolithic, and unchanging. Professor Mark Fathi Massoud will delve more deeply into the realities, subtleties, and richness of Islamic law and ethics in his address, &#8220;The Struggle for Shari&#8217;a: Islamic Law in Modern Times,&#8221; a highlight of this year&#8217;s</span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Weekend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud, associate professor of politics and legal studies at UC Santa Cruz, will deliver the third annual</span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/noel-q-king-memorial-lecture/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Noel Q. King Memorial Lecture in History and Comparative Religion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Saturday, April 28, 2:30&#8211;3:30 p.m. at the Merrill Cultural Center at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lecture honors the memory of UC Santa Cruz Professor</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2009/02/2711.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Noel Q. King</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who helped introduce the study of comparative religion to the campus. He engaged Santa Cruz students in his lifelong curiosity about and respect for diverse religions and beliefs. A popular teacher and respected scholar, King died in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following his presentation, Massoud, who researches and teaches in the areas of international law, human rights, and the politics of law and religion, will have an onstage discussion with Laurie R. King, best-selling novelist, holder of an honorary doctorate from the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, and Noel King&#8217;s widow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud&#8217;s talk will draw in part from his extensive research on law in Somalia and Sudan, the subjects of his current book project and his award-winning first book,</span><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/fragilestate"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law&#8217;s Fragile State: Colonial, Authoritarian, and Humanitarian Legacies in Sudan</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He will also discuss new research on the role of shari&#8217;a for Muslims here in California, home to one of the largest populations of Muslims in the United States. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally from Sudan, Massoud holds a law degree, in addition to a Ph.D., from UC Berkeley, which gives him a unique lens to study Islamic culture, history, and law.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who misunderstand or fear Muslims or Islam often do so by portraying shari&#8217;a [pronounced sha-REE-yah] in a distorted way, Massoud said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we only see shari&#8217;a in the narrow sense of legal principles for judges, we miss the subtleties and nuances of the traditions that help guide Muslims making ethical decisions,&#8221; Massoud explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Arabic, shari&#8217;a has linguistic and technical meanings, including &#8216;the path&#8217; or &#8216;the way,&#8217; so many people see it as a path towards leading an ethical life &#8230; an ethical guide to be a good person to yourself, your neighbors, and the environment,&#8221; Massoud said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shari&#8217;a in itself is not a &#8216;legal system&#8217; in the American sense of this concept, not least as shari&#8217;a pre-dates the idea of the nation-state by about a thousand years,&#8221; Massoud said. &#8220;But it is nevertheless a constant reference point for Islamic law.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trained Muslim jurists in various countries still study and interpret the primary sources of shari&#8217;a &#8211; the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith (statements and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) &#8211; to help fellow Muslims make decisions today about ethical behavior, religious practices, and courses of action in their daily lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud&#8217;s talk is timely, considering the rise of Islamophobia in the United States. A recent constitutional referendum in Oklahoma that forbid state judges from considering shari&#8217;a in their rulings was backed by 70 percent of voters. Although it was struck down by a federal court in 2013, many other states followed Oklahoma&#8217;s lead by enacting similar legislative bans on shari&#8217;a. For Massoud, this raises the question, &#8220;How do you ban an ethical or legal system, and how do Muslims respond to this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I learned how American Muslims, facing widespread fear of Islam, have educated themselves and others about faith, rights, and race to practice ethical citizenship,&#8221; Massoud said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muslims in California, Massoud reports, are educating themselves on what shari&#8217;a means so that they can educate others about the Islamic grounds for just, ethical, and environmental living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud appreciates the chance to share his work with diverse audiences. &#8220;Whether teaching students or speaking with alumni, scholars, and members of the informed public, one always must make one&#8217;s work accessible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Being able to study, learn, and share is a blessing.

<p>This first phase, which applies to all sites using the Web Content Management System (WCMS), will introduce official UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://communications.ucsc.edu/visual-design/color/">brand colors</a> and <a href="https://communications.ucsc.edu/visual-design/typography/">fonts</a> to web properties for the first time. In addition to the primary blue and gold colors, the new look will use the secondary color palette which serves to highlight key information areas.</p>
<p>This refresh does not include any structural changes and does not remove any existing features of your webpages. The changes will be done automatically with no site manager action needed.</p>
<p>The campus homepage will have a &#8220;Feedback&#8221; button for a few weeks after the launch so visitors can submit comments. There is also always a <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/feedback/index.html">feedback link</a> in the footer of all WCMS pages which site owners monitor closely. The visual refresh can be <a href="https://www-preview-stage.ucsc.edu">previewed online</a>.</p>
<p>The changes follow a comprehensive evaluation of UC Santa Cruz website and have been done with support of the UC Santa Cruz Web Leadership Team, which is co-chaired by Keith Brant, vice chancellor for University Relations, and Brad Smith, vice chancellor for Information Technology Services.</p>
<p>The Web Advisory Committee which includes academic, college, and administrative members, and the Web Users Group were consulted on the refresh.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will start a more holistic web redesign process in spring with the aim to roll out with a new architecture late in the calendar year. The goal is to support two critical shifts in web strategy.</p>
<p>First, a modular design will allow site managers to customize their websites using content blocks for more layout flexibility. Second, a modular design will allow the campus to update each module as needed, moving away from having to revamp all websites every 5&#8211;7 years.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="448dda9e8072701777aa9bf81eb093f4"><name>sea-stars</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine researchers say recent sea star wasting disease epidemic defies prediction</title><summary>Some sea star communities on the west coast could recover, but marine scientists still can’t pinpoint the environmental factors behind the unprecedented disease outbreak.</summary><keywords>Melissa Miner, Pete Raimondi</keywords><start-date>1521568800000</start-date><display-name>Marine researchers say recent sea star wasting disease epidemic defies prediction</display-name><path>/2018/03/sea-stars</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/sea-stars</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1521568568918</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1521569718856</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Aylin Woodward</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/ochre-star-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/ochre-star-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ochre-star-400.jpg</name><display-name>ochre-star-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>178813</file-size><width>400</width><height>533</height></image><image-alt>diseased sea star</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/03/images/ochre-star-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/03/images/ochre-star-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ochre-star-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ochre-star-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26493</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>diseased sea star</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p class="western">The white lesions on the arms of this sea star are the first sign of sea star wasting syndrome.

Over a matter of months, many sea star species died in record-breaking numbers, though </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Pisaster ochraceus</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">&#8212;a keystone species known as the ochre sea star&#8212;was among the hardest hit. Now, researchers at UC Santa Cruz have analyzed just how much the populations of this species have declined, but they have not yet determined what factors might be contributing to the epidemic.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Scientists aren&#8217;t sure what causes this disease, known as sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS). Some researchers think the culprit could be a viral pathogen, but evidence is inconclusive. Early signs of SSWS include lesions and tissue decay, which can spread along the sea stars&#8217; arms, leading to limb loss and eventual death, often in a matter of days. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Melissa Miner, a researcher in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UC Santa Cruz who is based in Bellingham, Washington, recounted that she had been observing sea stars in a local intertidal zone there during the summer of 2014. &#8220;I went back two weeks later, and it was just death,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The intertidal area was littered with stars, and probably 90 percent of them were dead or dying.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Unprecedented</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">While similar SSWS outbreaks were documented in southern California in the 1970s, &#8217;80s, and &#8217;90s, this most recent epidemic is unprecedented in its scale and scope. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been monitoring sea star populations for a long time, but this event is far broader in geographic scale than anything we&#8217;ve seen before,&#8221; Miner said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This latest outbreak extended from as far south as Baja California, Mexico, all the way to the southern shores of Alaska, according to Peter Raimondi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences. Raimondi is a principle investigator for the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/pacificrockyintertidal/index.html"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network, or MARINe</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, a consortium of 18 research groups that monitor and collect data from more than 200 intertidal sites along the west coast.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In a new study <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192870">published March 20 in </a></span><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192870"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>PLOS One</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, Miner, Raimondi, and colleagues analyzed MARINe data collected between 2000 and 2016 from 90 intertidal sites on the North American Pacific coast to determine the impacts of SSWS on ochre sea star populations and try to understand what factors may have contributed to this most recent SSWS outbreak.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The data revealed that, while ochre sea star populations shrank in all coastal areas, sites in southern California and the Channel Islands experienced more severe declines than those farther north. In the south, adult sea stars declined by 99 percent or more at over half of the 39 sites surveyed, whereas only two sites in the north experienced similar levels of decline. Miner&#8217;s group also noted that juvenile sea star mortality in the period after the initial outbreak of SSWS increased by approximately 90 percent compared to pre-outbreak levels.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Keystone predators</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Ochre sea stars are keystone predators in intertidal ecosystems&#8212;the part of the shore area submerged at high tide and uncovered at low tide&#8212;preying on organisms like the California mussel. When ochre stars are removed, mussel beds can expand, leaving less space for other organisms to flourish in those habitats. A decline in ochre sea stars could lead to a change in the make-up of intertidal communities on the west coast, although other factors are also at play, Miner said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Unfortunately, the data didn&#8217;t yield any clues about which factors might be contributing to SSWS in these different regions. A common culprit in many marine disease events is warm water. Past SSWS events were often correlated with El Ni&#241;o events and their associated periods of warm water, but that was not the case with the 2013 outbreak. According to Miner, elevated sea water temperatures weren&#8217;t linked to the initial emergence of the disease on a broad scale, but may have exacerbated its impact in the period that followed. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Another factor that researchers consider when trying to predict the spread of a disease is the density of the affected populations in different areas. &#8220;In areas where animals are packed closer together, it&#8217;s generally more likely a disease will spread,&#8221; Miner said. But her group didn&#8217;t see that pattern for ochre sea stars. In fact, the outer coast of Washington&#8212;one of the regions with some of the highest densities of stars&#8212;was among the least impacted by SSWS.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">No smoking gun</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Because scientists haven&#8217;t found any &#8220;smoking guns&#8221; behind the disease, and factors that frequently influence the emergence and severity of marine disease events, like temperature and population density, did not correlate with this outbreak, it is difficult to address the epidemic, Miner said. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Without information to support or discount certain environmental factors, we can&#8217;t even begin to prescribe potential solutions,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">According to Miner, the epidemic that started in late 2013 is still ongoing, though the major population crashes noted in 2014 and 2015 have since leveled off. &#8220;I&#8217;d want to see current population levels persist for another six months or so before saying this disease event is over,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Miner is now looking to the future. She thinks that prospects for ochre sea star population recovery are uncertain. If current trends hold, however, recovery will occur fastest in northern regions, where more juveniles are recruiting and appear to be surviving to adulthood following the disease outbreak. &#8220;My guess is southern California regions will take a lot longer to recover,&#8221; she said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/11/sea-star-disease.html</url><title>Marine scientists track spread of sea star wasting disease</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/11/sea-star-virus.html</url><title>Virus identified as top suspect in sea star wasting disease</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="449a2c278072701777aa9bf8c933db04"><name>us-news-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz graduate programs rank among best in nation in U.S. News survey</title><summary>The U.S. News and World Report's 2019 Best Graduate Schools guide evaluates graduate schools in business, education, engineering, law, medicine, nursing, social work, criminology, public affairs, and the sciences.&#13;

The project includes graduate student housing and continuing undergraduate housing, which will be built on a site off of Heller Drive. The project also includes a new family student housing community and child care facility, which will be open to students and employees, on a site near the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge Drives.</p>
<p>Student Housing West is critical in addressing the demand for housing and helps to support student success. It uses a public-private partnership (P3) model, where the facilities will be financed using tax exempt bonds. The student experience will be seamless with that of current campus housing. The residence life program will be provided by the same campus team that supports existing housing on campus. The first beds at the Hagar site are scheduled to come online in fall 2019, with the entire project slated for completion in fall 2022.</p>

<h3 id="faq_1">What was the origin of the Student Housing West project?</h3>
<p>The Student Housing West project originated from the West Campus Planning Study conducted in 2014&#8211;15. The planning committee, which consisted of faculty, staff and students, for this study was charged with examining housing west of Heller Drive to determine feasible projects that could add beds, address facility needs at Kresge College, and address the facility renewal needs of family student housing and child care. However, projects designed to add the number of beds needed by the campus under the existing 2005 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) and also address family student housing renewal were not financially feasible due to debt capacity limitations of the campus.</p>
<p>(More information on this study is <a href="https://mediafiles.ucsc.edu/ppc/studies/11125Housing.pdf">available online</a>.)</p>
<p>When UC President Janet Napolitano launched the <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/student-housing-initiative/">new systemwide student housing initiative</a> in 2016, a feasible path forward emerged. UC Santa Cruz was able to benefit from a public-private partnership model that would provide the number of beds needed while also providing a financially feasible model to accomplish the project. An additional housing project - Kresge College renewal and expansion - is also underway, though it will not be delivered using a public-private partnership model.</p>
<h3 id="faq_2">How has student input been incorporated in the Student Housing West project?</h3>
<p>Students were included on the original 2014&#8211;15 Student Housing West study. In addition, when the project expanded and evolved after the P3 model was selected, the campus used student surveys and student panels to guide initial planning. Each development team vying to be selected to partner with the campus on the project used the survey results and the panels in developing their initial proposals. Students were also included in the developer review committee that conducted charrettes over the summer of 2017 and interviewed developers for Student Housing West. Since the developer, Capstone Development Partners, was selected in September 2017, the campus has utilized a variety of student forums and a student advisory committee to provide feedback as plans develop.</p>
<h3 id="faq_3">Is it true that the developer will own the facilities?</h3>
<p>The developer will not own the facilities and does not serve as the landlord for the development. The facilities will be owned by a third-party non-profit, <a href="https://collegiatehousing.org/chf-announces-partnership-with-university-of-california-system/">Collegiate Housing Foundation</a>. At the end of the agreement, ownership of the buildings will revert from the non-profit back to the campus.</p>
<h3 id="faq_4">Is the developer financing the project?</h3>
<p>The developer is not financing the project. The project is financed by using tax exempt bonds.</p>
<h3 id="faq_5">Won't the developer retain all the rental profits from the housing, and therefore don&#8217;t they have an incentive to escalate rental rates?</h3>
<p>Capstone Development Partners receives a set fee to develop the project. This fee is equivalent to what developers would earn in more traditional delivery models, such as design-build (the same contractor is responsible for design and construction) or design-bid-build (one contractor designs the project and produces the bid documents and another contractor is responsible for the construction). Capstone Management Partners, will operate and maintain the facilities and will receive a fee to do so. Once the project opens, revenues remaining after all fixed costs flow back to the campus and not the developer or operator.</p>
<h3 id="faq_6">What is to prevent the developer from increasing rental rates in an effort to increase their profit?</h3>
<p>As part of the model being used, the rental rates are set in conjunction with the campus and will not be higher than campus rates. Annual rental rates will be set between the campus and the non-profit owner, Collegiate Housing Foundation.</p>
<h3 id="faq_7">How can you ensure quality in the buildings being constructed?</h3>
<p>The campus developed a set of performance specifications that the developer must abide by to ensure quality. In addition, the campus architect remains the building official for the construction and compliance with California Codes, and campus technical staff review the project at given milestones for compliance with technical requirements, performance specifications and campus policies.</p>
<h3>Even if the project is constructed well, what is to prevent it from not being maintained at an adequate level? If the buildings are not maintained well, then the campus will get back buildings that have no useful life left.</h3>
<p>The campus has developed a set of key performance indicators that the operator must meet. If those performance goals are not met, then their fee is deducted. In addition, capital reserves are put aside every year to address building major maintenance.</p>
<h3 id="faq_8">Will the facilities be sustainable and support the campus&#8217;s aggressive sustainability goals?</h3>
<p>The goal of the Student Housing West project is to deliver buildings that are LEED Platinum.</p>
<p>The facilities must comply with the UC Sustainable Practices Policy Section IIIA, which includes outperforming the California Building Code energy-efficiency standards by at least 20 percent or meeting aggressive whole-building energy performance targets, as well as achieving a minimum of LEED Silver certification.</p>
<p>(More information on the UC Sustainable Practices policy <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3100155/Sustainable%20Practices">can be found online</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="faq_9">If the project was originally envisioned to be developed in the west, then why is part of the program now being sited at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge?</h3>
<p>At the outset of the project, the campus initially reviewed sites west of Heller Drive, examining different configurations and sitings for the project. As a result of the current 2005 Long Range Development Plan and subsequent Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, the campus agreed that housing development in the area west of Porter College would be initiated before development of new bed spaces in the North Campus Area. Over the years the campus carried out its due diligence on environmental and ecological conditions on the potential sites west of Porter College. After the original project boundary was established, the need to sensitively manage species habitats resulted in a smaller developable footprint.</p>
<p>As a result, the campus had to examine different configurations and site locations on the western side of campus. These options compromised the appropriate scale and adjacencies for different student populations. Therefore, the campus needed to examine options for breaking up the development on other sites. Campus planners considered many factors in evaluating alternate options, including the feasibility of the options from a programmatic, cost, environmental, and schedule framework. Moving the family student housing units and the child care facility to the eastern portion of campus near the entry and close to employee housing emerged as the best solution. It ensures the scale of development is appropriate for students with families, addresses the environmental sensitivities at the Heller site, co-locates child care with family student housing, provides access to child care near the entrance of campus, and places child care close to employee housing to provide access for those employees who have children enrolled in the center. It also builds upon prior studies done by the campus that suggested locating child care near the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge Drives would be beneficial for access.</p>
<h3 id="faq_10">Did the developers pick the Hagar site?</h3>
<p>During the request for proposals (RFP) selection process Capstone Development Partners proposed an option to site Family Student Housing and Child Care at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge Drives in order to address the issues that could arise with a smaller site boundary for development in the west. While this site was suggested due to its designation as Campus Resource Land in the 2005 LRDP, the developer did not select the site. Site selection was made by the campus after exploring several alternate options.</p>
<h3 id="faq_11">Did you seek any feedback on the Hagar and Coolidge site and who made the decision to select this site?</h3>
<p>After reviewing site alternatives identified by the campus planners including that suggested by the development team, Chancellor George Blumenthal and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp made the decision to move forward with siting family student housing and child care at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge Drives. Before their decision was final, presentations were made to the Administrative Leadership Team, Senate Leadership, the Academic Senate Committee of Planning and Budget, and the Committee on Campus Planning and Stewardship. Their feedback, as well as the feedback from those who had served on the developer evaluation team, was shared with the chancellor and executive vice chancellor. In addition, feedback from current residents in Family Student Housing, who reviewed the programmatic impact of siting their units at the west site versus an alternative site were also shared with campus leadership.</p>
<h3 id="faq_12">Are you building towers in the meadow?</h3>
<p>No, the facilities being developed at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge are designed to support the programmatic needs of students with families and the child care needs of students and employees. No building is higher than two stories, and the buildings are being designed as four apartments in a grouping.</p>
<h3 id="faq_13">Are you developing in protected landscape?</h3>
<p>The proposed development is not being built on land designated as Protected Landscape in the 2005 Long Range Development Plan. The project is sited on land designated as Campus Resource Land (CRL). Campus Resource Land is a land-use designation assigned to lands that are not planned for development under the 2005 LRDP. It was envisioned that these lands would be maintained in their natural state to serve as long-term reserve lands for future use but that, if development was desired by the campus, proposed projects would seek an LRDP amendment and conduct additional environmental reviews. Based on the decision to site the Family Student Housing portion of the project at this location, the campus is conducting additional environmental reviews and will seek an LRDP amendment to change the designation from CRL to Colleges Student Housing (CSH).</p>
<h3 id="faq_14">Why is current family student housing being replaced and was that a last minute decision?</h3>
<p>Replacement of family student housing was always part of the program for Student Housing West. Current facilities are past their useful age and the current site can accommodate a much higher density. Higher density development minimizes building footprints which leaves more land in its natural state.</p>
<h3 id="faq_15">How have you communicated information about the project?</h3>
<p>The campus has communicated information about the project through multiple open forums, a <a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/studenthousingwest/index.html">website</a>, Tuesday Newsday, notices from Public Affairs, and social media.</p>
<h3 id="faq_16">How did you communicate about the change in siting to Hagar and Coolidge?</h3>
<p>The siting adjustment was shared in late October 2017 at stakeholder sessions for Family Student Housing, graduate students, undergraduate students, and residents living in employee housing. It was also communicated in <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/update-student-housing-west.html?utm_source=10-31-2017&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=tuesday-newsday">Tuesday Newsday</a>, the weekly newsletter sent to faculty, staff, and students. It was also communicated through Public Affairs with the release of a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/scoping-student-housing.html">revised notice of preparation for a draft Environmental Impact Report</a> (EIR) scoping session announcement. In addition, the campus held open forums for the entire campus community where the change was mapped out in the presentation. The campus also held two Alumni Forums, which were accessible in person or online to accommodate alums who were out of the area. The mechanisms used to advertise forums and stakeholder sessions ranged from email, Public Affairs notices, social media, table tents in dining facilities, and announcements in the City on the Hill newspaper and the Santa Cruz Sentinel. Since October, campus representatives have also made presentations in the community outlining the siting and the evolution to two sites. The project was also the focus of a <a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20171211/NEWS/171219955">front-page story</a> in the Santa Cruz Sentinel in December.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4a278ab88072701777aa9bf811cc47fe"><name>message-shw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Making difficult choices to provide campus housing</title><summary>Today, the state finds itself in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis.

We take great pride in our stunning natural environment. Within the context of this beautiful setting, we must weigh carefully the needs of our students against the concerns that come with any construction project.</p>
<p>Today, the state finds itself in the midst of an unprecedented housing crisis. In our own community, there is a lack of housing, and what is available is prohibitively expensive and in some instances simply unsafe. As campus leaders, we have developed bold plans to try to help our students&#8212;plans that will also aid the greater community.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, we announced we were embarking on an ambitious plan to provide significantly more on-campus housing options for our current students. While we currently house about 53 percent of our undergraduate students, we are seeking to build housing to support thousands more. What we&#8217;re calling Student Housing West will also allow us to ease overcrowding in existing dorms, and to restore some of the lounge space we have converted to sleeping space in recent years to meet serious need.</p>
<p>All told, Student Housing West (SHW) will provide about 3,000 beds, which we believe will pull students who are now in the local housing market back to campus, easing pressure on the greater community&#8217;s housing needs. SHW is currently the single largest housing project underway in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>We anticipate breaking ground on the project this summer and completing it by fall 2022.</p>
<p>The project has several components. New housing for upper-division undergraduates and graduate students will be built at the current location of Family Student Housing.</p>
<p>Our Family Student Housing program&#8212;designed to support the unique needs of students who are also raising children&#8212;will be relocated to 12.5 acres at Hagar and Coolidge drives, across the street from existing employee housing. An expanded child care facility, designed to serve faculty, staff, and students, will also go there. This Hagar site has raised concern among some members of our campus community.</p>
<p>Choosing this location, after seeking feedback from administrative and faculty leadership, was not an easy decision. Our initial plan was to build the entire SHW project on the west side of campus. A preliminary environmental review, however, revealed significant challenges with the westside location that would have entailed a much longer timeline, with no certainty of a positive outcome, both of which would have seriously negative impacts on our students and the Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>We considered several alternate sites for housing, but other constraints made those spots infeasible.</p>
<p>This Hagar location makes sense for a number of reasons: It is near existing employee housing, and it&#8217;s close to the main campus entrance, making it easy for parents to drop off children.</p>
<p>The site was also designated as Campus Resource Land in our 2005 LRDP, while large swaths of meadow to the north were set aside as protected landscapes. The LRDP envisioned Campus Resource Lands being maintained in their natural state for future use, requiring additional environmental review and an LRDP amendment if development were proposed. The efforts associated with environmental review and the amendment are underway.</p>
<p>While we understand the concerns, we carefully thought about the best path forward to meet the needs of our campus.</p>
<p>By university standards, this project is moving fast. But the longer we wait, the more construction costs escalate, and these costs are ultimately borne by our students. In the meantime, students will continue to struggle to find safe and affordable housing in the overheated local rental market.</p>
<p>Deciding to build anywhere on our iconic campus is difficult&#8212;and we have faced similar scrutiny in the past when proposing projects. Sites are not chosen hastily or without deliberation. We look to continue our tradition of building respectfully. As with all campus buildings, architects will design the complex to blend in with the natural landscape.</p>
<p>All development on campus is a balancing act. We remain committed to respecting our unique landscape, while also serving the needs of our students and helping them confront the real and immediate challenges they face, particularly in regard to housing.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen great results with our prioritization survey, with 616 individuals responding: 273 faculty, 211 staff, 80 undergraduates and 52 graduate students. The survey polled the campus on the most important criteria by which to assess the proposals that emerge from our Themed Academic Working Groups. Faculty, staff, and students showed remarkable alignment in their desire to promote research areas &#8220;addressing a big societal issue or challenge with the potential to have a real-world impact&#8221; and ones that are &#8220;multidisciplinary with the potential to engage many members of the campus community.&#8221; These two criteria enjoyed the strongest support.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis illustrates breakdowns along divisional lines and roles. Faculty and students in Engineering rated the &#8220;potential to generate resources&#8221; as the single most important factor. The same groups in Arts and Humanities assessed &#8220;resource generation&#8221; much lower and emphasized the importance of &#8220;advancing diversity in research and teaching.&#8221; Physical and Biological Sciences deemed nothing more important than &#8220;areas in which the campus already has strength or is recognized,&#8221; while Social Sciences responses were close to the average with noticeable spikes emphasizing &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;areas in which UC Santa Cruz can make a unique contribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faculty rated the criteria &#8220;in an area in which the campus already has strength or is recognized&#8221; almost as highly as they rated &#8220;multidisciplinary.&#8221; The responses of undergraduate and graduate students closely tracked with faculty and staff for the top-rated criteria, but undergraduates also highly valued &#8220;resource generation&#8221; and &#8220;innovations in teaching and learning,&#8221; while grad students stressed the importance of &#8220;advancing diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ACZbin3wkiS_NZB2WCZe7TQSABkA5fu6/view">Here is a snapshot</a> of our preliminary results. A copy of the survey is <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/comms-reports.html">available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Themed Groups</h3>
<p>The CP/EVC&#8217;s staff set up 60 initial meetings for Themed Academic Working Groups on Wednesday through Friday of last week. The groups came together to begin (or continue) conversations on how they could effectively collaborate on shared research interests and advance the research and teaching mission of the university. We look forward to seeing the final reports the groups produce by the April 19 deadline. For more information on the timeline for submission and review of the proposals, visit the <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/get-involved.html">SAP website</a>.</p>
<p>While the themed groups have occupied much attention over the past month, it&#8217;s important to bear in mind they are only one aspect of a larger planning process. At the upcoming Future State Design workshops, we will talk about advancing diversity, preparing students for the job market, student success, sustainability, and other issues of paramount importance to the campus. See below for more details.</p>
<h3>Upcoming</h3>
<p>We will host an-all campus Future State Design workshop on Tuesday, March 20, from 1:30&#8211;5 p.m. in 108 Digital Arts Research Center. The workshop will ask participants to suggest, refine, and debate the &#8220;design principles&#8221; that will guide our trajectory over the next five years. Design principles are clear, tightly defined guidelines that identify a set of institutional aspirations. So, for example, some potential design principles might include: &#8220;Drive research and creative work that transforms our world,&#8221; and &#8220;Prepare students to make an impact in a changing world.&#8221; Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwpapcOVSm5irRpQQjwqHgHgv43BqSiARYydmShIO2Mlnybg/closedform">register</a> by Thursday, March 15, to join the conversation.</p>

<p><a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/studenthousingwest/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;our effort to further increase on-campus housing for our existing students&#8212;is entering the next stage of project review.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we released the project&#8217;s draft environmental impact report, which is available </span><a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/planning/EnvDoc.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for review and comment. This document is an in-depth analysis of the project, its impacts, and the ways we're going to reduce them.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West&#8212;spread over two sites, Heller Drive and Hagar Drive&#8212;will provide housing for 3,000 students. Most of the new housing units will support upper division undergraduates and graduate students at the Heller Drive site, though the project will also create new housing for students with families on Hagar Drive as well as a child care center that will serve campus employees, in addition to students. &#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student experience will be seamless with the residence life program provided by the team that supports existing housing on campus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The design and programming of Student Housing West has been guided by student preferences and needs, feedback gained through our project student advisory council, campus forums, and town hall meetings, as well as housing surveys and review with various campus groups. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are hosting two meetings to provide more information about the project and to offer our campus community, agencies, and the public an opportunity to provide oral comments on the draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR).</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first meeting will be from 6:30&#8211;8:30 p.m. May 2 at the Louden Nelson Community Center, 301 Center St., Santa Cruz, Ca. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second meeting will be 5&#8211;7 p.m. May 3 at Hotel Paradox, 611 Ocean St., Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we close the review period May 11, we will respond to the comments and revise our EIR as appropriate. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect to have Student Housing West, including the final </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIR and an amendment to our 2005 Long-Range Development plan, before the UC Board of Regents for approval in July with construction set to start in September. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project will be done in phases with construction scheduled for completion by fall 2022. It is currently the largest housing project in all of Santa Cruz County. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many studies have shown living on campus is an important element in the success of university students. Being immersed in a campus environment helps foster student engagement and a sense of community, all of which helps in the retention of students as they progress toward degree completion.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have an obligation to ensure adequate on-campus housing for our current and future students&#8212;particularly as we confront an unprecedented statewide housing crisis that is directly impacting our students. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West is one step in the right direction. It will both provide support and relief to our students, and by extension free up some room in the local housing market.

<p>Tsunami Preparedness Week&#8212;March 26&#8211;30&#8212;is a good time to learn about the risks to your work, recreational, and residential communities.</p>
<p>Cal OES Tsunami <a href="http://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/geologic_hazards/Tsunami/Documents/TsunamiBrochure.pdf">brochure</a></p>
<p><strong>Santa Cruz risk levels: U.S. West Coast: High to Very High</strong></p>
<p>The West Coast states of Washington, Oregon, and California have experienced tsunamis from as far away as Alaska, South America, Japan, and Russia. The most damaging on record is the tsunami caused by the 1964 Great Alaska earthquake. More recently, harbors in the region were damaged by events in Japan (2011) and Chile (2010).</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between a tsunami watch, advisory and warning?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Watch - A tsunami watch means that a distant tsunami is possible.</li>
<li>Advisory &#8211; Strong currents and waves dangerous to those in or near the water possible</li>
<li>Warning &#8211; Dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all instances, stay alert to changing conditions and tuned into media for more information.</p>
<p><strong>How long do I have to respond and evacuate before a tsunami?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the origination of the earthquake, it may be a few hours to just 15&#8211;20 minutes before the surge reaches the coast.</p>
<p><strong>How should I respond during a tsunami?</strong></p>
<p>Immediately evacuate tsunami threat zones and move to higher ground; 100 feet above sea level or 2 miles inland.</p>
<p>The University of California, Santa Cruz&#8217;s main campus is approximately 388 feet above sea level at the base of the campus and nearly 1,000 feet above sea level at the top of the campus.</p>
<p><strong>Warning signs of a tsunami</strong></p>
<p>Shaky ground, the ocean receding unusually and a loud ocean roar could mean a tsunami is coming.</p>

But actress Adilah Barnes takes it all in her stride.</article-subhead><article-text><p>From working in theater at the prestigious American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco to appearing with&#160;<strong>Julia Roberts</strong>&#160;in the landmark film&#160;<em>Erin&#160;Brockovich</em>, Ms. Barnes&#8217; career has been extensive spanning theater, film, television, education, and writing.</p>
<p>Barnes also has been very active as a UC Santa Cruz alumna and was named one of&#160;UCSC&#8217;s Most Influential Alumni, served on the elected Alumni Council, and has helped numerous students as a member of&#160;UCSC&#8217;s Career Advice Network. Her many awards over the years include the&#160;<em>Winona Fletcher Award for Outstanding Achievement&#160;and Artistic Excellence in&#160;Theatre</em>, being honored with the&#160;<em>Adilah&#160;Barnes&#160;Arts and Literary Achievement Scholarship</em>&#160;for inner-city youth in Minneapolis, and being the first African-American woman inducted into the&#160;<em>Hall of Fame</em>&#160;in her hometown of&#160;Oroville, California.</p>
<p>In 2017, Barnes was honored, along with the Los Angeles&#160;Theatre&#160;Festival, which she co-founded, at the Inner City Cultural Center&#8217;s 50<sup>th</sup>&#160;anniversary in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Currently, Barnes is on campus working with students from&#160;UCSC&#8217;s African American Theater Arts Troupe in their production of the groundbreaking play&#160;<em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>&#160;by Lorraine Hansberry, where she is playing the role of&#160;Mama. The play, directed by Don Williams, is being produced by the&#160;UCSC&#160;Theater Arts Department, the&#160;UCSC&#160;Arts Division, and The Cultural Arts and Diversity Resource Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;After Ms. Barnes was the keynote speaker for the 25<sup>th</sup>&#160;anniversary celebration of the African American Theater Arts Troupe, director Don Williams and I formed a spark of an idea to cast Ms. Barnes in the role of Mama,&#8221; said Dean of the Arts Susan&#160;Solt. &#8220;And how wonderful that she jumped in wholeheartedly to make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;What better way to celebrate the UC Santa Cruz Year of the Alumni than having one of our most successful and beloved alums back with us to teach our students, share her mastery of her craft, and to challenge and inspire us to think about issues of race, class, and culture?&#8221;</p>
<h3>Sowing the seed that would later become her destiny</h3>
<p>Barnes&#8217; very first acting role was the Queen in A.A. Milne&#8217;s play&#160;<em>The Ugly Duckling</em>&#160;when she had just finished her sophomore year in high school. That summer she was selected to be part of Project Upward Bound, a U.S. Department of Education program which prepares students for college with special courses. The part unwittingly sowed the seed that would later become her destiny.</p>
<p>Barnes had never taken a drama class and thought it would be intriguing to try something new. &#8220;Everyone was cast based on their ability and not their ethnicity,&#8221; she recalls. &#8220;And that&#8217;s how I was cast. So it was a very empowering way to start as an actor. It was multi-cultural&#8230;the person who played my husband was Anglo, our daughter was blonde, her suitor was African-American&#8230;so I began in theater thinking that anything was possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a young girl growing up in the rural Northern California town of&#160;Oroville, Barnes lived in a close-knit community. &#8220;Oroville&#160;was like a little Southern town that had been airlifted and dropped in the Sacramento Valley,&#8221; she says. &#8220;There were first and second-generation Southerners who brought all of their sensibilities. We had a strong sense of our African-American community on the Southside, but there also were those from the area who lived on the other side of town with different perspectives around race and culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Living in that kind of separatism also taught Barnes the immense value of having to create your necessities. &#8220;We had our own barbers, our own grocery stores and hairdressers&#8230;we had everything we needed for our part of town. Oftentimes we felt more comfortable in our community, so that&#8217;s where a lot of my world was, though I comfortably moved between those two worlds.&#8221;</p>
<h3>A diamond in the rough</h3>
<p>At the same time, Barnes displayed an enormous curiosity as a child and was a high achiever, believing that there was nothing she&#160;couldn&#8217;t do. She attributes her confidence to the elders in her community who recognized her intellect and specialness, as well as her elementary school teachers who encouraged her academically, and then the teachers at Upward Bound who nurtured her talent. &#8220;I was like a diamond in the rough. And they really saw something in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>During her first summer at Upward Bound, another fortuitous meeting came about that would greatly impact her life.&#160;<strong>Professor J. Herman Blake</strong>, who was the first African-American professor at the&#160;UCSC&#160;campus, starting there in 1965, and who became the founding provost of Oakes College, was visiting a friend who was an Upward Bound counselor.</p>
<p>The students were on an outdoor field trip and stopped by a stream to swim. Barnes&#160;didn&#8217;t swim and wasn&#8217;t wearing a swim suit, but Professor Blake noticed her not participating and urged her to get in the water anyway. She did and, impressed with her moxie, he talked to her about considering UC Santa Cruz for college and invited her to take a tour of the very young, two-year-old campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz had just opened&#8230;everyone was in trailers,&#8221; remembers Barnes. &#8220;They&#160;didn&#8217;t even have any dorms. There was Cowell and Stevenson and that was it. I remember the ride down very distinctly because I was on a Greyhound bus and was looking around at all of the trees and I said to myself &#8216;Wow!&#8217; especially since&#160;Oroville&#160;was so agricultural with a lot of dirt and dust and fields, and very flat. I just thought&#160;UCSC&#160;was the most lush place I&#8217;d ever seen in my life!&#8221;</p>
<h3>2,400 students at UC Santa Cruz and only 28 were black</h3>
<p>Along with her mentor Professor Blake, what attracted her to the campus was that, instead of giving letter grades, professors evaluated their students with written narratives. She also liked the idea of being at a smaller school where she could really get to know her teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told my high school counselor that I was going to apply to UC Santa Cruz and she responded that Chico State would be a better choice for me. But I told her, &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you understand&#8230;I&#8217;m going to that university. I&#8217;m going to apply there.&#8217; That just shows you that if you don&#8217;t have encouraging counselors, they can clip the wings of students. I wasn&#8217;t about to let her clip mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Barnes&#8217; freshman year at&#160;UCSC, she discovered that there were only 2,400 students on campus with a mere 28 who were Black. The Black students came together as a group and became close friends, supporting each other during an extremely volatile time in history when the Vietnam War, Civil Rights Movement, the Black Panther Party, and hippie movement were all happening at the same time.</p>
<h3>Creating black magic</h3>
<p>Black students also decided to create their own theater group, Black Magic, and performed plays not only on campus, but also in other communities in the area including Seaside and Monterey. &#8220;Black Magic was around as long as the founders were,&#8221; says Barnes. &#8220;We established our own theater group to produce our own plays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another significant time for her at&#160;UCSC&#160;was when she met&#160;<strong>Fernando Arrabal</strong>. The world-renowned Spanish playwright and director was visiting the campus to do a production with students and chose her to be in his play. &#8220;It was incredible! Even the San Francisco Chronicle came down to cover it,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>After graduation, she knew that she wanted to act professionally and moved to San Francisco to do theater. She landed at the esteemed American Conservatory Theater (ACT) where she became the first African American to teach full time in the Advanced Training Program. She did a wide variety of theater in the Bay Area&#8230;classics, contemporary, experimental&#8230;while also working in locally produced industrial films.</p>
<p>Her first television role came about when Bill Duke, a very well respected African-American director, was casting in the Bay Area for a made-for-TV movie called&#160;<em>Johnnie Mae Gibson: FBI</em>. However, a bigger break was yet to come when, while touring in the play&#160;<em>Joe Turner&#8217;s Come and Gone</em>&#160;with ACT in Los Angeles, Barnes started getting film offers. &#8220;After we took the show down there, everyone was coming to see our play and the cast was getting asked to do auditions and to have &#8216;general meetings&#8217; with casting directors&#8230;I got three film roles in three months and knew that the time had come to move to LA.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Working with Julia Roberts in <em>Erin Brockovich</em></h3>
<p>Barnes kept getting work and was cast sight unseen by director Steven Soderbergh to be in his film,&#160;<em>Erin&#160;Brockovich</em>, which starred Julia Roberts. Soderbergh had seen&#160;Adilah&#160;on her demotape submitted by her agent and decided that she&#8217;d be perfect for the role of Anna, who&#8217;s character is in the entire movie.</p>
<p>Barnes also enjoyed working with Julia Roberts. &#8220;She was playful, impish,&#8221; she says. During that time, Roberts was dating actor Benjamin Bratt (who&#8217;s brother Peter is a USCC alumnus and a documentary filmmaker), and she had taught Benjamin in classes at ACT. &#8220;Julia told me that she was going to see Benjamin that weekend, and I told her to tell him to get his butt up here &#8216;cause his teacher&#8217;s here!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she did exactly that. On their final of formal day of shooting, Roberts lead&#160;Adilah&#160;straight to Bratt who was waiting for Roberts on the sidelines. &#8220;When Julia moves on the set, all eyes follow her,&#8221; smiles Barnes. &#8220;When Benjamin saw me, he said quite loudly so everyone could hear: &#8216;This is my teacher!&#8217; And I told him how kind he was&#8230;it was really lovely to work with Julia.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there, more parts rolled in, including a part on the hugely successful television series&#160;<em>Roseanne</em>. Slated to be a returning, recurring character for one episode this abbreviated season, Barnes initially accepted the job over 25 years ago while in the middle of touring nationally for a one-woman show for the African-American Drama Company of San Francisco. Ironically, the first stop for the show was Porter College at UC Santa Cruz, so Barnes performed for old friends and classmates then &#8211; people who had spanned her entire life.</p>
<h3>From one episode to five seasons with <em>Roseanne</em></h3>
<p>While the play was on the East Coast, Barnes had a short break between performance dates and decided to come home to California, which she normally&#160;didn&#8217;t do due to the long distance. But she had a feeling she ought to come home between performances and went with her intuition. As fate would have it, she got a call to audition on the very day she needed to fly back. But the producers assembled at the urging of the casting director so she could still catch her flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen producers and writers scramble for an actor like that&#8230;everyone came together&#8230;&#8221; She read for the part and hopped on a plane to head back East, and then got the call that she&#8217;d been hired. And after doing that one episode of&#160;<em>Roseanne</em>, she got a call from one of the show&#8217;s writers thanking her for her work.</p>
<p>The next thing she knew, her character of Anne Marie was cast for the next five seasons and was given a family. &#8220;The lesson in that is &#8216;listen to your intuition&#8217;, reflects&#160;Adilah. &#8220;Because had I not listened and not come back, I wouldn&#8217;t have been cast in&#160;<em>Roseanne</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the length of her career, along with her theater and film work, Barnes has had numerous roles for major television programs, including&#160;<em>The Middle</em>,&#160;<em>The M Word</em>,&#160;<em>Body of Proof</em>,&#160;<em>Prime Suspect</em>,&#160;<em>Cold Case</em>, and&#160;<em>Gilmore Girls</em>, to name a few. She also has written a book entitled&#160;<em>On My Own Terms: One Actor&#8217;s Journey</em>&#160;that was named #3 in June, 2009 by Essence Magazine behind President Obama&#8217;s two books. She toured throughout 40 states and three continents in her one-woman play&#160;<em>I Am That I Am: Woman, Black</em>, a historical journey into the lives of seven renowned women: Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Mary McLeod Bethune, Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Angela Davis and Maya Angelou.</p>
<p>Barnes is also the co-founder of the Los Angeles Women&#8217;s&#160;Theatre&#160;Festival, an annual multicultural solo festival now in its 25<sup>th</sup>&#160;year, and is the proprietor of the Writer&#8217;s Well, an international literary retreat for women in Sharpsburg, Georgia with guests from as far away as Ghana and Puerto Rico.</p>
<h3>"If a role has your name on it, you're going to get it"</h3>
<p>When offering advice to students who want to become actors, Barnes tells them to &#8220;train, train, train,&#8221; and to always be ready. She stresses how important it is to learn your craft, give it your best, maintain your integrity and to not take things personally.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really believe that if a role is for you and your name is on it, you&#8217;re going to get it,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If your name is not on it, somebody else&#8217;s name is on it, but your turn is surely to come around again.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example, Barnes tells of when she was auditioning to be in a film with Whoopie Goldberg and, due to her being in a play in ACT at the time,&#160;couldn&#8217;t make it from San Francisco to the audition in San Jose, so the casting director scheduled her for another day and time. But when she started to drive to the audition, her car&#8217;s fuel injectors acted up, preventing her from making it. When she called the agent to let her know, she said that it was unlikely she&#8217;d get another time to audition. When she found out that they had cast someone else, she released the role.</p>
<p>But then Barnes was called again because the shooting schedule had changed and the actor&#160;couldn&#8217;t take the role, so she was able to make the audition the third time around. She rented a car this time to make sure nothing would go wrong!</p>
<p>&#8220;When I went onto the set, I saw Whoopie (who I knew before she met fame) and she said &#8216;What are&#160;<em>you</em>&#160;doing here?!&#8217;, reminiscences Barnes . &#8220;I told her that I was there to audition for the part of her mother. Whoopi said, &#8216;Oh, we&#8217;re going to have to talk about this later&#8217;. And I said &#8216;Oh, we can talk about it right&#160;<em>now</em>!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The moral of that story is that the role came back for me&#160;<em>three</em>&#160;times. It had my name on it&#8230;and they aged me with hair and make-up for the part!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnes also advises acting students to be very mindful of the roles they take and be aware that every role they agree to is building their resume. She cautions against accepting any part, especially at the beginning of one&#8217;s career, with the excuse that it&#8217;s okay to do&#160;<em>anything</em>&#160;because you need the experience, credits, and the work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that every role you take from the beginning, you&#8217;re building an image,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So the question is what kind of image do you want to build?&#8221;</p>
<h3>"A lot of roles I played were not written for African-American women"</h3>
<p>Barnes also acknowledges that there are not nearly as many roles as there ought to be for older woman, and especially women of color, but it is getting better. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had an interesting career because a lot of roles that I&#8217;ve played were not really written for African-American women. I&#8217;ve also been very selective about the roles I&#8217;ve chosen. Integrity has always been very important to me in my career and my life. And as a result, there have been roles that I passed on because I just simply refused to do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barnes talks about many of her inspiring personal experiences in her book&#160;<strong><em>On My Own Terms: One Actor&#8217;s Journey</em></strong>, including the time when she unexpectedly ended up performing a poem in front of her idol Sidney Poitier. &#8220;Like I said,&#160;<em>always</em>&#160;be ready!&#8221; she chuckles.</p>
<p>As rehearsals for&#160;<em>A Raisin In the Sun</em>&#160;continue, Barnes has been thrilled to work with the students and looks forward to when the play opens. She also hopes to return to&#160;UCSC&#160;in the future to do more educational projects and teach a class that focuses on the first wave of African-American students who were the trail blazers on campus when it first opened, many of whom who have gone on to very successful careers.</p>
<h3>"<em>A Raisin In the Sun</em> is one of my all-time favorite timeless classics"</h3>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to have been invited to come back to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Being a cast member of UCSC's production of&#160;<em>A Raisin in the Sun</em>&#160;is heartwarming for me on many levels. First on all, the play is one of my all-time favorite timeless classics. I adore Lorraine Hansberry, who I also portray and give homage to in my solo show,&#160;<em>I Am That I Am: Woman, Black</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, returning to&#160;UCSC&#160;in this capacity leading a cast of students is a learning experience for all of us, not to mention working with director Don Williams whom I have worked with in different capacities for many years. Thirdly, I portrayed the daughter character of&#160;Beneatha&#160;many years ago and welcome growing into playing the wise and powerful role of&#160;Mama&#160;at this time around in my career. I am deeply humbled by this&#160;UCSC&#160;opportunity to work on stage again."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6cfed327807270177653ce7834ec2f98"><name>brian-kavanaugh-jones-passionate-about-the-arts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From Student Artist to Hollywood Producer, Alumnus Brian Kavanaugh-Jones Has Always Been Passionate About the Arts</title><summary>From his passion for the arts and accompanying his father on travels around the globe, to his keen enthusiasm for collaboration and bringing outstanding creative projects to fruition, it’s no wonder that Brian was destined to become such a successful Hollywood film producer.</summary><start-date>1520013600000</start-date><display-name>From Student Artist to Hollywood Producer, Alumnus Brian Kavanaugh-Jones Has Always Been Passionate About the Arts</display-name><path>/2018/03/brian-kavanaugh-jones-passionate-about-the-arts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/03/brian-kavanaugh-jones-passionate-about-the-arts</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1535131964151</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1535142882380</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Maureen Dixon Harrison</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/brian-kavanaugh-jones.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/brian-kavanaugh-jones.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brian-kavanaugh-jones.jpg</name><display-name>brian-kavanaugh-jones.jpg</display-name><file-size>83211</file-size><width>400</width><height>266</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Brian Kavanaugh-Jones</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/brian-kavanaugh-jones-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/brian-kavanaugh-jones-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brian-kavanaugh-jones-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>brian-kavanaugh-jones-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18756</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Brian Kavanaugh-Jones</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/shana-feste.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/shana-feste.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shana-feste.jpg</name><display-name>shana-feste.jpg</display-name><file-size>60053</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Shana Feste</image-alt><image-caption>Shana Feste</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Growing up in the rural town of&#160;Petaluma,&#160;UCSC&#160;Arts Division alumnus&#160;<strong>Brian&#160;Kavanaugh-Jones</strong>&#160;grew up appreciating the culture and beauty of California while also experiencing what the outside world had to offer.</p>
<p>From his passion for the arts and accompanying his father on travels around the globe, to his keen enthusiasm for collaboration and bringing outstanding creative projects to fruition, it&#8217;s no wonder that Brian was destined to become such a successful Hollywood film producer.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad was a National Geographic photographer so he&#8217;d go all over the world,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was fun because I got this beautiful, rooted home life in a really cool, small town but then in addition got to go all over the place and travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>While in high school at the prestigious Marin Academy in San Rafael, CA, he became interested in not only sports, but also the arts, especially painting and photography. From there he chose UC Santa Cruz as the place to pursue his artistic dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell in love with the campus as soon as I got there and then the people,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The community spoke to my Northern California roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Brian was fortunate enough to study painting with renowned artist&#160;<strong>Eduardo Carrillo*</strong>, who was a beloved art professor at&#160;UCSC&#160;for over 25 years. &#8220;He was an amazing artist and person, and my friend,&#8221; said Brian. &#8220;I also regarded him as my mentor but I, very sadly, lost him half way through.&#8221; Carrillo, who was struggling with cancer, died in 1997, two years before Brian graduated.</p>
<p>After Carrillo&#8217;s death, Brian knew that he had to push himself and to try to find his own voice, and himself. He found other, very inspiring, art professors, including&#160;<strong>Professor Elizabeth Stephens</strong>, now Chair of the&#160;UCSC&#160;Art Department, who encouraged him to be &#8220;wildly creative&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;During my senior year, my friends and I got really weird and started a horrible movement that no one ever picked up on called &#8216;Spacio&#160;Temperal&#160;Appliance Displacement&#8217;,&#8221; he laughs. &#8220;We&#8217;d drive in and drop a refrigerator in the middle of campus. One time we spent a weekend burying a dryer near the Theater Arts Department. We got in big trouble when a walking tour of the department went by and thought it was a permanent exhibit! That&#8217;s when we thought that this project&#160;wasn&#8217;t such a great idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>For his senior thesis Brian and a fellow student collaborator snagged two full-sized bath tubs, positioned them near the library, filled them with water, stripped down to their undies, and then sat in the tubs for a half hour, shivering the entire time. &#8220;We got into some really neat, mind-bending stuff,&#8221; he says fondly, remembering his time as an experimental performance artist. &#8220;I loved doing it. I loved everything I learned at&#160;UCSC.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it came time to choose a career, he knew that he wanted to do something that involved collaborating and creating. A friend of his who was making a documentary persuaded him to be the producer on the film and from there Brian was hooked. He took the plunge and moved to Los Angeles, hoping to get into the film business, and landed at one of the world&#8217;s top talent agencies, Creative Artists Agency (CAA), where he worked his way up through the ranks and learned everything he could about producing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I eventually became an agent which was an incredible education,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I got to work with some really fantastic people and I credit them for giving me a solid base training that has enabled me to do what I do now.&#8221;</p>
<p>After nine years at&#160;CAA, he was ready to launch into the world of producing and founded his own production company,&#160;Automatik, which has already made over 60 films. In the meantime, he also has started a management company called Grandview that represents writers, directors, and actors.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge amount of synergy between them,&#8221; says Brian about the two companies. &#8220;But none of our managers at Grandview produce &#8211; they strictly represent and manage people.&#8221; As of 2016, Brian brought in&#160;<em>La La Land</em>&#160;producer&#160;<strong>Fred Berger</strong>&#160;as his partner and they are continuing to make&#160;Automatik&#160;a Hollywood success story.</p>
<p>Although he&#8217;s produced many noteworthy horror movies, including the huge box office hit&#160;<em>Paranormal Activity</em>,&#160;as well as&#160;<em>Insidious</em>&#160;(starring Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson),&#160;<em>Take Shelter</em>&#160;(starring Michael Shannon and Jessica&#160;Chastain), and&#160;<em>Sinister</em>&#160;(starring Ethan Hawke), Brian enjoys all kinds of film genres.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the collaboration and that every day there&#8217;s a new challenge,&#8221; he says, &#8220;because every day you&#8217;re in an insane time frame, bringing a group of talented people together, and a group of talented artists together&#8230;and sometimes that all jives together really well. And other times it&#8217;s very challenging to make it all work. I&#8217;m so fortunate that I get to be a part of that magic, the magic of filmmaking, and letting filmmakers know that they&#8217;re in a safe space to go and make really cool art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another recent success was the world premiere of his latest film&#160;<em>I Think We&#8217;re Alone Now</em>&#160;which was screened at the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival last January. It stars Peter&#160;Dinklage&#160;and Elle Fanning and won the Sundance Festival&#8217;s&#160;U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Excellence in Filmmaking.&#160;</p>
<p>Brian advises art and film students to not be afraid to just make things. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a lot of incredible short films and I think the best thing you can do as a filmmaker is to shoot and then throw it away until you get what you want. The good news about technology today is that there&#8217;s no reason that you can&#8217;t rent a camera and throw some really great lenses on it, and go make something with your friends over a weekend and it can look professional. Keep doing that until you&#8217;re finally happy with the result, then let that piece be your calling card.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great example of that method was when he worked with a young, new writer/director named&#160;<strong>Jeff Nichols</strong>&#160;who, fresh out of art school, worked tirelessly to scrape together $250,000 in order to shoot his first film&#160;<em>Shotgun Stories</em>.&#160;The success of the film enabled Nichols to go on to write and direct such notable films as&#160;<em>Take Shelter</em>,&#160;<em>Mud</em>,&#160;<em>Midnight Special</em>&#160;and, most recently, the Academy Award- nominated film&#160;<em>Loving</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brian&#8217;s success is an incredible inspiration to our students; his passion for creativity, his commitment to diversity (something we discussed at length when I had the pleasure of meeting Brian in his offices at&#160;Automatik&#160;last year),&#8221; says the Arts Division&#8217;s Dean Susan&#160;Solt. &#8220;His successes as a business-minded producer are such a wonderful testament to what is truly special about the Arts at UC Santa Cruz, and the very specific and unique experience our students have.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Brian&#160;isn&#8217;t the only successful filmmaker in his family. His wife,&#160;<strong>Shana&#160;Feste</strong>,&#160;is a writer and director whose films include&#160;<em>The Greatest</em>&#160;(starring Pierce&#160;Brosnan, Susan&#160;Sarandon, Carey Mulligan and Michael Shannon),&#160;<em>Country Strong</em>&#160;(starring&#160;Gwyneth&#160;Paltrow&#160;and produced by Toby Maguire), and&#160;<em>Endless Love</em>&#160;(starring&#160;Joely&#160;Richardson and Gabriella Wilde).</p>
<p>He feels very lucky that he and Shana were able to work on a film together entitled&#160;<em>Boundaries</em>, starring Vera&#160;Farmiga&#160;and Christopher Plummer, which is due to be released soon. The film, inspired by&#160;Feste&#8217;s father, revolves around a single mother who, along with her teenage son, must drive her estranged, pot-smoking father across country after he gets kicked out of a nursing home. Unexpected adventures ensue when the father makes some extra stops along the way, including one to his daughter&#8217;s deadbeat ex-husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;People always warn against working with your spouse, but for us it was a super pleasure,&#8221; he says. His wife wrote and directed the film, and Brian produced. &#8220;She was a blast to make that movie with!&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian&#8217;s family continues to grow and, along with their four-year-old and two-year-old boys, they recently welcomed a baby girl to the fold. &#8220;When I&#8217;m not working, I try to hang out as much as possible with my family,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My kids are so inspiring to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of UC Santa Cruz, Brian still has warmhearted memories. &#8220;I love UC Santa Cruz and I&#8217;m really proud to be a banana slug! What I love the most about&#160;UCSC&#160;is that people work collaboratively. That kind of collaboration has continued to define how I work, and it&#8217;s very special&#8230;.I have a lot of gratitude for that.&#8221;</p>
