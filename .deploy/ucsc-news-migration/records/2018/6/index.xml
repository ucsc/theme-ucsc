<p>Partch, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, is a leading researcher in the field of chronobiology, studying the molecular mechanisms of the biological clock that drives the daily rhythms of life. J&#252;rgen Aschoff, one of the founders of the field, made fundamental observations about how animals respond to light that became known as Aschoff's Rule. In 1991, one of the scientists Aschoff mentored, Till Roenneberg, took from Aschoff's lab the battered old wooden ruler he had used to trace patterns in behavioral data, mounted it on a bronze plaque, and began the tradition of giving Aschoff's Ruler to a top scientist in the field.</p>
<p>Each recipient of Aschoff's Ruler chooses the next year's recipient, according to a set of guidelines. "There's no organization or committee involved. It's an honor that comes from a fellow scientist, which makes it special," Partch said.</p>
<p>Biological clocks are ancient mechanisms, operating in organisms from algae to humans. A longstanding question about how the timing of the circadian clock is regulated in humans and other mammals has just been resolved by a recent study involving Partch's lab at UC Santa Cruz. In collaboration with researchers at the University of Michigan and other institutions, Partch investigated a key process that determines the timing of the clock. In a paper <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/05/15/1721076115">published May 21 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, the researchers identified the enzyme that carries out a critical step in this process.</p>
<p>The new findings help explain why a certain genetic variant in a gene called PERIOD causes people to be so-called "morning larks," going to bed early and waking up early (often before 4 a.m.) every day. The variant, which changes a single amino acid in the PERIOD protein, speeds up the clock so that, instead of being on a roughly 24-hour cycle, morning larks have an internal clock with a 21-hour cycle.</p>
<p>"We've identified a critical step that depends on this one amino acid," Partch said. "Now that we've identified the enzyme that regulates this process, we could potentially develop drugs to control circadian timing and the onset of sleep, helping people adjust to jet lag or shift work."</p>
<p>Partch's lab developed an assay using a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that allows them to probe the molecular interactions of the clock proteins with an unprecedented level of resolution. Coauthor Sabrina Hunt, a graduate student working with Partch, performed the crucial NMR spectroscopy experiments.</p>
<p>"It's an interesting case where understanding the effects on human behavior led us to the biochemistry of the clock," Partch said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bd66c5a3807270175cb4ed6b783c98e9"><name>environmental-sciences</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz offers new major in environmental sciences</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has approved a new interdisciplinary major in environmental sciences leading to a B.S. degree.</summary><keywords>Patrick Chuang, Raphael Kudela</keywords><start-date>1528120800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz offers new major in environmental sciences</display-name><path>/2018/06/environmental-sciences</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/environmental-sciences</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1527891018064</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528126826438</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/uc-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/uc-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>uc-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>uc-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14462</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has approved a new major in environmental sciences leading to a B.S. degree. An interdepartmental program with an emphasis on the physical sciences, the new major will teach students how to apply fundamental concepts of chemistry, physics, and mathematics to environmental problems in areas such as climate, pollution, and water resources.</p>
<p>Jointly run by the Departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences and Ocean Sciences, the <a href="https://esci.ucsc.edu/">environmental sciences major</a> will begin enrolling students in fall 2018. Patrick Chuang, professor of earth and planetary sciences, and Raphael Kudela, professor of ocean sciences, led the development of the new program.</p>
<p>"The quantitative approach and focus on physical sciences distinguish this major from related programs," Chuang said. "I've seen many students struggling to find the right major for them, and I saw the need for a program rooted in the physical sciences that applies those tools to environmental issues."</p>
<p>The primary areas of study within the new environmental sciences major include climate and climate change; global cycles of water, carbon, mercury, and other elements ("biogeochemical cycles"); water resources and water quality; oceans (physical, chemical, and biological oceanography); and atmospheric science (meteorology, air quality, and atmospheric chemistry).</p>
<p>The new program is complementary to the environmental studies major, based in the Social Sciences Division, which emphasizes social, political, and economic aspects of environmental issues, as well as ecology, conservation biology, and sustainability.</p>
<p>The core faculty of the environmental sciences major are primarily from the Departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences and Ocean Sciences. Faculty from other departments, such as Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, may also be involved. In addition to new courses created for the environmental sciences curriculum, the Ocean Sciences Department, which has not previously offered an undergraduate degree, is revamping several courses to support the new major.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to see this new degree move forward," Kudela said. "We expect the program to evolve and to be shaped by the students and their interests."</p>
<p>Graduates of the program will be prepared for a variety of careers in areas such as environmental consulting, industry compliance, and government agencies, as well as for graduate or professional school in a wide range of fields.</p>
<p>"Our survey of potential employers indicated a real need for people with a solid grounding in the quantitative sciences that they can bring to bear on environmental issues," Chuang said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://esci.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Environmental Sciences Major</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be425dda807270175cb4ed6be95099e3"><name>phone-outage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus phone service restored</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is currently experience an outage in its campus phone service. </summary><start-date>1527836400000</start-date><display-name>Service outage</display-name><path>/2018/06/phone-outage</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/phone-outage</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1527905409452</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1527912942560</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><strong>Telephone service at UC Santa Cruz has been restored as of about 9 p.m. Friday, June 1.&#160;</strong></p>

The internationally recognized science writing program has previously led to a graduate certificate. The switch from certificate to master's degree does not involve any changes to the curriculum and was approved by UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>
<p>"The review committees unanimously recognized that the program is deeply rigorous and the preparation and training are substantive enough to warrant a master's degree," said program director Erika Check Hayden. "This decision is a testament to the work that [previous directors] John Wilkes and Rob Irion have done in building this program, and a lot of credit also goes to the instructors, students, and alumni whose work has earned our international reputation as a leading science journalism program."</p>
<p>Although the lack of a master's degree hasn't limited the careers of the program's previous graduates, Hayden said the question always comes up in conversations with prospective students.</p>
<p>"In journalism, the type of degree you have doesn't matter much. But there are lots of different kinds of careers in science communication now, and for some of those a master's degree might be helpful," she said. "This change will boost our ability to recruit top candidates."</p>
<p>Widely regarded as one of the best science writing programs in the world, the UCSC Science Communication Program focuses on practical training through rigorous coursework and diverse internships. It is the only graduate science writing program in the United States that requires a degree in science and experience in research. Graduates of the one-year program work as writers and editors at the nation's top newspapers, science magazines, online and broadcast news services, research agencies, universities, and medical centers.</p>
<p>Hayden also thanked the Physical and Biological Sciences Dean's Office, and in particular assistant dean Carrie Haber, for helping to shepherd the program's proposal to convert to a master's degree through the approval process at the campus level and at the UC Office of the President, and for the division's support of this unique program.</p>
<p>"What makes the program special is the way we combine real-world experience and classroom learning to prepare students for lifelong careers," Hayden said. "I am thrilled with the students we're seeing these days, especially the diversity of applicants we're getting and the variety of career paths we see our alumni engage in. The master's degree will help continue and accelerate this positive trend."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d110a607807270175cb4ed6b4f4aa04a"><name>caafd</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Chancellor’s awards recognize achievement in diversity, inclusion</title><summary>Underscoring the commitment by UC Santa Cruz to promote diversity, inclusion, and excellence, Chancellor George Blumenthal recognized the people and programs making contributions to these goals through their work. </summary><start-date>1528182000000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor’s Achievement Awards for Diversity</display-name><path>/2018/06/caafd</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/caafd</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1528220918168</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528260679332</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/chancellor-group-diversity-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/chancellor-group-diversity-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chancellor-group-diversity-500px.jpg</name><display-name>chancellor-group-diversity-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>352219</file-size><width>600</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt>Diversity award recipients</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/diversity-awards-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/diversity-awards-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>diversity-awards-80px.jpg</name><display-name>diversity-awards-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>18108</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Principles of Community banners</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>From left: Katherine M&#7929;-Duy&#234;n L&#234;, vice president of diversity and inclusion for Student Union Assembly;&#160;Juan Manuel Ruiz Cortes, master&#8217;s graduate student in philosophy;&#160;Pablo G.

<p>The 2018 Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Awards for Diversity were presented May 29 during a reception at the Hay Barn. Before presenting the awards, Blumenthal noted that promoting understanding, taking the time to create a community that values differences, and recognizing the unique contributions of all people enriches UC Santa Cruz and its community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are stronger when all members of our community feel respected, feel empowered, and feel valued,&#8221; Blumenthal said. &#8220;That is why building community is so important. It is not simply diversity for diversity&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

The fictional Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lore will never send you a letter of acceptance. But perhaps if you&#8217;re lucky, you will grow up and attend a school as magical as UC Santa Cruz, which offers a class on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Renee Fox, an assistant professor of literature, and co-director of the Dickens Project at UC Santa Cruz, was not quite sure what to expect when she offered the class for the first time this winter. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the course, officially known as LIT 80Y: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was such a rousing success that Fox now plans to bring it back in the near future. In fact, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was one of the most popular Humanities offerings of 2018, with nearly 400 students enrolling. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The class had been in the works for a while. &#8220;Whenever I&#8217;ve just taught one of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> books, I&#8217;ve desperately wanted to have time to teach more of them, so I finally suggested that I teach a class devoted to the whole series,&#8221; said Fox, who specializes in Victorian literature. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox, after all, is a committed &#8220;Potterhead.&#8221; Like other fans of J.K. Rowling&#8217;s series, she&#8217;s visited the Pottermore website to take its personality quiz to be &#8220;sorted&#8221; into a Hogwarts house, one of the schools&#8217; four dormitories: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also knows the shape of her &#8220;patronus spell&#8221;&#8212;the wizarding version of a spirit animal. &#160;More importantly, Fox has read the series many times, and has assigned </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> books in courses on gothic and monster literature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The class reading list was ambitious: students had to read all seven books, though they were allowed to see the movie version of the fifth book during midterms if they were pressed for time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each week the course covered a book in the series. Instead of inviting a simple, straightforward reading of these popular books, Fox had her students use each volume as a means to discuss literary theory. Students used complex textual analysis to examine the book in a new light. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the first book was a jumping off point for &#8220;genre studies.&#8221; Students examined the book, seeking out the traits that make the Harry Potter series fall into the realm of children&#8217;s literature. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While reading the second book, students learn about psychoanalysis and the role of developmental stages on the characters. Students even take a look at animal studies to understand the significance of a wizard&#8217;s ability to take the shape of animals in the third novel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For students like Tari Kurman (Cowell &#8216;17, neuroscience), who needed to fill the TA (textual analysis) general education requirement for graduation, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potte</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">r course was an attractive option. &#8220;My mom would read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to my brother and me before I even knew how to read,&#8217;&#8217; Kurman said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve reread the book an embarrassing amount of times.&#8221; </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s one thing to plow through these books as a fan, and another to revisit them in an academic setting, a process that helped students uncover more than they did as children reading the book for entertainment. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first assignment, students wrote about the experience of reading the books as adults. Some students wrote about how the books raise interesting questions about identity, since wizards can change their appearance or even become invisible. The poor treatment of house elves and muggle-borns in the wizarding world prompted discussions of gender, race, and class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox taught students to take a methodical, deliberate look at the novels. &#8220;When you look closely at the very first pages of each novel, you learn huge amounts about the thematic preoccupations, politics, prejudices, and questions that will unfold over the rest of the novel that follows,&#8221; Fox said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course brought some of the charming aspects of the novels to life. Like their counterparts at Hogwarts, students in the course got assigned to one of the schools&#8217; houses based on their section time and teaching assistant. Representatives from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin would tackle an interpretive question and earn points for their house. The house with the most points at the end of the quarter received extra credit in the course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox hopes students have left the course with an appreciation for how smart the books are, and how complexly they navigate questions of identity, power, race, class, and political systems. She hopes that students will have a better understanding of what literary analysis is, and how its approach to the novels would be different from the approach of an ethics or religion course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students enjoyed the course, which many said met their high expectations. For Thais Hogart (Rachel Carson &#8216;18, literature), the course was a highlight of the year. Hogart&#8217;s father used to give her a hard time for rereading the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> books so often, because he thought the books were for children. This course validated Hogart: if there is enough substance in the novels for a whole college course, it&#8217;s worth the many reads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I appreciated this course,&#8221; says Hogart. &#8220;I enjoyed being able to have intellectual conversations about books I&#8217;ve loved my whole life.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d124c253807270175cb4ed6b4ea40cd9"><name>alumni-profile-hinton-henry</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Commencement stories: Henry Hinton</title><summary>Henry Hinton, graduating with a bioengineering degree from the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, will be attending Harvard University for his electrical engineering Ph.D. in the fall.</summary><start-date>1528272000000</start-date><display-name> Commencement stories: Henry Hinton</display-name><path>/2018/06/alumni-profile-hinton-henry</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/alumni-profile-hinton-henry</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1528222237242</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528310229367</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/henryhinton1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/henryhinton1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>henryhinton1.jpg</name><display-name>henryhinton1.jpg</display-name><file-size>194185</file-size><width>400</width><height>481</height></image><image-alt>Henry Hinton, Merrill '18.</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Merrill ’18, bioengineering

<p>The <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/c/meet-the-women-of-influence-class-for2018-l-z/4890/sherry-hashimoto-main.html">publication selected Sherry Hashimoto Main</a> to be among its 100 influential women, a list that was drawn from nearly 300 nominations. This is the 10th year the publication has created this ranking.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has a rich history of influential women&#8212;from Angela Davis on the faculty to alumna Katherine Sullivan,&#8221; Main said. &#8220;To be able to benefit from their efforts and have a part in the conversations that are driving the future of Silicon Valley and beyond is a true privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to her leadership at UC Santa Cruz, Main is currently serving as staff adviser to the University of California Board of Regents, where she represents more than 140,000 non-academic employee staff at the UC&#8217;s 10 campuses, five medical centers and hospitals, and three national laboratories. Her work on the UC Board of Regents includes advocacy efforts in support of career development, childcare and dependent care, and employee wellness.</p>
<p>Main is an advocate for women and girls, serving as a board member for both Women for Girls and The CLUB Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Women in nonprofits, startups, manufacturing, aviation, legal, and finance are represented in this year&#8217;s ranking. All of the women have made an impact at work and in their communities.</p>

His appointment this year to UCSC's Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health recognizes Zachos's important contributions in this area and provides support for his research and related activities.</p>
<p>Zachos said he plans to use the funds from the endowed chair to support ongoing investigations of a period of rapid global warming around 56 million years ago called the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Previous research led by Zachos showed that a massive release of greenhouse gases, possibly triggered by volcanism, caused average global temperatures to increase by at least 5 degrees Celsius during the PETM, which lasted about 150,000 years. He and other researchers subsequently showed that carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are occurring at a rate ten times faster than carbon emissions during the PETM.</p>
<p>"For over two decades we've been working on this case study of extreme global warming," he said. "One of the things we're focusing on now is to understand how precipitation patterns changed globally and regionally, such as along the mid-Atlantic margin, from Virginia to New York."</p>
<p>By studying sediment cores from the seafloor along the Atlantic coast, Zachos and his collaborators have found evidence of increased erosion and sediment transport into the coastal ocean during the PETM warming event. They also see evidence of coastal acidification and malformation of calcifying plankton (calcium carbonate shells are harder to build as the ocean becomes more acidic due to absorbed carbon dioxide).</p>
<p>"We're trying to quantify the changes in coastal salinity and nutrients, because increased runoff delivers more nutrients to the coast, which can drive algal blooms and eutrophication," Zachos said. "We also want to see if the effects of ocean acidification are amplified in coastal settings. The same concerns exist for coastal California because of potential changes in climate and the dynamics of coastal upwelling."</p>
<p>With the funding from the endowed chair, Zachos will be working with Earth system and climate modelers to compare his observational data with the output of state-of-the-art global climate models. "This funding will allow us to pursue several new ideas," he said.</p>
<p>The Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health was established in 1998 and is intended for an outstanding scholar with research interests in the area of ocean health. Zachos's five-year appointment to the chair includes funding to support teaching, research, outreach, and graduate fellowships. He is the fifth faculty member to hold the chair, succeeding Raphael Kudela, professor of ocean sciences.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d66ad8e4807270175cb4ed6b0e5b4fbc"><name>haney-summit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>  Global experts attend academic summit on solitary confinement</title><summary>Forty-five of the world's experts on the psychological and physical effects of solitary confinement gathered in Santa Cruz recently for a two-day academic summit.</summary><keywords>prison, incarceration, solitary, confinement, haney, psychology, health, medical, mental, psychology</keywords><start-date>1528268400000</start-date><display-name>Haney-Summit</display-name><path>/2018/06/haney-summit</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/haney-summit</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1528310715565</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528324996958</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/haney_craig-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/haney_craig-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haney_craig-400.jpg</name><display-name>haney_craig-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>67052</file-size><width>400</width><height>268</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Craig Haney</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/haney-eastern-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/haney-eastern-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>haney-eastern-80.jpg</name><display-name>haney-eastern-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7413</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of interior of Eastern State Museum</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>"Social contact is a fundamental human need," says Distinguished Professor of Psychology Craig Haney, who organized a recent academic summit on solitary confinement.

<p>The gathering sought to develop consensus among scientific experts, human rights leaders, legal academics, and correctional officials, said Distinguished Professor of Psychology Craig Haney, who co-chaired and co-sponsored the meeting.</p>
<p>"It was a remarkable two days," said Haney. "The synergy of having so many international experts together in the same place, many of whom were meeting each other for the first time, was extraordinary. There were lively discussions all day, every day. People were still talking after dinner on Friday night. Long after the conference had formally ended, the conversations kept going."</p>
<p>The goal of the summit was to develop a set of principles governing the use of solitary confinement based on the latest scientific knowledge about its harmful effects, said Haney, a leading expert on the adverse psychological effects of solitary confinement. The critique to date has largely focused on psychological suffering, but a growing body of scientific evidence is documenting the harmful physical effects of isolation, social exclusion, and loneliness, he said.</p>
<p>"The effects are parallel, but in some ways even more surprising," explained Haney. "Being isolated tends to make people feel depressed, which isn't terribly shocking. But being lonely or socially excluded also places people at significantly greater risk of becoming physically ill and of dying at a younger age. It's less intuitive, but it parallels the psychologically adverse effects."</p>
<p><strong>New research</strong></p>
<p>A surge of research in neuroscience, genetics, and other fields has documented the broad impact of loneliness and social exclusion on things like immune-system function, stress reactions, and other biological processes, said Haney. "In some ways, studies done with the general population are easier to do than in prisons, which are often off-limits to researchers," he said. "But in the world outside prison, there have now been scores of studies published documenting the harmful psychological <em>and</em> physical effects of isolation."</p>
<p>"Social contact is a fundamental human need," said Haney. "When people are deprived of the opportunity to have it, bad things happen. Some of the bad things are painful, and feel traumatic. But other effects are more subtle. Over the long run, they can do as much or more damage as the immediate trauma."</p>
<p>These broader findings "put the solitary confinement literature in an established scientific context," said Haney. "Nowhere is social isolation more dehumanizing and conditions more depriving than prison."</p>
<p>Thus, summit attendees agreed the data regarding the psychological and physical consequences of solitary confinement need to be translated into standards and rules limiting its use inside prisons.</p>
<p>Haney cosponsored the May 23-25 gathering, "The Santa Cruz Academic Summit on Solitary Confinement &amp; Health: Next Steps in Reducing the Use and Misuse of Solitary Confinement," with Brie Williams, a professor of medicine in the Division of Geriatrics at UC San Francisco and the director of the Criminal Justice &amp; Health Program at UCSF.</p>
<p>Participants from Europe and across the United States included Rick Raemisch, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, who has implemented widespread prison reforms during his tenure; Judith Resnick, the Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, whose work has educated scholars, policy makers, and the public about the scope and conditions of solitary confinement; Donald Specter, executive director of the Prison Law Office, which litigates on behalf of the constitutional rights of prisoners; Kevin Kempf, executive director of the Association of State Correctional Administrators, which represents 400,000 professionals who oversee 8 million inmates, probationers, and parolees across the United States; Marianne Vollan, who oversees the entire Norwegian prison system, widely regarded as the most innovative and humane in the world; and David Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, which challenges the conditions of confinement in U.S. prisons and jails.</p>
<p>Summit attendees generally expressed strong support for the United Nations' so-called "<a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/GA-RESOLUTION/E_ebook.pdf">Mandela Rules</a>," which have received widespread international approval yet have not been uniformly endorsed in the United States. Among the provisions, the rules state that solitary confinement should only be used as an absolute last resort and for the shortest possible time&#8212;never for more than 15 continuous days&#8212;and that certain vulnerable populations should be excluded, including juveniles, the mentally ill, pregnant women, and the aged and physically infirm.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>Following the summit, Haney and Williams will draft and circulate a set of principles that build on the Mandela Rules, incorporate new research findings, and seek to address challenging issues, such as the role of mental health and medical professionals in the implementation of solitary confinement.</p>
<p>"There are questions about whether they should participate at all, and if so, in exactly what capacity," explained Haney. "Does participating at any level make them complicit? If mental health and medical professionals provide screening, monitoring, and care for prisoners in solitary confinement, does that indirectly legitimize the practice? Who else could provide necessary services?"</p>
<p>For Haney, who has studied solitary confinement for more than 40 years, the summit represented another hopeful moment. In January, Canada's Supreme Court issued a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/haney-canada.html">national ban</a> on the use of solitary confinement, a decision influenced heavily by Haney's testimony. Although that decision is under appeal, Haney is optimistic. "I think ultimately we will prevail," he said. "I think Canada is ready."</p>
<p>Haney has seen progress in the United States, as well. In addition to Colorado, Idaho, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio, Washington, and even California have made significant changes to their correctional policies regarding solitary confinement. "Colorado is the national leader in solitary confinement reform, having adopted the Mandela-inspired 15-day limit, but a number of states are moving in that direction," said Haney.</p>
<p>"Ten years ago, nobody would have thought what Colorado has done was possible," said Haney. "But now we have the director of corrections in Colorado saying, 'Yes, it is, because <em>we</em> did it.' "</p>
<p>Haney is immersed in the subject of solitary confinement: The summit followed a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/haney-davis.html">public campus event</a> about the future of <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/haney-incarceration.html">criminal justice reform</a> with Professor Emerita Angela Davis, as well as two survivors of the notorious Angola Prison in Louisiana who spent a combined 72 years in solitary confinement. Immediately after the summit, Haney flew to Philadelphia to participate as a member of the <a href="https://www.vera.org/">Vera Institute of Justice</a><span>&#8217;s advisory board on a nationwide project</span> that seeks to reduce the use of solitary confinement in local jails and state prisons around the country.</p>
<p>In addition to Haney's UC Presidential Chair, additional support for the summit was provided by the Jacob and Valeria Langeloth Foundation and the University of Pittsburg School of Law and the UC Criminal Justice &amp; Health Program at UCSF.</p>

<p>Staff members play a central role in the mission of UC Santa Cruz, and it is vital that they feel valued and engaged. This is important for staff retention, as well as for the success of our campus and the fundamental health of our community. It was, in fact, the importance of staff that inspired the reinstitution of the Campus Welfare Committee (CWC) last year and the charge that instructed this group to focus on ways to improve staff engagement.</p>
<h2>The work of the CWC</h2>
<p>CWC began by looking at the research on employee engagement to better understand what impacts it. The committee also reviewed the results of the last three UC employee engagement surveys. Compared to other campuses in the system, UC Santa Cruz has performed at or near the bottom on the level of engagement.</p>
<p>Four areas where UC Santa Cruz had statistically significant lower levels of performance were in the areas of engagement, career development, organizational change, and image/brand. In addition to reviewing the engagement survey findings, the committee invited <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/human-resources/coro/2017_forms/2016-CORO-Projects-Northern-California-Final-Report.pdf">members from the 2016&#8211;17 CORO cohort</a>, which is a UC-wide leadership development program, to present the findings of their year-long study on diversity and inclusion across employees at UC. The committee felt the CORO findings would help provide additional context on the engagement of employees.</p>
<p>From this work, the CWC identified six categories to frame their exploration on engagement and the development of recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>community building</li>
<li>communication</li>
<li>workload</li>
<li>professional advancement</li>
<li>change management</li>
<li>training and mentorship</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to generate feedback to form recommendations in each of the six categories, the CWC conducted focus groups and sent out a campus survey. The CWC also sought feedback on activities already underway across the campus in the six categories.</p>
<p>As a result of this work the CWC identified a set of recommendations in the six categories of engagement. These recommendations consist of a mix of current best practices, enhanced communication about existing programs, and potential new initiatives and programs.</p>
<h2>Ways to learn more and provide feedback</h2>
<p>In order to share the recommendations, discuss actions underway and get feedback on the priorities for investment, we are hosting three staff listening sessions. They will take place at:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 a.m., May 4 in the Auditorium at the UC Santa Cruz Scotts Valley Center.</li>
<li>2 p.m., June 6 at the Stevenson Event Center at the UC Santa Cruz main campus.</li>
<li>3 p.m on June 26 in Room 2110 at the Silicon Valley Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each session will last one hour and is open to all staff. Members of the CWC and Staff Human Resources will be on hand to help facilitate the discussion and feedback.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Through 2018, the committee will continue its work into the next phase of activity, consisting of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitoring implementation of actions already underway,</li>
<li>Engaging with the campus community as to other recommendations that would require new programs, initiatives, or resources, and</li>
<li>Overseeing a task force charged with focusing on the development of a compensation philosophy. The lack of a locally articulated compensation philosophy can lead to confusion and negatively impact employee engagement and satisfaction. This task force will work to develop a campus compensation philosophy. During our listening sessions, we will review the charge of the compensation philosophy task force.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensuring we can enhance our employee engagement is a priority for the campus leadership team. Our employees and their contributions are valuable to our community. We hope that staff will join us for our listening sessions to discuss this very important aspect of our campus community.</p>

Yet, school children who are learning English are segregated and stigmatized in ways that have negative impacts that persist for years, according to educational researchers who say it's time to cast aside the "deficit model" of non-native English speakers.</p>
<p>Peggy Estrada, an associate research scientist in Latin American and Latino Studies, presented her team's latest research results during an informal workshop that focused on the educational needs and experiences of Latino and immigrant youth. The interdisciplinary workshop took place May 30 under the auspices of a <a href="https://clrc.ucsc.edu/research-clusters/past-and-present-research-clusters.html">research cluster</a> created by Economics Professor Rob Fairlie with support from the Chicano Latino Research Center.</p>
<p>"For four years, the research cluster has fostered discussion about academic outcomes among Latino, immigrant, and disadvantaged students," said Fairlie. "The goal was to bring together faculty from different departments to discuss issues around this important topic."</p>
<p>Over the years, workshops have attracted faculty, researchers, and graduate students from departments across the Social Sciences Division, including Economics, Latin American and Latino Studies, Education, Sociology, Psychology, and Environmental Studies.</p>
<p><strong>English learners</strong></p>
<p>Forty-three percent of K-12 school children in California speak a primary language other than English in the home, according to Estrada, whose talk was titled <em>"Conceptions of Secondary English Learners: 'They call them lifers.' "</em> Children who don't pass an English proficiency test when they enroll in school are classified as "English learners," or EL's, a label that carries a "deficit" connotation because it is based on failing to meet a performance threshold, she said. She noted that while these students come from varied backgrounds, the vast majority are U.S.-born, Latino, and poor.</p>
<p>In research based on interviews and surveys of teachers and school staff in two districts across the state, Estrada and her team uncovered widespread stigmatization of secondary English learners labeled long-term ELs&#8212;due to not reclassifying as fluent English proficient within an assumed normative period. The host of "unintended negative consequences" on students include curricular placement that isolates them academically, linguistically, and socially. These conditions are related to diminished student academic self-efficacy and teacher instructional self-efficacy. Estrada called on educators to build on the competencies and potential of English learners and to support the English language development of all students.</p>
<p>Also presenting during the workshop were Veronica Terriquez, associate professor of sociology, and Laura Giuliano, who will join the Economics Department in July as a professor of economics.</p>
<p><strong>Youth engagement</strong></p>
<p>Terriquez, whose talk was titled <em>"Critical Civics Education and Action among the Children of Immigrants," </em>invited feedback on a new theoretical framework she is developing to shed light on how young people, especially immigrants, learn to become civically engaged and politically active.</p>
<p>Terriquez is exploring how to measure the impact of potential pathways to engagement that include parental engagement, involvement with civic associations, high school classes, and media&#8212;particularly social media. Immigrant youth tend to be less engaged than their native-born counterparts, she said, adding that her own survey research indicates that parental engagement appears to be a strong predictor of youth engagement for most youth, regardless of immigrant background. However, she has also found that the small proportion of young people who become involved in grassroots youth organizing or other social change associations during adolescence tend to exhibit particularly high levels of civic and political participation in early adulthood.</p>
<p>Terriquez fielded questions and input from several workshop attendees, including Psychology Professor Barbara Rogoff, Economics Professor Lori Kletzer, and Education and Philosophy Professor Ron Glass.</p>
<p><strong>Math acceleration</strong></p>
<p>In her talk, <em>"Heterogeneous Effects of Middle School Math Tracking," </em>Giuliano discussed the effects of mathematics acceleration beginning in the sixth grade, looking at impacts on girls, students from low-income families, and students from groups that are underrepresented in so-called STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Giuliano's research, based on data from a large, urban school district, will follow the educational outcomes through college of students who were subjected to test-based tracking.</p>
<p>Students in the United States do poorly in math and science compared to their counterparts in much of the world, noted Giuliano. Accelerated math pathways, including "Algebra for All" programs, are intended to improve overall student performance in STEM fields and encourage more girls and underrepresented minorities to pursue math and science&#8212;which underscores the importance of evaluating the success of such programs, as well as alternative methods of determining which students are accelerated, she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ef90f839807270175cb4ed6b63d76049"><name>coral-reefs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Without coral reefs, annual flood damages from storms could double globally</title><summary>New study shows annual costs soaring to $272 billion, sending a powerful signal about reefs and their importance during the International Year of the Reef.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck</keywords><start-date>1528815600000</start-date><display-name>Without coral reefs, annual flood damages from storms could double globally</display-name><path>/2018/06/coral-reefs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/coral-reefs</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1528732644318</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528816484134</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Rachel Winters, TNC</name><title></title><phone/><email>rwinters@tnc.org</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/aerial-view-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/aerial-view-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aerial-view-410.jpg</name><display-name>aerial-view-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>78815</file-size><width>410</width><height>302</height></image><image-alt>aerial view of coral reefs</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/aerial-view-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/aerial-view-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aerial-view-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>aerial-view-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29531</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>aerial view of coral reefs</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Coral reefs serve as natural, submerged breakwaters that reduce flooding by breaking waves and reducing wave energy.

Coral reefs, which provide a first line of defense against coastal flooding in countries around the world, are being lost rapidly. A new study investigating how much people and property are protected by coral reefs, and what is at stake if our reefs are lost, shows that coral reefs cut the cost of all flood-related damages around the world in half.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04568-z">Published June 12 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, the study (&#8220;The global flood protection savings provided by coral reefs&#8221;) uses models commonly applied in the engineering and insurance sectors to quantify and value the flood reduction benefits provided by coral reefs worldwide. Coral reefs serve as natural, submerged breakwaters that reduce flooding by breaking waves and reducing wave energy. The study compares the flooding that occurs now with the flooding that would occur on coastlines with coral reefs if just the topmost 1 meter of living coral reef were lost.</p>
<p>Significant losses of coral reefs are already happening, according to first author Michael Beck, research professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz and lead marine scientist at the Nature Conservancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we are already losing the height and complexity of shallow reefs around the world, so we are likely already seeing increases in flood damages along many tropical coastlines,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our national economies are normally only valued by how much we take from nature. For the first time, we can now value what every national economy gains in flood savings by conserving its coral reefs every year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without living coral reefs, the annual expected damages from flooding would double, increasing by $4 billion. The costs from frequent storms would triple. If coupled with sea level rise, flooding could quadruple. For the big 100-year storms, flood damages could increase by 91 percent to $272 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We built the best global coastal flooding model, and then we added reefs to estimate flood risk overall and the benefits provided by these habitats,&#8221; said coauthor &#205;&#241;igo Losada at the Environmental Hydraulics Institute of the University of Cantabria, Spain. &#8220;This represents the first global application of a coastal protection model that probabilistically estimates risk and the benefits of coastal ecosystems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The countries with the most to gain from reef conservation and restoration are Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Mexico, and Cuba; annual expected flood savings exceed $400 million for each of these nations. The United States also receives many benefits from coral reefs (ranking 8th globally), with almost $100 million annually in direct flood reduction benefits. In addition to helping alleviate costs related to flooding, coral reefs also offer other economic benefits from tourism and fisheries. Per capita, the study found that reefs provide the most benefits to small island states, including the Cayman Islands, Belize, Grenada, Cuba, Bahamas, Jamaica, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>In just the past few years, tropical storms such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria and Typhoon Haiyan have had devastating impacts, and the effects of such storms would be even worse without coral reefs. Unfortunately, reef habitats across the world have been significantly degraded and face growing threats from coastal development, sand and coral mining, destructive and excessive fishing, storms, and climate-related bleaching events.</p>
<p>&#8220;These estimates make a compelling case for present-day spending on reef management, without assuming that reefs will disappear altogether under a business-as-usual scenario, nor do they rely on just rare, large storms,&#8221; said coauthor Borja Reguero, a research scientist at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Better valuations of the benefits provided by coastal habitats like coral reefs, provided in terms familiar to decision makers, can help decision makers recognize the value and ensure the protection of these critical habitats and their services.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flood savings from coral reefs can be directly used by governments in disaster recovery planning, for example, and by businesses such as insurance. This work also provides a clear case for better reef management. The researchers have already begun working with disaster agencies and the insurance industry, including FEMA, the World Bank, Munich Re, Swiss Re, and Lloyd&#8217;s, to use these results to inform funding decisions and insurance tools that can support reef restoration for risk reduction. The results from these analyses are mappable and downloadable on the Natural Coastal Protection app at <a href="http://maps.oceanwealth.org/">maps.oceanwealth.org</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coral reefs are living ecosystems that can recover if they are well managed, and this study identifies why and where we should find the needed support for restoration and management,&#8221; said Beck. &#8220;It is our hope that this science will lead to action and greater stewardship of reefs around the world.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ef941ffe807270175cb4ed6b48503741"><name>agn-dust-clouds</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dust clouds can explain puzzling features of active galactic nuclei</title><summary>Mysterious features seen in light emitted from active galactic nuclei may be due to partial obscuration by dust clouds, according to new study.</summary><keywords>Martin Gaskell</keywords><start-date>1528981200000</start-date><display-name>Dust clouds can explain puzzling features of active galactic nuclei</display-name><path>/2018/06/agn-dust-clouds</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/agn-dust-clouds</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1528732851114</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528988899884</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/agn-outflow-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/agn-outflow-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>agn-outflow-410.jpg</name><display-name>agn-outflow-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>46718</file-size><width>410</width><height>293</height></image><image-alt>illustration of active galactic nucleus</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/agn-outflow-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/agn-outflow-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>agn-outflow-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>agn-outflow-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13066</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>illustration of active galactic nucleus</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>An artist&#8217;s impression of what an active galactic nucleus might look like close up.

Gas clouds in an area around the AGN known as the "broad-line region" emit light at characteristic wavelengths, but the complexity and variability of these emissions has been a longstanding puzzle for astrophysicists.</p>
<p>A new analysis by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/sty848">published June 14 in <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em></a>, explains these and other puzzling features of active galactic nuclei as the result of small clouds of dust that can partially obscure the innermost regions of AGNs.</p>
<p>"We've shown that a lot of mysterious properties of active galactic nuclei can be explained by these small dusty clouds causing changes in what we see," said first author Martin Gaskell, a research associate in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The findings have important implications because researchers use the optical emissions from the broad-line region to make inferences about the behavior of the gases in the inner regions around a supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>"The emission from this gas is one of the best sources of information about the mass of a black hole and how it is growing. However, the nature of this gas is poorly understood," Gaskell said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Peter Harrington, a UCSC graduate student who began work on the project as an undergraduate, explained that gas spiraling toward a galaxy's central black hole forms a flat accretion disk, and the superheated gas in the accretion disk emits intense thermal radiation. Some of that light is "reprocessed" (absorbed and re-emitted) by hydrogen and other gases swirling above and below the accretion disk in the broad-line region. Above and beyond this is a region of dust.</p>
<p>"Once the dust crosses a certain threshold it is subjected to the strong radiation from the accretion disk," said Harrington. "This radiation is so intense that it blows the dust away from the disk, resulting in a clumpy outflow of dust clouds starting at the outer edge of the broad-line region."</p>
<p>The effect of the dust clouds on the light emitted is to make the light coming from behind them look fainter and redder, just as Earth's atmosphere makes the sun look fainter and redder at sunset. In their paper, Gaskell and Harrington present several lines of observational evidence supporting the existence of such dust clouds in the inner regions of active galactic nuclei. They developed a computer code to model the effects of dust clouds on observations of the broad-line region.</p>
<p>"We've written the code so we can adjust parameters like the distribution of gas in the broad-line region, how fast it's moving, and the orientation of the system, and then we can introduce dust clouds and see how they affect the emission-line profiles," Harrington said.</p>
<p>The results show that by including dust clouds in their model, it can replicate many features of emission from the broad-line region that have long puzzled astrophysicists. Rather than the gas having a changing, asymmetrical distribution that is hard to explain, the gas is simply in a uniform, symmetric, turbulent disk around the black hole. The apparent asymmetries and changes are due to dust clouds passing in front of the broad-line region and making the regions behind them look fainter and redder.</p>
<p>"We think it is a much more natural explanation of the asymmetries and changes than other more exotic theories, such as binary black holes, that have been invoked to explain them," Gaskell said. "Our explanation lets us retain the simplicity of the standard AGN model of matter spiraling onto a single black hole."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f013da9c807270175cb4ed6ba5099f3d"><name>oakes-college-provost-search</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergraduate Education seeks part-time administrator: Oakes College Provost</title><summary>In 2018-19, the Division of Undergraduate Education is undertaking a search for a part-time faculty administrator.</summary><start-date>1528740000000</start-date><display-name>Undergraduate Education seeks part-time administrator: Oakes College Provost</display-name><path>/2018/06/oakes-college-provost-search</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/oakes-college-provost-search</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1528741223028</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528741668274</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>In 2018-19, the Division of Undergraduate Education is undertaking a search for a part-time faculty administrator:<br/><br/><a href="https://recruit.ucsc.edu/apply/JPF00553">Oakes&#160;College&#160;Provost</a><br/><br/>The initial review date is&#160;<strong>Friday, September 28</strong>.

Grateful Dead</em> is the title of a new exhibition now open to the public at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s McHenry Library.<br/><br/>This year&#8217;s annual exhibition examines how the band invented, improvised, redefined, and pioneered business practices that revealed new ways of thinking about work, about being in business, and about the relationship between creators and their communities. <br/><br/>Drawing on newly processed business records of the&#160;band from the campus&#8217;s Grateful Dead Archive, the exhibition can be found at the Brittingham Family Foundation Dead Central gallery space, located on&#160;the library&#8217;s main floor. <br/><br/>Admission is free during regular library hours.<br/><br/>Last week, the library hosted an exhibition preview and celebration to mark the 10-year anniversary of the Grateful Dead Archive at UC Santa Cruz. Band members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart officially made the announcement of the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2008/04/2142.html"><em><strong>donation of the group&#8217;s archives</strong></em></a> to UC Santa Cruz back in 2008, at a press conference hosted by the campus at San Francisco&#8217;s historic Fillmore Auditorium.<br/><br/>&#8220;Over the last 10 years, researchers, fans, and the general public have come to the UCSC Library to use the Grateful Dead Archive on a regular basis, and our yearly exhibits in particular continue to be a great draw,&#8221; said University Librarian Elizabeth Cowell, addressing the attendees in Dead Central at the preview event. <br/><br/>&#8220;I hope you enjoy the current exhibit,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a colorful and fun exhibit that wonderfully reflects the soul of the archive. Our previous exhibit, which I am hoping many of you saw as well, was entitled <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/06/library-haight-exhibit.html"><em><strong>Love on Haight: The Grateful Dead and San Francisco in 1967</strong></em></a>. We counted well over 2,000 visitors to that exhibit, and I hope we will count even more visitors this time around.&#8221;<br/><br/>Jessica Pigza, the Outreach and Exhibits Librarian for UCSC&#8217;s Special Collections and Archives, noted that the Dead Central exhibition space is a foundational part of a larger effort to make the University Library&#8217;s collections more visible and utilized by a greater number of people. She added that the library shares its collections with galleries on campus, and also loans materials to museums across the country and around the world.<br/><br/>&#8220;Putting together an exhibit like this one is so much fun because we get to share what&#8217;s in this archive, to reveal stories of how the Dead and their staff invented their own future when it came to being a band, being a business, and being a community,&#8221; said Pigza.<br/><br/>&#8220;The work of creating this exhibit was a great collaborative experience that we think worked out really well,&#8221; she added. &#8220;My co-curators were Alix Norton, an archivist who oversees the Library&#8217;s Center for Archival Research and Training, and Gabriel Mindel, who is a graduate student in the History of Consciousness program. Gabriel was a Fellow in the Center for Archival Research and Training this past year, and through his fellowship, he gained experience in archival processing, description, research, and curation.&#8221;<br/><br/>Cowell also said that she was particularly excited that the library has increasingly been able to integrate the Grateful Dead Archive into the academic work of the campus. She told the assembled guests that Melvin Backstrom was recently appointed by the Arts Division as the first Michael Bonanomi Foundation Visiting Lecturer in Popular Music. <br/><br/>&#8220;Following in the footsteps of our eth<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/mickey-hart-lieberman.html"></a>nomu<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/mickey-hart-lieberman.html"></a>sicology legend <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/mickey-hart-lieberman.html"><em><strong>Fred Lieberman</strong></em></a>, Mr. Backstrom is bringing two courses to campus during the Spring Quarter: &#8220;The Grateful Dead and the Long 1960s&#8221; and &#8220;The Collective Improvisational Practices of the Grateful Dead,&#8221; Cowell noted.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/03/management-secrets-of-the-grateful-dead/307918/</url><title>Management secrets of the Grateful Dead</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/mickey-hart-lieberman.html</url><title>Grateful Dead’s Mickey Hart pays tribute to late UCSC professor</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f0bf37b9807270175cb4ed6bf5c58495"><name>alumni-profile-rachel-doran</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Commencement stories: Rachel Doran</title><summary>Rachel Doran is a Ph.D. candidate in the graduate program in biomedical sciences and engineering, working on HIV immunogens.

To understand the changes, Professor Ari Friedlaender <a href="https://btbel.pbsci.ucsc.edu/foraging-ecology-of-humpback-whales-in-relation-to-krill-catches/">tracks their behavior</a> with satellite tags. His observations promise insights about changing ecosystems and might help develop marine protected areas to maintain critical habitat for krill predators.<br/><br/>It isn&#8217;t cheap, and just getting to the Antarctic to find the whales can be an obstacle. So it made a big difference when the international, online <a href="http://www.hogwartsrunningclub.org/">Hogwarts Running Club</a> sent Friedlaender $100,000.<br/>
<h3>The Platform 9&#190;K</h3>
The virtual running club includes 65,000 members. They connect mostly through Facebook, holding annual House Cup competitions and benefit runs several times a year. Event fees benefit causes nominated by members. The event that earned Friedlaender his funding was the 2017 Platform 9&#190;K. <br/><br/>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t do a full 10K, it&#8217;s OK it&#8217;s only 9&#190;K,&#8221; says Brian Biggs, the running club&#8217;s &#8220;Headmaster.&#8221;<br/><br/>The club favors &#8220;happy, feel-good&#8221; causes with tangible impacts, Biggs says. <br/><br/>&#8220;We like being able to tell members, &#8216;Your money went into tagging and tracking whales in order to study their migration.&#8217;&#8221; <br/><br/>The idea came from club member Ana Chang. She had visited Antarctica with National Geographic Expeditions and says she was inspired to draw the attention of the club&#8217;s membership to the continent.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the last pristine places we have,&#8221; she says. &#8220;To get that many people to be suddenly aware of a place that is so pristine and so far away&#8212;that was really special.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>&#8220;Funny proposal&#8221;</h3>
Researching organizations that support science in the Antarctic, Chang found the <a href="https://www.asoc.org/">Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition</a> or ASOC. ASOC has been advocating for conservation policy in the region for decades.<br/><br/>&#8220;I called them up and said, &#8216;I have this funny proposal,&#8217; and they went for it,&#8221; Chang says.<br/><br/>ASOC sent her a project proposal from Friedlaender, and Biggs and the club leadership approved. The run raised $130,360 for ASOC, and grew the club&#8217;s membership to include every continent.<br/><br/>In addition to the whale tracking, the funds supported research on Weddell Seals and Adelie Penguins. The 2017 Platform 9&#190;K money enabled Friedlaender to purchase satellite tags and provided for logistic support, data analysis, and manuscript writing. It also lead to a partnership with the One Ocean Expeditions tour company&#8212;helping overcome the expensive obstacle of getting to the Antarctic.<br/><br/>Friedlaender describes the running club as &#8220;one of the most passionate and energized groups of people that I ever encountered.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;They really put their money where their mouth is in terms of investing in things that are important to the people in the organization,&#8221; he says.<br/><br/>Friedlaender hopes his research will lead to effective conservation policy for the region.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2018/06/harry-potter-class</path><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2018/06/harry-potter-class</link><site>news</site><name>harry-potter-class</name><display-name>harrypotterclass</display-name><title>Harry Potter course leaves students spellbound</title><summary>Renee Fox, an assistant professor of literature at UC Santa Cruz, was not quite sure what to expect when she offered a class on Harry Potter for the first time this winter.

<p>Perched on the highest eastern slope of Nevada&#8217;s Virginia Range sits Virginia City, a town of 855 inhabitants with a history that predates the discovery of the town&#8217;s Comstock Lode of 1859. As the nation&#8217;s second largest national historic landmark, it remains historically preserved, offering an &#8220;authentic&#8221; 1860s experience that mythologizes its histories for the tourists who visit. Through the use of analogue photography, sound montages, and ethnographic text, Tailings relays the voices and narratives of its people and environments, presenting a polyvocal interpretation of one of the most influential towns of the American West. Tailings makes it clear that histories and identities are multiple, communicating an understanding of identity, place, and history as participatory, dynamic, and shared.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Con o Sin Papeles</strong><br/>(W<em>ith or Without Papers</em>)<br/>By Aria Zapata</p>
<p>Labor rights activist Luis Maga&#241;a takes daily drives through the San Joaquin Valley&#8217;s agricultural fields, trips that introduce the audience to the world of migrant work and highlight immense injustices. This documentary tells the stories of Juan and Keyli, who are young and motivated migrant workers. As the two journey on their contrasting paths&#8212;whether to stay or to leave&#8212;Juan and Keyli share sentiments of feeling unwelcome and consigned to outsider status. History repeats itself as tactics of exploitation and abuse are enacted upon a new generation of workers.

Parking in the East Remote lot will be free&#160;on Friday&#160;to accommodate many of those visitors. However, traffic on campus will be much heavier than usual, and parking for many celebrations will be in centrally-located parking lots.&#160;<em><strong>Please consider coordinating with your supervisor to work off-site or from home&#160;on Friday</strong></em>, or consider using alternative transportation to get to campus.&#160;<br/><br/>If you routinely park on campus with a valid A or B parking permit, you should be able to park in the lot you normally use&#160;on Thursday&#160;and&#160;Friday. Display your permit as usual, and please don't park in spaces reserved for VIPs.<br/><br/><strong>Road Closures</strong><br/>Please be aware that Hagar Drive will be closed between the East Remote parking lot and McLaughlin Drive&#160;on Thursday&#160;and&#160;Friday&#160;from&#160;2pm&#8211;5pm, and all day&#160;Saturday&#160;and&#160;Sunday&#160;from&#160;7am&#8211;5pm.&#160;Steinhart Drive will be closed from Hagar Drive to McHenry Library from&#160;2pm&#8211;5pm&#160;on Thursday&#160;and&#160;Friday, and from Hagar Drive to the Core West parking structure from&#160;7am&#8211;5pm&#160;on Saturday&#160;and&#160;Sunday. Vehicles already parked in the Hahn or Quarry Plaza lots will be able to leave during the road closures.&#160;Parking in Quarry Plaza parking lot will be prohibited from&#160;1pm&#8211;5pm&#160;on Thursday&#160;and&#160;Friday, and all day&#160;Saturday&#160;and&#160;Sunday.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Shuttles</strong><br/>Campus shuttles will be operating on the summer intersession Loop bus schedule&#160;on Friday; shuttles will operate every 20 minutes starting at&#160;7:40 a.m., with added evening Loop buses operating until&#160;10 p.m.&#160;During the weekend, campus Loop shuttle service will operate from&#160;7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Metro Buses</strong><br/>Metro service will be reduced on both&#160;Thursday&#160;and&#160;Friday&#160;due to "non-school term" service. TAPS is working with Metro to provide additional buses&#160;on Thursday; any buses added will be listed on the&#160;<a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/metro-june-15.html">TAPS website</a>&#160;as soon as the service is confirmed.&#160;If you plan to come to campus for weekend Commencement activities,&#160;please know that Metro buses serving the UCSC campus will be fare-free&#160;on Saturday&#160;and&#160;Sunday.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Rideshare Services</strong><br/>Rideshare services such as Lyft and Uber will use the Health Center parking lot (Lot 128) throughout the weekend as their sole pick up and drop off location. Both providers will utilize geo-fencing to create a virtual perimeter in order to avoid road closures.<br/><br/>More information, including day-by-day maps showing parking impacts and road closures, is available online at&#160;<a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/event-parking/commencement-parking.html">http://taps.ucsc.edu/event-parking/commencement-parking.html</a>.<br/><br/><br/>Thank you in advance

they create musical instruments to be donated to kids in need.</article-subhead><article-text><p>When it came time to complete her Physics 6B final project, UC Santa Cruz student Asia Stautz turned to an unlikely set of tools.<br/><br/>&#8220;I used a band saw, metal files, a nail gun, and wood glue,&#8221; said the Crown College human biology major, showing off the end result: a cool-looking, handmade ukulele crafted out of recycled wood.<br/><br/>The instrument was a test of Stautz&#8217;s knowledge of standing sound waves and musical acoustics, and&#160;had to be capable of playing a simple tune. But it also was a lesson in giving. The instrument&#8212;part of a class project designed by lecturer Stephanie Bailey&#8212;will later be donated to a small school in an outlying province in the Philippines.<br/><br/>The project, said Bailey from her office on Science Hill, was a way not only to test what her 250 introductory physics students&#8212;most of them life science majors&#8212;have learned, but also to expose them to the larger world.<br/><br/>&#8220;An objective of mine has been to incorporate service learning where you can take advantage or piggyback on the learning goals of the classroom and combine community service in a way that both enhances the educational experience of the students and also brings benefit to the community,&#8221; Bailey said.<br/><br/>For Stautz, who hopes to become an obstetrician, the project meant long hours of planning and ingenuity. Without tools or materials, she talked her way into the campus woodshop, promising volunteer sweeping and cleanup hours in exchange for a chance to raid the scrap bin and use the shop&#8217;s tools.<br/><br/>For Rachel Barocio, a Rachel Carson College molecular, cell and developmental biology major who plans to go on to graduate school, a discarded piece of PVC pipe was turned into a bronze-painted flute. It was, she said, an opportunity to use her artistic side.<br/><br/>&#8220;I enjoyed it (the project) because I consider myself a creative person, and, in sciences, there often can be a lack of creativity,&#8221; she said.<br/><br/>According to Bailey, there has been no lack of creativity and sophistication in her students&#8217; designs, which range from a thumb piano to James Egan&#8217;s drum/xylophone made out of PVC pipe.<br/><br/>A computer science major from Rachel Carson College, Egan said his inspiration came from a video posted by the famed Blue Man Group and that he learned more than just physics from his project.<br/><br/>&#8220;I learned it&#8217;s good to start early and to prototype and plan,&#8221; Egan said. &#8220;Then there&#8217;s the &#8216;measure twice and cut once&#8217; lesson and, one step beyond that, to glue once.&#8221; He grinned.<br/><br/>Tatjana Beck, an ecology and evolution major at Rachel Carson College, found trial and error and a table saw to be important parts of her project. Testing materials like copper, aluminum, and PVC pipe, she finally settled on bamboo to create a vertical xylophone and then had to experiment with the wood&#8217;s range of thick and thin to come up with something that could actually play a tune.<br/><br/>The fact the instruments have to be functional is important, not only for grades, but also for about 60 preschool through sixth-grade students at the Prestige Montessori School in Maasin City in Southern Leyte in the Philippines who will be receiving the finished products. <br/><br/>&#8220;The kids will love them,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Physics Professor David Belanger who, along with his wife, Melca Belanger, built and now support the small private school.<br/><br/>Many of the schools in the area can&#8217;t even afford books, according to Belanger. So the gift of musical instruments, along with knowing that they came from university students, will be a treat for the children, he said.<br/><br/>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re all in positions to help others and make a difference,&#8221; Bailey said. &#8220;I have this greater goal that I would like my students to leave the world a better place than they found it."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f5bb486b807270175cb4ed6b1c011073"><name>nkosi-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Standing tall and giving back</title><summary>For graduating senior Asante Nkosi, a double major in sociology and history allowed him to connect his experiences with his interest in black U.S. history, the Civil Rights Movement, and the contemporary moment.</summary><keywords>nkosi, asante, sociology, uc santa cruz, ucsc, history, graduate</keywords><start-date>1528786800000</start-date><display-name>Nkosi-Profile</display-name><path>/2018/06/nkosi-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/nkosi-profile</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1528836080674</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529962758778</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/nkosi-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/nkosi-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nkosi-400.jpg</name><display-name>nkosi-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>52349</file-size><width>400</width><height>330</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Asante Nkosi</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/nkosi-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/nkosi-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nkosi-80.jpg</name><display-name>nkosi-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7472</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Asante Nkosi</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>"My first year, my RAs really promoted leadership in the black community," said graduating senior Asante Nkosi, photographed outside the Rosa Parks African American Theme House (R.PAATH) at Stevenson College.

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As a tall black man on campus, Asante Nkosi has been asked numerous times by fellow students if he's attending UC Santa Cruz on a basketball scholarship.</p>
<p>"I mean, I like basketball and I play basketball, but we're a Division III school&#8212;we don't even have sports scholarships!," says Nkosi, a graduating senior who's headed to UC Hastings College of Law this fall.</p>
<p>The basketball query hints at assumptions African Americans face all too often, about belonging, merit, and achievement. For Nkosi, a double major in sociology and history allowed him to connect his experiences with his interest in black U.S. history, the Civil Rights Movement, and the contemporary moment. The historical roots of racial, economic, and social inequality illuminate today's injustices&#8212;and fuel his desire to make a positive contribution in the world.</p>
<p>"I want to be a criminal defense attorney. I really want to help the most marginalized, vulnerable people in our society," he said.</p>
<p>In his history courses, Nkosi learned about the forces that concentrated wealth and opportunity along lines of race, gender, and class. In sociology, he studied historical and contemporary portrayals of blacks in media and society. Conversation reflects his concerns: mass incarceration, police brutality, toxic masculinity, and the war on drugs.</p>
<p><strong>From Fresno to Santa Cruz</strong></p>
<p>A Fresno native, Nkosi knew during high school that he wanted to come to UC Santa Cruz, even though African Americans make up only about 3 percent of the student population. Once here, he enjoyed the support of a strong community as a resident of the Rosa Parks African American Theme House (R.PAATH) at Stevenson College.</p>
<p>"My first year, my RAs really promoted leadership in the black community," he said. "They showed us how to balance school and be advocates for our community&#8212;how to be a successful black student on this campus."</p>
<p>Nkosi got a glimpse of that community as a high school senior during an overnight visit to campus sponsored by <a href="https://admissions.ucsc.edu/visit/sio/index.html">Destination Higher Education</a> (DHE), a program coordinated by the Black Student Union that brings newly admitted black high school and transfer students to campus to connect with Afrikan/Black/Caribbean students.</p>
<p>"After that visit, I knew I wanted to come here, because I knew there would be support," said Nkosi, who, as a sophomore, organized the DHE weekend for newly admitted prospective students. "That was my most cherished experience here at UCSC, coordinating that and giving back to a program that did so much for me. DHE taught me about important campus resources and helped me create lifelong friendships. My goal as an organizer was to create a space where students felt welcomed and a sense of belonging, and to give them some resources and advice as they began their journey."</p>
<p>The Black Men's Alliance was another pillar of Nkosi's experience. As co-chair for the last two years, Nkosi facilitated weekly meetings with other black-identified men on campus, and networked with alumni around internships, jobs, and professional development opportunities. "It's a place to express ourselves and talk about issues," he said. Nkosi heard alum Darrick Smith (Oakes College, 1996, sociology), who was a founding member of the alliance in the mid-1990s, speak during his initial campus visit, and Smith's message of inclusion has stayed with him ever since.</p>
<p>"Darrick emphasized that we're not here only for ourselves but as representatives for our community. He said it's important to give back to our community and to recognize those who came before us," said Nkosi. "I've grown so much as a leader. Being a positive role model for younger students is very important."</p>
<p><strong>Giving back</strong></p>
<p>Giving back comes naturally to Nkosi, who started collecting food and blankets for the homeless when he was in elementary school. He spent the summer after his sophomore year interning with <em>Faith in the Valley</em>, a grassroots organization working to make Fresno more equitable. He traversed the city's most blighted neighborhoods to talk to residents and collect data about substandard housing.</p>
<p>"We helped organize students, tenants, and homeowners in Fresno and ultimately passed two city ordinances to improve conditions for renters," he said. Nkosi gave a presentation about the work during the Pacific Sociological Association's 89th Annual Conference.</p>
<p>Nkosi spent last fall in Argentina and Chile as part of the UC Education Abroad Program. He wanted to solidify the Spanish he'd learned in high school, and was drawn to the "Human Rights and Cultural Memory" theme of the coursework. "Both those countries endured military dictatorships, oppression, genocide&#8212;and their military leaders were taught by U.S. agents at a military school in Panama," he said, his voice rising with indignation.</p>
<p>Now, with graduation on the horizon, Nkosi is shifting his focus to preparing for law school. The Division of Social Sciences honored his achievements by bestowing a $4,500 <a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/zimmerman/index.html">Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship</a>. That fund was created in memory of Gabe Zimmerman, an alum who was killed in the 2011 attack on Arizona Congresswoman Gaby Giffords. The support will carry him forward on his path of combatting social and economic injustice.</p>

This training is expected to begin at about 8 a.m. each day, last throughout the day, and end at 6 p.m.<br/><br/>The training is designed to prepare the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, local allied law enforcement agencies, and local fire agencies on how to respond together to an active shooter incident using the latest tactics and equipment available.<br/><br/>As such, some areas around the Baskin Visual Arts and Theater Arts complexes and adjacent parking lots will be cordoned off by yellow tape and signs, and will be off-limits to anyone not participating in the training exercises. A section of Kerr Road will also be closed from the Performing Arts Lot past the Media Theater. The Performing Arts lot will be open for parking.&#160; In addition, those near the area may hear sounds of screaming, simulated gun fire, simulated explosions, and other noises as part of the training.<br/><br/>In addition, we still have a few volunteer opportunities available.&#160; Volunteers allow us to create real life scenarios, thereby enhancing the training experience for all involved.&#160; Anyone interested in volunteering may contact Jason Moore at 831-502-7377 or can send him an email at&#160;<a href="mailto:pdvolunteers@ucsc.edu">pdvolunteers@ucsc.edu</a>.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fa6c6b5d807270175cb4ed6b33f81eea"><name>angela-brooks</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biomolecular engineer Angela Brooks named Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences</title><summary>Brooks will receive a $300,000 award over four years to support her research on how mutations associated with cancer cause changes in gene expression.</summary><keywords>Angela Brooks</keywords><start-date>1528984800000</start-date><display-name>Biomolecular engineer Angela Brooks named Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences</display-name><path>/2018/06/angela-brooks</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/angela-brooks</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1528914798307</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528997194913</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/angela-brooks-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/angela-brooks-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>angela-brooks-350.jpg</name><display-name>angela-brooks-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>60216</file-size><width>350</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt>Angela Brooks</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/angela-brooks-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/angela-brooks-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>angela-brooks-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>angela-brooks-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15028</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Angela Brooks</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Angela Brooks</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Pew Charitable Trusts has named Angela Brooks, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, a Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences. Brooks will receive a $300,000 award over four years to support her research on how mutations associated with cancer cause changes in gene expression.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-biomedical-scholars">Pew Scholars Program in the Biomedical Sciences</a> provides funding to young investigators of outstanding promise in science relevant to the advancement of human health. The program makes grants to selected academic institutions to support the independent research of outstanding individuals who are in the first few years of their appointment at the assistant professor level.</p>
<p>Brooks is an expert in the analysis of RNA sequencing data and is especially interested in the role of RNA splicing in gene expression. When a gene is expressed, its DNA sequence is copied from the chromosome to an RNA molecule, which then undergoes splicing to remove parts of the sequence. Only then can the RNA perform its function and direct the production of a protein. Splicing is governed by a complex regulatory system, and most genes can be spliced in different ways to produce different versions of a protein.</p>
<p>Mutations in the genes that regulate splicing are common in cancer cells. A gene called <em>U2AF1</em>, for example, is mutated in multiple types of cancer, including lung cancer. In previous research, Brooks showed that mutations in this gene lead to aberrant splicing of many RNAs. Now she plans to perform a comprehensive assessment of the effects of <em>U2AF1</em> mutations, determining the sequences of all RNA transcripts produced by cells with the mutated gene.</p>
<p>"We want to get a complete picture of what is being altered by these mutations," Brooks said.</p>
<p>This effort will involve a suite of advanced methods, including nanopore sequencing technology pioneered at UC Santa Cruz. "I was excited to come to UC Santa Cruz in the first place because of the expertise here in nanopore sequencing technology," Brooks said. "There's a great community of researchers here that I can collaborate with."</p>
<p>Nanopore sequencing has several advantages over traditional sequencing technologies, including the ability to directly sequence an entire RNA transcript without chopping it up into smaller segments or making a DNA copy of it. The "long-read" sequences possible with nanopore sequencing will enable Brooks to directly assess the RNA output of the cells.</p>
<p>"We will assess whether alternatively spliced RNA transcripts continue to direct the synthesis of proteins and what effect these RNAs have on the activity of genetic and cellular pathways," she said. "These findings will advance our understanding of how changes in RNA processing affect cell function and could lead to novel approaches for treating diseases, including cancers, in which splicing is abnormal."</p>
<p>Much of this work will involve building the computational tools needed to analyze the data from direct nanopore sequencing of RNA transcripts extracted from cells. The tools Brooks develops will have applications in a wide range of research, but she said it is important to develop them in the context of a specific project.</p>
<p>"Rather than building a hammer and then looking for a nail, I like to couple the tool building with a biological question we're trying to answer. You can build a better tool that way," she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.pewtrusts.org/about/news-room/press-releases-and-statements/2018/06/14/pew-selects-22-scientists-to-investigate-fundamental-biomedical-questions</url><title>Pew Trusts Press Release</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-biomedical-scholars/directory-of-pew-scholars</url><title>2018 Pew Biomedical Scholars</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fb23cec5807270175cb4ed6bf35daa75"><name>therapy-animal-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus review of the proposed UC Santa Cruz Therapy Animal Policy &amp; Procedures</title><summary>The campus invites your comments on the draft Therapy Animal Policy, procedures, and related documents.</summary><start-date>1528927200000</start-date><display-name>Campus review of the proposed UC Santa Cruz Therapy Animal Policy &amp; Procedures</display-name><path>/2018/06/therapy-animal-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/therapy-animal-policy</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1528926817897</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528927757268</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The campus invites your comments on the draft Therapy Animal Policy, procedures, and related documents.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz has been hosting Pause for Paws therapy animal events at McHenry Library and the Science and Engineering Library since 2013.

<p>The study, appearing in the June 13 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13102">online edition</a> of <em>Child Development</em>, found that both Hindu and Muslim children in India thought that Hindu children should follow Hindu norms and Muslim children should follow Muslim norms.</p>
<p>"Even in a region with a long history of high religious tension, we see impressive levels of religious tolerance among children," said study co-author Audun Dahl, assistant professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz. "Children think that people in different religions should follow their own norms&#8212;and that's a starting point, a reason for optimism."</p>
<p>Very little research has been done on how children reason about religious norms, despite the fact that differences between religious norms underpin conflicts around the globe, including Catholic/Protestant clashes in Europe and differences among Sunni and Shia Muslims, noted Dahl. Religious norms dictate practices from clothing and land ownership to reproduction, he said, with adult adherents frequently wanting others to adhere to their norms.</p>
<p>"Children expressed preferences for their own religion, but we found no evidence of children rejecting the norms of the other religion," said Dahl, adding that such tolerance is the first step toward greater harmony.</p>
<p><strong>Exploring religious tolerance</strong></p>
<p>Dahl and coauthors Mahesh Srinivasan at UC Berkeley and Elizabeth Kaplan at Syracuse University wanted to see if children would extend their thinking about their own religious norms to other groups. In other words, would Hindu children think that <em>all </em>children should follow Hindu norms? And would Muslim children believe that <em>all</em> children should follow Muslim norms?</p>
<p>"As it turned out, both Hindu and Muslim children thought that the norms of a religion applied only to followers of that religion. For instance, almost no participants thought Muslim kids should follow Hindu norms, but at least half thought Muslim kids should follow Muslim norms," said Dahl. Rather than applying their own religious norms to all others, children endorsed the right of each religion to have its own religious norms.</p>
<p>The study took place in Gujarat, India, a region with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/06/world/asia/modi-gujarat-riots-timeline.html">history of Hindu-Muslim violence</a>. Investigators worked with 100 children ages 9 to 15, focusing on different Hindu norms, such as the prohibition against eating beef, and Muslim norms, such as the prohibition against worshipping an idol. They also asked the children about hitting people to explore the youngsters' reasoning around moral norms.</p>
<p>"The tendency to restrict the norms of one's own religion only to followers of that religion, and to expect members of another religious group to follow their own customs, may contribute to peaceful coexistence," said Dahl.</p>
<p><strong>Religious norms as distinct from other social norms</strong></p>
<p>The researchers also asked children about moral norms about how to treat others. Fully 95 percent of children&#8212;regardless of religion&#8212;asserted that it's not okay to hit people. Perhaps more surprisingly, most children thought it was wrong to hit someone even if hitting was permitted by religious authorities or a god. Dahl said this speaks to the difference between religious norms and moral norms.</p>
<p>Yet, children also viewed religious norms as different from social conventions or personal preferences. "Religious beliefs are about truth and falsehood. They are about which god, or gods, exist, and which gods are right," he said. "They don't lend themselves to pluralism as easily as personal preferences or social conventions do."</p>
<p>Most religious people believe their god is the true god, so the researchers thought there was a good chance that Hindu children, for example, would think that <em>Muslim </em>children&#8212;as well as Hindu children&#8212;should follow Hindu norms.</p>
<p>"In the Hindu religion, the cow is a holy animal, so you could expect Hindu children to say it is wrong for anyone to kill and eat cows," said Dahl. "But that's not what we found. Most Hindu children thought Muslims could eat beef, and should follow Muslim rather than Hindu norms."</p>
<p>Dahl and Srinivasan plan to further explore how children integrate religious norms as distinct from social norms regarding what's right and wrong, including hitting others. "Religions often aren't explicit about the scope of their norms and whether they apply to non-followers, so there's a question about how children apply the fundamental concepts to actual, complicated scenarios of real life," Dahl said. "It's fascinating."</p>
<p>These findings offer hope that exposure to conflicts over religious differences, like those experienced by children in many regions of the world, need not lead children to develop negative attitudes toward the religious practices of other groups. "Rather, perhaps these levels of understanding will play a role in reducing conflict over time," said Dahl.</p>

<p>Gu also heard a name that stuck with him: David Haussler.</p>
<p>As Gu looked toward college, UC Santa Cruz became a prime destination, given the possibility he could someday work with Haussler, a professor who led the team that in 2000 posted the first publicly available assembly of the human genome sequence online.</p>
<p>Gu toured UC Santa Cruz after getting accepted and arrived in fall 2014 to pursue a degree in bioengineering with a biomolecular concentration. He is this year&#8217;s winner of the Steck Family Award, which honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates.</p>
<p>Loren Steck (Porter '73) was part of the selection committee that chose to recognize Gu's project. The Steck family created the endowment that funds the award.</p>
<p>After his first year, Gu decided to reach out to Haussler to see if he could join his lab. He wasn't sure what to expect. "I heard some professors don't always reply to their email," he said.</p>
<p>Haussler did, putting Gu in touch with Sofie Salama, who brought Gu into the Haussler Wet Lab, where he worked from his sophomore to senior year studying gene regulation in human development.</p>
<p>"I was very honored to be in his lab," Gu said. "I knew how important this lab was."</p>
<p>Gu worked closely with postdoctoral scholar Jason Dionisio Fernandes and lab manager Kristof Tigyi as he learned more about KRAB zinc finger genes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that much about (KRAB zinc fingers) when I joined the lab,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Gu notes that working with stem cells and CRISPR were opportunities only found in a lab environment.</p>
<p>Fernandes said Gu was one of the most dedicated students he&#8217;s ever met.</p>
<p>&#8220;Josh was always willing to take criticism and suggestions and work to make himself a better scientist,&#8221; Fernandes said. &#8220;He made important contributions to a project that studies how genetic elements within the human genome have been battling one another and how these battles have shaped the course of human evolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;His work will be an instrumental part of a publication on the molecular mechanisms of these genetic battles, and his findings will be an important contribution to our understanding of how evolution works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gu, with College 10, graduated in winter 2018 and is set to participate in this weekend's commencement exercises. This fall, he will be at UC Irvine, where he'll be in the cellular and molecular biosciences program to earn a Ph.D. He credits UC Santa Cruz and its supportive community with preparing him for this next step.</p>
<p>"I had some great mentors&#8212;the best in my life," Gu said. "They are people who helped me and supported me."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/josh-gu-feat.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/josh-gu-feat.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>josh-gu-feat.jpg</name><display-name>josh-gu-feat.jpg</display-name><file-size>44841</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Josh Gu will be at UC Irvine this fall to earn a Ph.D.</thumb-alt><title>JOSH GU</title><description>Josh Gu is this year’s winner of the Steck Family Award, which honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year, with the winner chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Queer youth today are in a paradoxical situation: The average age of coming out has dropped to 14 as teens courageously challenge labels of gender and sexual identity. But these young trailblazers are becoming leaders even as they cope with the significant challenges of adolescence. LGBTQ youth are experiencing high levels of depression and suicidal behavior, and they need resources and support to overcome the strain.</p>
<p>That's the message Psychology Professor Phil Hammack delivered to the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine during a recent Washington, D.C., panel discussion focused on "Adolescents in the 21st Century."</p>
<p>"There's a revolution taking place in how people are thinking and talking about gender and sexuality, and the revolution is coming from the bottom up. Teenagers are leading the way," Hammack said after his June 6 appearance. "They are reaping the benefits of expressing themselves more authentically, but they are feeling the burden of educating adults in their schools, families, and culture."</p>
<p>Today's youth are challenging binary thinking and labeling in ways that are leading to an explosion of freedom in identification, said Hammack, a social psychologist at the forefront of scholarship about queer youth. Hammack was invited to participate on a panel focused on the impact of societal and contextual changes on youth; his remarks reflected his findings from an <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/04/hammack-lgbtq.html">in-depth study</a> of more than 300 queer youth in five California counties.</p>
<p>"It's not just gay/straight, and it's not just male/female," said Hammack.</p>
<p>"Labels have always been constraining. Binary thinking forced people into boxes. Young people aren't identifying with those categories."</p>
<p>The internet and social media have enabled queer youth to find each other, giving rise to a community that hasn't been available to prior generations, he said.</p>
<p>In Hammack's research, 24 percent of LGBTQ teens identify as gender non-binary, an identity that signals feeling neither male nor female. Fully 71 percent of teens identify with a non-binary sexual identity, such as pansexual, bisexual, or queer.</p>
<p>"Our ideas about sexuality and gender are changing rapidly, and researchers, teachers, parents, clinicians, and policy makers are lagging behind," said Hammack.</p>
<p>And yet, queer youth are reporting a lot of distress as they face society's persistent stigmas, said Hammack.</p>
<p>"This is the paradox of the cultural change we're seeing," he said. "Young people come out at younger ages and are more courageous and creative about their identities. But this is happening during a developmental period&#8212;adolescence&#8212;that we know is dominated by concerns about peer influence and fitting in. Queer youth continue to experience the stigma of being 'different.' "</p>
<p>LGBTQ youth are twice as likely as straight teens to experience bullying and harassment, and being stigmatized is linked to huge disparities in mental health, said Hammack. Queer youth experience depression at twice the rate of the adolescent population, and lifetime suicidal behavior is nearly eight times more common among queer youth, he said.</p>
<p>But support makes a powerful difference, according to Hammack's research. Supportive families, schools, and communities&#8212;including online communities&#8212;are associated with better mental health outcomes for queer youth.</p>
<p>"The root cause of suffering is the myth that heterosexuality is the ideal/normal, that cisgender identity is the norm," said Hammack, using the term that refers to people whose sense of gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth.</p>
<p>Hammack identified several "action items" to support the social and psychological needs of LGBTQ youth, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A broader societal narrative about sexual and gender identity;</li>
<li>Broadening school curricula to reflect the diversity of sexual and gender diversity;</li>
<li>Adopt anti-bullying programs that explicitly address sexual expression and gender identity, and support nondiscrimination laws that protect LGBTQ students;</li>
<li>Financial support for programs and groups that support queer youth, including gay-straight alliances in schools and community-based organizations</li>
</ul>
<p>Participating on the National Academies' panel felt like a privilege and a responsibility, said Hammack, who spent the 2017-18 year as a fellow of the <a href="https://casbs.stanford.edu/">Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University</a>. "This is a highly influential institution in a place that could actually make a difference in terms of policy and funding," he said. "I felt privileged. I wanted to do justice to the work and the youth."</p>

The honors we received this year reflect this.<br/><br/>We were named among the top 50 global universities, recognized for both impactful research and quality instruction. We were ranked third worldwide for research influence and fifth in the world for space sciences. At the same time, our game-design programs were named among the top in the country. The university itself was recognized as one of the best spots in the U.S. to earn a film, video or photographic-arts degree. That&#8217;s academic breadth.<br/><br/>Our faculty, meanwhile, captured numerous accolades.&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/beth-shapiro-hhmi.html">Beth Shapiro</a>, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, was chosen as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, an honor bestowed on some of the most creative, interdisciplinary scientists working in human health today.&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/leauthaud-sloan-fellowship.html">Alexie Leauthaud</a>, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics, landed two fellowships that honor early-career achievement.&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/04/mangel-amacad.html">Marc Mangel</a>, distinguished research professor of applied mathematics, was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation's oldest and most prestigious honorary societies.&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/national-academy-engineering.html">Two engineers</a>&#160;in our Baskin School of Engineering&#8212;David Haussler, distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering, and Mart&#237;n Abadi, professor emeritus of computer science&#8212;were elected to the National Academy of Engineering, which is among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer. And there were many others.<br/>
<h3>Important work</h3>
Across the divisions, we&#8217;re making our mark.<br/><br/>Rebecca London, assistant professor of sociology, is leading a team of campus social and data scientists on the Silicon Valley Regional Data Trust, a three-county data-sharing partnership that will level the educational playing field for more than 400,000 public-school students in Santa Clara, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz counties.<br/><br/>Our Center for Public Philosophy recently held an Ethics Bowl, a non-confrontational alternative to traditional competitive debate, at San Quentin Prison between a handful of our undergraduates and a team of prison inmates, part of an effort to move philosophy away from tired stereotypes so it can be applied to the crucial problems of today.<br/><br/>Our Institute of the Arts and Sciences, in collaboration with the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum, is right now presenting a work of sonic storytelling, &#8220;FOREST (for a thousand years&#8230;),&#8221; showcasing what you might hear in a forest over hundreds of years.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s bold, creative initiatives like these that are cementing our reputation as one of the top public universities in the country.<br/>
<h3>Plaudits for staff and students</h3>
Our staff and students also collected wide praise this year.<br/><br/><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/doby-award.html">Maria Rocha-Ruiz</a>, executive director of our Educational Partnership Center, took home this year&#8217;s UC systemwide Dr. Winston Doby Impact Award. Judy Scarborough, our Undergraduate Education academic personnel manager, won this year&#8217;s UC Santa Cruz Outstanding Staff Award.<br/><br/><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/leadership-award-ucop.html">Valeria Jacqueline Alonso Blanco</a>, a psychology major graduating this month, was honored with the prestigious UC President&#8217;s Award for Outstanding Student Leadership for her efforts helping first-generation and undocumented students overcome obstacles to transfer to UC Santa Cruz.&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/06/steck-award.html">Josh Gu</a>, a bioengineering major from Los Altos, won this year&#8217;s Steck Award, which recognizes campus&#8217; most outstanding senior research project.<br/>
<h3>Looking ahead</h3>
<p>As the academic year wraps up, we are looking to the future, working diligently to create a campus that helps students, faculty, and staff not only succeed but prosper.<br/><br/>I remain excited by the promise of Student Housing West. It will allow us to aid our students who struggle to find affordable housing in a decidedly unaffordable region, with up to 3,000 beds slated to be built on campus. The child-care facility portion of the project will help more of our employees juggle the difficult tasks of working and parenting.<br/><br/>We continue to craft a new Long Range Development Plan, which is giving us the opportunity to sketch out what our campus might look like in the year 2040.<br/><br/>Our Strategic Academic Plan, meanwhile, an exciting initiative being led by Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp, is moving closer to fruition. It will enable us not only to accentuate what we currently do best, highlighting our work across higher education, but to foster emerging fields.<br/><br/>We are a university going places. Congratulations to all on a great academic year!</p>

<p>Indeed, for many of the approximately 3,200 UC Santa Cruz students in ceremonies this past weekend the occasion marks a culmination&#8212;the final step of a process that began in kindergarten. Many of the Banana Slugs have taken their last test, written their final paper, received one last grade.</p>
<p>But for many the word commencement describes this transformative step perfectly, as the 2018 UC Santa Cruz graduates embark on postgraduate careers, taking the principles, ideas, and relationships they collected during their time in Santa Cruz with them as they start a new chapter in life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure all of us are dreading the fact that we are finally entering the adult world. Who is going to pay for our cell phone bills now?&#8221; quipped Kola Adesina, a Merrill College student who spoke at the college&#8217;s commencement ceremony on Saturday evening. &#8220;We must remember that this isn&#8217;t the end of an era but the start of a new beginning. After all, how can we expect to change the world if we are too afraid to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The concept of new beginnings was a theme returned to over and over by the various commencement speakers that prefaced each ceremony with words of encouragement blended with entreaties for graduates to carry forward both the ideas and ideals they acquired while at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employ your ingenuity and brilliance to try and improve our world,&#8221; said Kingsley Odigie, an environmental scientist who earned his degree from UC Santa Cruz in 2012, during the Graduate Division commencement ceremony on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Odigie also urged graduates to make further strides on the social justice front, with the elimination of systemic racism and crippling economic inequality high on the list of challenges faced by those graduating into the world.</p>
<p>Poet Ziggy Rendler-Bregman, a member of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s first graduating class, offered more personal and reflective advice during her speech for Porter College graduates on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find a way to bring silence and solitude into your life,&#8221; she told the hundreds of gowned graduates huddled under the tent against the cold morning drizzle. &#8220;Build a life where beauty, nature, art, and poetry matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to the nature part, Santa Cruz&#8217;s unpredictable weather played a central role throughout the weekend, with fog rolling off the ocean making for some chilly ceremonies, particularly in the morning. But in true Central Coast style, the sun often broke through, burned off the fog, and displayed the peerless beauty of the UC Santa Cruz campus. The East Field offered some stunning views of the Monterey Bay, while the newly renovated Quarry Amphitheatre provided intimacy as the graduates&#8217; names echoed off the rock walls and the branches of coastal redwoods hanging at the quarry flanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trees were one of the main reasons I came here,&#8221; said Benjamin Stevenson, who received a Master of Arts in education.</p>
<p>It was a refrain through the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the thing I&#8217;ll remember most is just the campus,&#8221; said Maxwell Lee, who earned a Master&#8217;s of Science in applied economics and finance.</p>
<p>Katie Silva-Grizzle said she&#8217;ll always remember the Porter College dorms, not only for the beauty of the setting but also the opportunity to meet people and make friends.</p>
<p>Silva-Grizzle, who graduated with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in cognitive science, wants to teach elementary school. Lee wants to open a restaurant, and Stevenson said he wants to travel while he is young, with plans to visit Thailand and see the rest of the United States.</p>
<p>While many students took time to remember the idyllic setting that framed their college years, some were more intent on savoring the moment after overcoming a series of obstacles on their way to achieving their degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the first one to obtain a bachelor&#8217;s degree within my family,&#8221; said Karla Cruz (Porter College), who graduated with a sociology degree. &#8220;Going to a university, going to a four-year institution, was never in my plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruz wore a dress for graduation with the traditional colors of the Mexican flag stitched horizontally. When her name was called, she twirled to raucous applause.</p>
<p>Cruz, who is undocumented, came to the United States from Mexico when she was 10, endured a hardscrabble youth in East Los Angeles and countless high school counselors who told her she&#8217;d never make it, she would not amount to much, and that she should find low-paying jobs upon graduating high school.</p>
<p>She did not listen and now she will head back to East L.A., degree in hand, with plans to become a high school counselor intent on inspiring young people&#8217;s dreams rather than working to tamp them down.</p>
<p>Cruz&#8217;s optimism about the future both immediate and long-term was shared by others throughout the weekend proceedings, as graduates said they look forward to their next chapter with that bittersweet mixture of excitement and anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m a little bit nervous, but not too concerned,&#8221; said Griffin Dey, who earned a degree in environmental studies on Saturday. He aims to get a job helping identify new sustainable food systems, while helping increase access to food for all. Dey said the friends he made at UC Santa Cruz will be the thing he will remember most about his four years on the hill above the bay, but he also noted that as he seeks to make a positive difference in communities, his time as a Slug has rendered him ready.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1909814b807270175cb4ed6b95945b13"><name>avp-jody-greene</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jody Greene appointed associate vice provost for teaching and learning</title><summary>Jody Greene, professor of literature, feminist studies, and history of consciousness, and director of the Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL), has been appointed associate vice provost for teaching and learning within the Academic Affairs Division.

This appointment is through June 2019.</p>
<p>As part of a restructuring within Academic Affairs, Greene will continue as <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/about/staff.html">CITL director</a>, while also taking on roles with faculty development and student learning assessment. Many of the tasks involved are aligned with the work of the CITL, which has blossomed in its first full year of operation and now provides resources to faculty and graduate students seeking to improve student learning through their work as instructors or teaching assistants.</p>
<p>Greene&#8217;s efficiency and efficacy in building the CITL make her an ideal leader for this next phase. Some of Greene&#8217;s new work will involve helping instructors better understand how to measure student learning, which allows instructors to experiment with new teaching techniques and gauge their effectiveness. Greene will also be supporting research-driven, campus-tailored approaches to sustaining a culture of excellence in teaching and learning at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The restructuring was triggered by the upcoming departure of Associate Vice Provost Martin Berger, who is leaving to be dean of faculty and vice president of academic affairs for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He has ably led the Strategic Academic Planning process, and the campus is grateful for the work he has done in multiple administrative roles.</p>
<p>Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee will oversee the finalization of the <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/index.html">Strategic Academic Plan</a>, as well as its implementation in 2018&#8211;19.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="194a173a807270175cb4ed6b7305c585"><name>outstanding-staff</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>An advocate for instructors and staff</title><summary>Outstanding Staff Award winner Judy Scarborough ensures quality teaching at UC Santa Cruz by keeping human resources seamless. </summary><keywords>judy scarborough, human resources</keywords><start-date>1529391600000</start-date><display-name>scarborough</display-name><path>/2018/06/outstanding-staff</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/outstanding-staff</link><created-by>jhillard</created-by><created-on>1529432641995</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529959681320</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Staff Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.D.

Judy Scarborough, the academic personnel manager for the Division of Undergraduate Education, has worked behind the scenes in a role critical to the courses&#8217; success: making sure instructors&#8217; hiring and payroll goes smoothly.<br/> <br/>Known for generosity with her knowledge and an eye for the details that ensure instructors get paid the right amount and on time, Scarborough is the 2018 Outstanding Staff Award recipient. Human Resources Specialist Lisa Pauken, a colleague, says Scarborough&#8217;s passion for her work is inspiring.<br/><br/>&#8220;Everybody gets the top level of service. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a professor or a newly hired assistant,&#8221; Pauken says, adding that Scarborough wants to help make a process better, help solve a problem, and help somebody learn.</p>
<h3>A wealth of experience</h3>
<p>Scarborough&#8217;s fellow staff wish it were possible to mind-meld with her before she retires next month. She carries a deep well of knowledge from over two decades working at UC Santa Cruz and regularly dips into that well to solve puzzles.<br/> <br/>Pauken says, &#8220;She sits down at the computer with you, and she says, &#8216;Oh, I remember a hire like that!&#8217; and it might be from 20 years ago.&#8221;<br/> <br/>In her previous role in the Humanities Division, Scarborough saw a need to assist the relatively small staffs in the colleges. Over several years, she organized trainings and proposed an office focused on providing ongoing support. The office was established two years ago, with Scarborough overseeing Pauken and another specialist.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Few people have done as much to make sure instructors get paid on time and get paid the correct amount,&#8221; says Alice Folkins, college academic program coordinator for Cowell College. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many times she&#8217;s stopped by my office or picked up her phone to check on me.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Culminating a career</h3>
Scarborough describes her current role as the &#8220;capstone&#8221; of a UC Santa Cruz career that began with a half-time payroll job. In addition to assisting the colleges, she enhances the quality of the teaching by helping Vice Provost of the Division of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey approve the best instructor candidates. She notes that her job gives her opportunities to solve problems and ensure good ideas happen.<br/> <br/>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been bored,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I just think of it as making sure other people&#8217;s money is handled appropriately.&#8221;<br/> <br/>In her early career, she worked in food co-ops and a cooperatively operated bakery in Minneapolis, participating in consensus decision-making with a staff of 40. One day Scarborough noticed a neighborhood bar was not utilizing its kitchen and dining area until the evening. She remembers saying, &#8220;Ok, we shouldn&#8217;t be lazy hippies. We should get up in the morning and start our own breakfast cafe.&#8221; <br/><br/>The cafe and bar are still operating today. Scarborough thinks it's the breakfast service that has kept the shop in business. <br/><br/>"Everybody eats breakfast, even if it's at noon," she says.<br/> <br/>On weekends, Scarborough tends a garden that gives her ready access to beet greens and rhubarb. She traces gardening to her time in Minneapolis.<br/> <br/>&#8220;I remember hearing that people who live in cities don&#8217;t have any idea how to take care of themselves,&#8221; Scarborough says. &#8220;So I started learning how to garden.&#8221;<br/> <br/>For her retirement, Scarborough is looking forward to doing &#8220;anything I want, whenever I want.&#8221; She noted this will include an upcoming sleepover at the Monterey Bay aquarium with her 9-year-old grandson.<br/> <br/>She also plans a trip to Machu Picchu and the Galapagos and a bike tour on the Great River Road following the Mississippi River from Minneapolis to New Orleans.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="19ea4c93807270175cb4ed6b1bee86fb"><name>benner-prop13</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Reforming California's commercial property tax system would boost the economy, report says</title><summary>Reforming California's property tax structure to tax commercial properties at their market value would boost the economy by generating new revenue, stimulating development, and diversifying industry, according to a new report by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>proposition 13, tax, property, commercial, economics, jobs, california, revenue</keywords><start-date>1529391600000</start-date><display-name>Benner-Prop. 13</display-name><path>/2018/06/benner-prop13</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/benner-prop13</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1529443141631</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529606335626</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/benner-prop13_jpg.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/benner-prop13_jpg.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>benner-prop13_jpg.jpg</name><display-name>benner-prop13_jpg.jpg</display-name><file-size>44698</file-size><width>350</width><height>464</height></image><image-alt>Cover of new report</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/benner-prop_13-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/benner-prop_13-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>benner-prop_13-80.jpg</name><display-name>benner-prop_13-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7689</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Headshot of Chris Benner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/benner-prop-13-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/benner-prop-13-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>benner-prop-13-300.jpg</name><display-name>benner-prop-13-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>111618</file-size><width>300</width><height>434</height></image><image-alt>Headshot of Chris Benner</image-alt><image-caption>"As we mark the 40th anniversary of Proposition 13, it's time to look at the legacy it has created in California," says Professor Chris Benner, author of the new report.

<p>The report, "<a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/products/publications/">Market Value: How Fair Assessment of California's Commercial Property Values Would Likely Affect Land Use, Urban Development and the Economy</a>," was issued today (June 19) by the Everett Program for Technology and Social Change at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"As we mark the 40th anniversary of Proposition 13, it's time to look at the legacy it has created in California," said lead author Chris Benner, executive director of the Everett Program and a professor of sociology and environmental studies. "Our analysis identified broad economic benefits of assessing commercial and industrial properties at fair market value&#8212;without changing the system for residential properties."</p>
<p>Benner coauthored the report with Gabriela Giusta, research associate for the Everett Program; Justin Scoggins, data manager at the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity at the University of Southern California, provided assistance with data analysis.</p>
<p>Half of all commercial properties are currently assessed at fair or near fair market value; reforming the system would bring the others up to today's values, said Benner. "Taxing commercial properties at market rates would level the playing field for all land owners and provide a more equitable tax structure for all businesses," he said. "The current system subsidizes older businesses that own their property, creating a competitive disadvantage for businesses that lease or have purchased their property more recently."</p>
<p>Reform would generate an estimated $11.4 billion in new revenue, according to an analysis by contributor Manuel Pastor, professor of sociology and American studies and ethnicity at USC. That figure represents less than .5 percent of the overall state economy, so the overall impact on the economy and jobs is likely to be small, Benner predicted. Additional revenue for local governments would go to education and public services, however, sparking likely increases in spending on infrastructure, as well, said Benner. Ripple effects of reform would likely include cities shifting away from strategies they have adopted to make up for lost revenue, including sales taxes, lodging taxes, utility taxes, and development fees, according to the report.</p>
<p>Paying taxes based on fair market value would also provide an incentive for companies to find ways to generate more revenue from the use of their land, including the development of vacant land and making better use of underutilized land, he said. Underassessment of commercial property values has a "clear and large drag on the development of vacant lots," the report found.</p>
<p>"Our statewide analysis found that vacant properties that were valued closer to market value were five times more likely to be developed than properties whose tax base year was in the 1970s and early 1980s," said Benner.</p>
<p>Small businesses that have owned their property for a long time would have the most difficulty adjusting to being taxed at market-rate property values, said Benner, who<span>&#160;holds the Dorothy E. Everett Chair for Global Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship</span>.</p>
<p>Cities' under-reliance on property tax revenues likely distorts land markets in ways that undermine investment in infrastructure and encourage growth in retail and hospitality industries, which typically have quite low wages, said Benner, an economist who has authored or coauthored six books on employment, economic growth, and social equity. "Reforming commercial property taxes would likely bring in more diverse industries and stimulate economic growth," he said.</p>
<p>The report's conclusions are a significant contribution to the public conversation about the impacts of reforming California's commercial property tax system&#8212;an understudied topic, said Benner. Previous studies have yielded somewhat mixed results, with some predicting slight negative impacts on macro-economic growth and others finding no impact, or a slight positive effect. One prominent 2012 study by the Davenport Institute at Pepperdine University's School of Public Policy estimated that reforms would generate roughly $6 billion annually but also cost nearly 400,000 jobs and $72 billion in lost output. Benner said that study's revenue estimate was reasonable but the estimates of total costs were based on an analysis that was technically flawed and thus highly misleading.</p>
<p>"Those findings echo many public concerns about job losses associated with tax increases, which is why it was worthwhile to review the findings in depth," said Benner. "Overall, we found that reforming the commercial property tax structure would likely have a modest positive impact on the structure and dynamics of California's economy."</p>

Teaching Award in Humanities</strong>&#160;at the Humanities Division&#8217;s 2018 Spring Awards celebration held at the Cowell Provost House.</p>
<p>Established in 2002, the annual award is named in honor of emeritus professor John Dizikes, one of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding faculty members. It is designed to celebrate the Humanities faculty&#8217;s commitment to excellence in teaching and its transformative impact on undergraduate students.</p>
<p>In addition to being honored&#160;with a check for $3,000, the faculty winner is also entitled to select an undergraduate student to receive a $3,000 scholarship. McCloskey chose to split the prize between two senior graduating students in linguistics&#8212;Clara McMahan and Luis Hurtado.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teaching is often painful,&#8221; McCloskey observed, as he accepted the award on the eve of his retirement. &#8220;There is nothing like the pain you feel at the end of those days when it hasn't gone well in the classroom&#8230;But sometimes (the best times) it does work in the room--a real exchange takes place and questions are asked, and a light is lit, and there is excitement around ideas newly experienced.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it's best when it's improvised or unplanned and a student will turn the whole proceeding around by offering, nervously, a question or a suggestion--the one you wanted. Or maybe didn't.&#160;Which you can then grasp and make something of. And in those exchanges the benefits are even, mutual, and reciprocal.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;There are large areas of my own field which I would never have come to properly understand if I hadn't had to, time after time, find new ways to frame them for students who have no reason to react in any other way than with boredom and skepticism,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There is nothing like the thrill of getting past that barrier. And you can't make exchanges like that happen unless you take some chances, open yourself a little, and let bonds of empathy form between you and people with whom you share not very much at all (at least in my own case) of experience or perspective. Which is really why you want to keep doing it and why you're so sad that it has to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Humanities Dean Tyler Stovall hosted the event, noting that the division was presenting two new awards this year: <em>The David A. Kadish Humanities Scholarship Award</em>, which recognizes an undergraduate student with financial need who displays a strong interest in the study of the humanities; and <em>The Idstrom Family Prize for Creative Writing</em>, established by John Idstrom to reward extraordinary accomplishment in creative writing.<br/><br/>The awards celebration also included opening remarks by UC Santa Cruz campus provost and executive vice chancellor Marlene Tromp, who stressed the importance of the humanities in our rapidly changing world.<br/><br/>&#8220;As we watch the #MeToo movement challenge structures of oppression in our culture, as we look at the changing political landscape and see the way we have so many people who lack human understanding, it reminds us how important it is to have humanists asking the questions that humanists ask,&#8221; said Tromp.<br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re the ones who ask those questions. We&#8217;re the ones who challenge those structures. We&#8217;re the ones who think the thoughts that help shift the paradigms.&#8221;<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://reports.news.ucsc.edu/linguistics/</url><title>Why don't we say what we mean?</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a2aff54807270175cb4ed6bc78514dc"><name>alumni-profile-smithers-benjamin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Commencement stories: Benjamin Smithers</title><summary>Benjamin Smithers is a double major in mathematics and physics who is now working on his Ph.D.: an expedition into the world of neutrino physics.</summary><start-date>1529082000000</start-date><display-name> Commencement stories: Benjamin Smithers</display-name><path>/2018/06/alumni-profile-smithers-benjamin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/alumni-profile-smithers-benjamin</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1529447382839</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529448295894</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/benjamin.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/benjamin.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>benjamin.jpg</name><display-name>benjamin.jpg</display-name><file-size>128622</file-size><width>400</width><height>481</height></image><image-alt>Benjamin Smithers, Merrill '18.</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Merrill ’18, mathematics and physics

<p>&#8220;It was an honor working alongside the wonderful faculty and community at UC Santa Cruz; an experience that let me loose into the great playground of physics. I spent much of my time investigating the effects of highly energetic debris from particle collisions on silicon sensors. Using what I have learned so far, I am beginning work on my Ph.D.: an expedition into the exciting and exotic world of neutrino physics. I hope to continue this work for many years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benjamin Smithers (pictured here at the European Organization for Nuclear Research [CERN] in Switzerland) is a double major in mathematics and physics. He received the coveted Dean&#8217;s Award/Chancellor's Award for his senior thesis &#8220;Operation of the Prospective SiD BeamCal in the Expected High-Radiation Forward Environment of the ILC." Upon graduation, Smithers (Merrill) starts a new job at CERN in Switzerland as a DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) researcher.</p>

Participants in this year's program presented their finished work at Partner's Day on Tuesday, June 5. The projects included a system to detect foreign objects in a produce processing line and technology to support automation in construction vehicles.</p>
<p>Throughout the academic year, students in the program interact with teammates, sponsors, and faculty. Some make visits to their corporate sponsor&#8217;s worksite, and all are required to solve problems along the way. By working with mentors at corporate partner companies, students learn important skills, take on interesting challenges, and begin to understand what it means to be a professional engineer.</p>
<p>This year's sponsors included Topcon Positioning Group, a provider of high-precision positioning technology using global navigation satellite systems for construction, geopositioning, and precision agriculture. Among Topcon&#8217;s offerings are several applications that support automation in construction vehicles. Students James Trombadore, David Kooi, Kiefer Selmon, and Donald Avansino worked with Topcon to research and develop technology that would enable a bulldozer to autonomously identify, approach, and dig a stockpile at a construction site.</p>
<p>Topcon provided the team with a small-scale bulldozer prototype called the HouseCat mkII. The students had just four months to create the technology that would give this prototype its autonomous functionality.</p>
<p>The team broke the problem down into three distinct components: identifying and aligning with a stockpile; determining the optimal approach to the stockpile; and performing and verifying the dig. They mapped out a solution that relied on sophisticated concepts from computer science and engineering, including machine learning, computer vision and neural networks.</p>
<p>Faculty mentor David Munday said he was was happy with the team&#8217;s results. &#8220;The key innovation our students produced this year is the creative use of cutting edge computer vision techniques to overcome sensory limitation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unlike standard autonomous vehicle sensing systems, this system does not have expensive proximity sensors, LIDAR, or even weight sensors to aid in bucket load detection. Like a human being that loses one of their senses, the students&#8217; vision algorithms became sharper to adapt beyond those limitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donna Kelley, senior product design engineer at Topcon, said working with the students was inspirational. &#8220;The engineers who worked with the students were energized. And the students learned a lot about real-world integration and about how engineering works in the real world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to do this again. It was a great experience. We all got a lot of out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another project was sponsored by Atollogy, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) software company that offers proprietary algorithms and capabilities for managing operations by integrating the physical world with artificial intelligence. Students An Tran, David Munoz, Cesar Neri, Kevin Ajili, Eric Su, and Arindam Sarma worked with Atollogy on research that analyzes data from production lines.</p>
<p>The team spent their first CSSPP quarter working to help an Atollogy customer understand the flow and activity of cement trucks in their yard. Using advanced image-recognition algorithms, the students researched and tested methods of license plate recognition, providing Atollogy insight into the most effective solutions to their problem.</p>
<p>The team then worked with Atollogy on the &#8220;Greens Only&#8221; project, the goal of which was to find an efficient and effective way to identify foreign objects in a produce production line. The team focused on building an automated detection system specifically for spinach. Because spinach is always a uniform green color, foreign objects, which will almost always be some color other than green, are easier to identify.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the solution depended on a combination of hardware and software solutions with computer vision algorithms. To replicate conditions in the real facility, the students had to create their own data in order to test the software.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to research different environmental conditions, foreign objects, and contaminants,&#8221; said Cesar Neri. &#8220;To do this, we needed to create our own &#8216;contaminated spinach&#8217; images.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although challenging, working on the project was rewarding because the students were able to experience working closely with a Silicon Valley company, and they were able to see the results of their hard work implemented in technology used by Atollogy. The project also provided the opportunity for networking, and three members of the research team will intern with Atollogy this summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a really cool experience because it was my first time doing practical work for a real company,&#8221; said Kevin Ajili. &#8220;Seeing my work, time, and effort going into something that&#8217;s not just a grade felt really good. It was probably the most important experience during my studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Atollogy was pleased with the accomplishments of the students. &#8220;The students have been wonderful to work with,&#8221; said Anthony Tarantino, founding member and senior advisor to Atollogy. &#8220;They were not afraid to take on what is a very complex problem. They've been enthusiastic, professional, and well-organized throughout the project.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tarantino, who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1971, said, "It's great to come back and bring a project like this to fruition.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Atollogy and Topcon, the corporate sponsors of student projects this year included Amazon Lab 126, Kateeva, Mira Bella Energy, Nanometrics Incorporated, Nevro Corporation, Oracle Labs, and Seagate Technology PLC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="25010111807270175cb4ed6b6cfdb330"><name>arts-students-indiecade</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Five UC Santa Cruz students present futuristic game at IndieCade Showcase </title><summary>A group of five students from UC Santa Cruz presented their game, "Meet Me in the Garden," at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles last week as part of the annual IndieCade Showcase.</summary><start-date>1529631600000</start-date><display-name>Arts students at IndieCade Showcase </display-name><path>/2018/06/arts-students-indiecade</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/arts-students-indiecade</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1529629179084</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529711933926</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/garden-banner-425.png</path><link>site://news/2018/06/garden-banner-425.png</link><site>news</site><name>garden-banner-425.png</name><display-name>garden-banner-425.png</display-name><file-size>217636</file-size><width>425</width><height>239</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz video game banner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/arts-indiecade-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2018/06/arts-indiecade-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>arts-indiecade-thumb.png</name><display-name>arts-indiecade-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>33049</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz video game banner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/indiecade-showcse-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/indiecade-showcse-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>indiecade-showcse-400.jpg</name><display-name>indiecade-showcse-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>185099</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>UCSC students at E3 IndieCade Showcase</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A group of five students from UC Santa Cruz presented their game, <em>Meet Me in the Garden</em>, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles last week as part of the annual IndieCade Showcase.</p>
<p>Now in its second decade, IndieCade, is the largest independent games festival in the country, celebrating games from around the globe.</p>
<p><em>Meet Me in the Garden</em> was created in a class titled "Speculative Futures: Games for a Different World," taught by Marcelo Viana Neto, a lecturer for the <a href="http://games.arts.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Art and Design: Games and Playable Media</strong></em></a> program (AGPM) in the UCSC Arts Division.<br/><br/>The students were asked to choose a major socio-political issue to research&#8212;such as racism, gender discrimination, or classism&#8212;and create a vision for the world where these issues have been resolved. After an initial research phase, they designed and produced original games for their imagined future.<br/><br/><em>Meet Me in the Garden</em> is a cooperative puzzle-based narrative-building game that encourages a genuine connection between players. It is an exploration of queer play and imagining a future in which traditional labels (sexuality, gender, etc.) are eradicated, so every individual can be seen as equal. <br/><br/>&#8220;This game is emblematic of the type of work we're hoping to produce in the major: a visually rich non-traditional game experience that explores personal identity, incorporates a novel mix of analog, digital, and installation elements, and promotes player communication, cooperation, and empathy,&#8221; noted AGPM program manager Bennett Williamson. <br/><br/>&#8220;It is extra impressive that this group was accepted to IndieCade as they are undergraduates competing with graduate student work,&#8221; he added. "Their game was shown at E3 as part of the IndieCade Showcase, and will be shown again during the main IndieCade Festival in Los Angeles in October.&#8221;<br/><br/>The team of 5 UC Santa Cruz students included Liam Dugard, Yani Fauzi, Reno Rivera, Emily Rodriguez, and Caleb Valdez. The group received $2,500 in funding from the Arts Dean's Fund for Excellence in support of exhibiting the work at the festival events. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=25&amp;v=oh2iIhG-Grk">WATCH TRAILER</a> for <strong>&#8220;Meet Me in the Garden"</strong></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="289d034f807270175cb4ed6b6b1a52e9"><name>feldl-career-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Climate scientist Nicole Feldl wins NSF CAREER Award</title><summary>NSF grant includes funding for climate research and for a cross-disciplinary environmental game project for students to develop a learning game about climate science.</summary><keywords>Nicole Feldl, Elizabeth Swensen, climate change</keywords><start-date>1529650800000</start-date><display-name>Climate scientist Nicole Feldl wins NSF CAREER Award</display-name><path>/2018/06/feldl-career-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/feldl-career-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1529689734928</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529690131365</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/nicole-feldl-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/nicole-feldl-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nicole-feldl-350.jpg</name><display-name>nicole-feldl-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>88122</file-size><width>350</width><height>449</height></image><image-alt>Nicole Feldl</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/nicole-feldl-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/nicole-feldl-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>nicole-feldl-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>nicole-feldl-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19231</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Nicole Feldl</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Nicole Feldl</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Grant includes funding for climate research and for a cross-disciplinary environmental game project for students to develop a learning game about climate science</article-subhead><article-text><p>Nicole Feldl, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support her research on climate change.</p>
<p>Feldl's research focuses on understanding the mechanisms driving the amplification of global warming in the Arctic, where widespread summer melting of sea ice and warming winters are having far-reaching effects on ecosystems and economies.</p>
<p>The project also includes an outreach and education component in which Feldl will work with a team of undergraduates, in collaboration with Elizabeth Swensen, assistant professor of art and design: games and playable media, to develop a learning game about climate science.</p>
<p>The CAREER Awards are NSF's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. The award provides $800,000 over five years to support Feldl's research, education, and outreach activities.</p>
<p><strong>Polar amplification</strong></p>
<p>The Arctic is warming much faster than other parts of the planet, and this "polar amplification" of global warming is a robust prediction of global climate models. But climate scientists don't yet fully understand the complex interactions between the atmosphere and ocean that produce this effect.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, we're trying to understand the sensitivity of the Earth's climate system to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, both in the global sense (that is, how much the average global temperature will increase for a given increase in greenhouse gases) and in terms of large-scale patterns of climate change," Feldl explained. "Understanding the physical processes, and how they&#8217;re represented in models, helps us reduce the uncertainty in the projections of what climates we might see in the future."</p>
<p>The implications of Arctic amplification of surface warming extend far beyond the Arctic because of the influence Arctic temperatures have on the jet stream and weather patterns across North America and Europe. Feldl will perform a series of experiments using climate models of increasing complexity designed to test the influence of different processes on Arctic amplification.</p>
<p><strong>Learning game</strong></p>
<p>For the outreach and education component, Feldl and Swensen will recruit a team of undergraduates to develop a learning game that can be used to teach K-12 students about climate science. The aim is to produce a science-based game that teaches players about the Earth's climate system by incorporating climate physics into the game mechanics. The grant includes funding for a graduate student who will oversee pilot studies to observe game play and gather feedback, as well as assessments of the game's effectiveness as a learning tool.</p>
<p>Swensen is an award-winning game designer with extensive experience developing educational games. Her recent work includes a NASA-funded game about microbial life for 7th- and 8th-grade classrooms.</p>
<p>"A game can have serious content and still be engaging," Swensen said. "This project offers a unique opportunity for undergraduates to develop a game for a targeted audience and with an intended outcome, where the practice of playing the game reinforces the material we want users to learn. I look forward to seeing what the students are able to make."</p>
<p>Feldl said she is excited about the collaboration with Swensen, noting that NSF only recently allowed applicants to add a faculty associate to a CAREER grant. "There's a lot of enthusiasm across campus for 'games for change' that tackle environmental issues. I'm grateful for the NSF's support of the collaboration, and I can't imagine a better home for it than Santa Cruz," she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="291992ef807270175cb4ed6b7edcb152"><name>leauthaud-doe-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomer Alexie Leauthaud wins DOE Early Career Award</title><summary>The award from DOE's Early Career Research Program supports Leauthaud's research on dark energy.</summary><keywords>Alexie Leauthaud, dark energy</keywords><start-date>1529935200000</start-date><display-name>Astronomer Alexie Leauthaud wins DOE Early Career Award</display-name><path>/2018/06/leauthaud-doe-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/leauthaud-doe-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1529697897620</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529939108242</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</name><display-name>alexie-leauthaud-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>119835</file-size><width>375</width><height>449</height></image><image-alt>Alexie Leauthaud</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/10/images/alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alexie-leauthaud-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20090</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alexie Leauthaud</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Alexie Leauthaud</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Alexie Leauthaud, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, is among 84 scientists selected by the Department of Energy (DOE) to receive funding through DOE's Early Career Research Program.</p>
<p>The award provides $750,000 over five years to support Leauthaud's research on dark energy. Pinning down the nature of dark energy is one of the most pressing questions in modern physics. Several large missions that will address dark energy are currently under way or will begin in the next 6 years, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) survey, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).</p>
<p>Leauthaud is among the few scientists with joint membership in DESI, LSST, and HSC, giving her access to key data sets for her research. These missions aim to measure the properties of dark energy in different but complementary ways. DESI will measure the distances to tens of millions of galaxies. LSST and HSC are imaging surveys (large maps of the sky that reveal millions of galaxies) and are designed to measure gravitational lensing, the distortion of galaxy shapes due to the bending of space-time by intervening dark matter.</p>
<p>Leauthaud plans to take advantage of the synergies between these different approaches and data sets in order to increase their scientific payoff. Her research will advance our understanding of dark energy as well as the theory of gravity, and will provide robust constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model.</p>
<p>The DOE Early Career Research Program is designed to bolster the nation&#8217;s scientific workforce by providing support to exceptional researchers during the crucial early career years, when many scientists do their most formative work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supporting talented researchers early in their career is key to building and maintaining a skilled and effective scientific workforce for the nation. By investing in the next generation of scientific researchers, we are supporting lifelong discovery science to fuel the nation&#8217;s innovation system,&#8221; said energy secretary Rick Perry. &#8220;We are proud of the accomplishments these young scientists have already made, and look forward to following their achievements in years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leauthaud was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship earlier this year and received a Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering in 2017. She earned her M.S. at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris and her Ph.D. at the Laboratory of Astrophysics in Marseille, both in astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz in 2016, she was a researcher at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Tokyo.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2939d01f807270175cb4ed6b6fca910a"><name>electrogeochemistry</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Electrogeochemistry' captures carbon, produces fuel, offsets ocean acidification</title><summary>Researchers analyzed the global potential for 'negative emissions energy' using electricity from renewable sources to generate hydrogen fuel and capture carbon dioxide.</summary><keywords>Greg Rau</keywords><start-date>1529938800000</start-date><display-name>'Electrogeochemistry' captures carbon, produces fuel, offsets ocean acidification</display-name><path>/2018/06/electrogeochemistry</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/electrogeochemistry</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1529700010940</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1531257843583</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/greg-rau-253.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/greg-rau-253.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>greg-rau-253.jpg</name><display-name>greg-rau-253.jpg</display-name><file-size>45100</file-size><width>253</width><height>240</height></image><image-alt>Greg Rau</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/greg-rau-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/greg-rau-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>greg-rau-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>greg-rau-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14891</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Greg Rau</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Greg Rau</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Researchers analyze global potential for 'negative emissions energy' using electricity from renewable sources to generate hydrogen fuel and capture carbon dioxide</article-subhead><article-text><p>Limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius will require not only reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, but also active removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This conclusion from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has prompted heightened interest in "negative emissions technologies."</p>
<p>A new study <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0203-0">published June 25 in <em>Nature Climate Change</em></a> evaluates the potential for recently described methods that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through an "electrogeochemical" process that also generates hydrogen gas for use as fuel and creates by-products that can help counteract ocean acidification.</p>
<p>First author Greg Rau, a researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz and visiting scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said this technology significantly expands the options for negative emissions energy production.</p>
<p>The process uses electricity from a renewable energy source for electrolysis of saline water to generate hydrogen and oxygen, coupled with reactions involving globally abundant minerals to produce a solution that strongly absorbs and retains carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Rau and other researchers have developed several related methods, all of which involve electrochemistry, saline water, and carbonate or silicate minerals.</p>
<p>"It not only reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide, it also adds alkalinity to the ocean, so it's a two-pronged benefit," Rau said. "The process simply converts carbon dioxide into a dissolved mineral bicarbonate, which is already abundant in the ocean and helps counter acidification."</p>
<p>The negative-emissions energy approach that has received the most attention so far is known as "biomass energy plus carbon capture and storage" (BECCS). This involves growing trees or other bioenergy crops (which absorb carbon dioxide as they grow), burning the biomass as fuel for power plants, capturing the emissions, and burying the concentrated carbon dioxide underground.</p>
<p>"BECCS is expensive and energetically costly. We think this electrochemical process of hydrogen generation provides a more efficient and higher capacity way of generating energy with negative emissions," Rau said.</p>
<p>He and his coauthors estimated that electrogeochemical methods could, on average, increase energy generation and carbon removal by more than 50 times relative to BECCS, at equivalent or lower cost. He acknowledged that BECCS is farther along in terms of implementation, with some biomass energy plants already in operation. Also, BECCS produces electricity rather than less widely used hydrogen.</p>
<p>"The issues are how to supply enough biomass and the cost and risk associated with putting concentrated carbon dioxide in the ground and hoping it stays there," Rau said.</p>
<p>The electrogeochemical methods have been demonstrated in the laboratory, but more research is needed to scale them up. The technology would probably be limited to sites on the coast or offshore with access to saltwater, abundant renewable energy, and minerals. Coauthor Heather Willauer at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory leads the most advanced project of this type, an electrolytic-cation exchange module designed to produce hydrogen and remove carbon dioxide through electrolysis of seawater. Instead of then combining the carbon dioxide and hydrogen to make hydrocarbon fuels (the Navy's primary interest), the process could be modified to transform and store the carbon dioxide as ocean bicarbonate, thus achieving negative emissions.</p>
<p>"It's early days in negative emissions technology, and we need to keep an open mind about what options might emerge," Rau said. "We also need policies that will foster the emergence of these technologies."</p>
<p>In addition to Rau and Willauer, coauthor Zhiyong Jason Ren at the University of Colorado in Boulder (now at Princeton University) also contributed to the paper. This work was supported by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Office of Naval Research, and National Science Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="37bec488807270175cb4ed6ba92c14d1"><name>staff-appreciation-picnic</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff Appreciation Picnic this Wednesday</title><summary>The Staff Advisory Board will be hosting the Staff Appreciation Picnic this Wednesday, June 27th, from 11:30am-1:30pm in the newly renovated Quarry Amphitheater.</summary><start-date>1529942400000</start-date><display-name>Staff Appreciation Picnic this Wednesday</display-name><path>/2018/06/staff-appreciation-picnic</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/staff-appreciation-picnic</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1529943606375</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1529943756795</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>A friendly reminder that the Staff Advisory Board will be hosting the Staff Appreciation Picnic this&#160;Wednesday, June 27th, from&#160;11:30am-1:30pm&#160;in the newly renovated&#160;Quarry Amphitheater.<br/><br/>Also, if you were unable to attend or join the live stream for the Leadership Forum in the spring quarter, the entire video can be viewed using the following link:&#160;<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/WfRRwzKR4We">http://www.ustream.tv/channel/WfRRwzKR4We</a></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>All UCSC Staff</audience><admin>Michael Luttrell, Chair Staff Advisory Board</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3cd64f5c807270175cb4ed6bab7a014f"><name>whistleblower-protection-act</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California Whistleblower Protection Act - Annual Notice</title><summary>The University’s Whistleblower Policy provides multiple avenues for employees to bring forward concerns of potential employee misconduct.

<p>The award, established by the White House in 1995, recognizes mentors working to ensure that tomorrow's scientists and engineers will better represent the nation's diverse population. The award honors people and programs that have demonstrated excellence in mentoring individuals from groups that are underrepresented in STEM education and the workforce.</p>
<p>"Our mentoring focuses on coaching students to think and work like engineers or scientists, and how to become a valued member of a team," said Lisa Hunter, director of the institute. Hunter and Jerome Shaw, emeritus associate professor of education, accepted the award during a ceremony in Washington, D.C. Awardees receive a $10,000 award, a commemorative certificate, and invitations to participate in meetings with STEM education, research, and policy leaders.</p>
<p>Based in the Division of Social Sciences, the Institute for Scientist &amp; Engineer Educators (ISEE) prepares scientists and engineers at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels to be effective and inclusive, with an emphasis on teaching, mentoring, and collaboration. ISEE offers programs at UC Santa Cruz, as well as at universities across the country.</p>
<p>The institute received the award for its work developing a local science and engineering workforce for observatories on Hawaii&#8217;s Mauna Kea and Haleakala summits. ISEE's Akamai Internship Program offers intensive training in problem solving and communications skills that are highly valued by employers, said Hunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Local workforce development is crucial to the success of telescopes in Hawaii, and mentoring is one of the most effective ways to bring young people into the workforce," said Hunter.</p>
<p>ISEE is the legacy of the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) at UC Santa Cruz, where the Akamai Program was developed along with programs that train future faculty members to be inclusive educators and mentors. With hundreds of ISEE alumni working in professions across the country, the institute is poised to expand its influence through a national network of chapters, said Hunter.</p>
<p>In addition to the Division of Social Sciences, the institute receives support from the Physical and Biological Sciences Division, the Baskin School of Engineering, the Division of Graduate Studies, and the University of California Observatories. External funders include the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory (TIO), the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, and the Hawaii Community Foundation.</p>

We&#8217;ve reached campus consensus on our design principles; catalyzed vital interdisciplinary plans for collaboration among researchers; begun to think about ways to reduce or eliminate campus barriers that stand in the way of research, teaching, and learning; and are well on our way to developing a draft of the plan for review by the Academic Senate this summer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m inspired by the energy and dedication of the thousands of campus stakeholders who have participated in one-on-one interviews, group meetings, open forums, online discussions, workshops, and senate review. The senate, in particular, has been an early and productive partner. I wish to acknowledge the tireless work of Chair Olof Einarsd&#243;ttir, Vice Chair Kim Lau, and Committee on Planning and Budget Chair Carl Walsh. I hope those who have questions about process or the outcomes will remain in dialogue with us. Strategic planning is an ongoing process that must remain active to remain relevant, and I look forward to continuing the conversation with all of you.</p>
<h3>Academic priority areas</h3>
<p>The chancellor and I are now studying all the the feedback to identify strategic academic areas for investment, after having reviewed detailed feedback on the Themed Academic Working Groups (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y89-3uAyfhdNCw5Y623vAz5jL3fMkPBtQYAihlGrpfI/edit#gid=1692295789">TAWGs</a>) from individual faculty, students, and staff, as well as the&#160;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TGltqw0lQrqMzxHpPP14VXX4oFwi1WTm">Library</a>,&#160;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ef4fSrVaSfCmTnnTBaxZoiboHDpv56xY">Information Technology Services</a>, Academic Senate (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JJEuW9UYL1_clITgf79HPFgk9ppk6aL0">cover letter</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DMsjET_DmezAKRgv9vn3Dl_e_0xCzMFf">individual committee letters</a>), and the&#160;<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ojnx96nSmheX7jiKv4OhXiWeWlNRmz-l">Academic Advisory Committee</a>. Supporting specific areas does not mean we will no longer support the rest of the university. To remain a vital university with a rich academic experience, we must continue to have breadth and depth of research and curriculum. The goal of designating priority areas is to support distinctive, interdisciplinary areas that span our academic divisions.</p>
<p>It is important to note the chancellor and I are impressed with the exceptional quality of many of the TAWGs and will seek ways to nurture a number of exciting initiatives that have the potential to enrich our university, our faculty, and our students. We remain committed to providing our undergraduates with a comprehensive education with excellence in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate student survey</h3>
<p>We recently completed a survey of all undergraduates to better understand how we can serve their academic needs. The survey questions grew out of feedback received in a series of one-on-one interviews our consultants conducted with a cross-section of our students. The subsequent survey draft was shared with several Student Union Assembly officers and student groups for feedback. The survey was conducted between May 15 and June 5. In an effort to improve our response rate, we took student suggestions to promote it through social media, by tabling in Quarry Plaza, and by providing the chance for survey participants to win prizes. I&#8217;m delighted to report 1,071 students completed the survey, roughly 6.5 percent of all undergraduates on campus, a high rate of participation for an administrative survey. As soon as the results are analyzed, we will post them on the&#160;<a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/index.html">SAP website</a>.</p>
<h3>Design principles</h3>
<p>With input from our campus community over several months, we developed, debated, and honed our design principles: clear, tightly defined guidelines that identify our institutional aspirations. The chancellor and I recently shared the final design principles to campus.</p>
<ol>
<li>Drive research and creative work that transforms our world.</li>
<li>Create enriching experiential learning and research opportunities for students.</li>
<li>Engage and support a diverse faculty, staff, and student body.</li>
<li>Support generative interdisciplinary connections in research and teaching.</li>
<li>Expand excellence and innovation in areas distinctive to UC Santa Cruz, such as social. justice, diversity, and sustainability.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Open forums</h3>
<p>On May 23 and 24, we hosted 55 faculty, staff, and students at two open forums on strategic academic planning. During the events, Associate Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Martin Berger provided updates on the work accomplished, explained next steps, and took audience questions. The meeting notes and slides are available, along with all others, under Working Documents on the <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/comms-reports.html">SAP Communications and Reports&#160;webpage</a>.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Over the coming weeks, we will announce our academic priority areas; engage the Implementation Working Group to develop roadmaps for reducing or eliminating key campus barriers; and release the draft plan and implementation playbook.</p>
<p>This summer, the Academic Senate will review the plan, so that we have time to respond to its feedback in September, before the start of the new academic year. Over the course of the 2018-19 academic year, we will begin the exciting work of implementation, under the guidance of Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee.</p>
<h3>My special thanks</h3>
<p>I am grateful to Martin for his leadership in strategic academic planning. He has invested enormous time, energy, and heart in this process. He has been ably supported by Special Projects Manager Andrea Cohen, who coordinated all aspects of the planning process. Andrea will continue work on strategic planning next year under Herbie.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3e44f4a3807270175cb4ed6b2cf187e0"><name>rich-invited-academy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>B.

Ruby Rich has been invited to join the&#160;<a href="http://www.oscars.org"><em><strong>Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</strong></em></a>&#160;this year.</p>
<p>The world's preeminent film organization, the Academy is made up of more than 8,000 distinguished members working in cinema.&#160;Open to qualified filmmakers around the world, it is best known for presenting the annual Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Rich is the author of several books on film, including <em>New Queer Cinema: The Director's Cut</em>, and&#160;<em>Chick Flicks: Theories and Memories of the Feminist Film Movement</em>.</p>
<p>She is also the editor of <em>Film Quarterly</em>, the academic film journal of the University of California Press. Established in 1958, the peer-reviewed journal examines all aspects of film history, film theory, and the impact of film, video and television on culture and society.<br/><br/>As a film critic, Rich has been a programmer and juror at major film festivals around the world and has been published in <em>The Guardian</em> (UK), <em>The Village Voice</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em>. She has also provided film commentary for <em>NPR&#8217;s All Things Considered</em> and the <em>Criterion Collection</em>.<br/><br/>In 2012, she received the Frameline Award at the 36th San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival, an honor awarded annually to a person who has made a major contribution to LGBT representation in film, television, or the media arts.<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known Ruby Rich for 30 years as a brilliant scholar, critic, film advocate, and expert in social documentary film,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz dean of the arts Susan Solt. &#8220;There is no one more deserving of this honor than Ruby; it is high time.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;She represents one of the most committed members of our faculty,&#8221; Solt added. &#8220;Her loyalty and concern for her students, and her connections in the industry and independent film world, make her an extraordinary asset to the campus. It is through her dogged efforts that we can now say that we are in the first year of a singular M.F.A. program in Social Documentation, which brings us great renown.&#8221;<br/><br/>Last summer, a four-day event titled <em>Being Ruby Rich</em> paid tribute to Rich&#8217;s work through multiple film screenings and panel discussions at at the Barbican Centre in London. Rich delivered the keynote address and also attended a one-day symposium in her honor titled "Being Ruby Rich: Film Curation as Advocacy and Activism," presented by Birkbeck, University of London.<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/alums-film-academy.html</url><title>Seven alumni invited to join Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/06/ruby-rich-london.html</url><title>London’s Barbican Centre celebrates career of film professor B.

The policy underscores UC&#8217;s commitment to compliance with U.S. export control laws and regulations, which define the conditions under which certain information, technologies, and commodities can be exported overseas to anyone, including U.S. citizens, or shared with a foreign national within the United States.</p>
<p>The policy is <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2000676/ECP">available online</a>.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, the Office of Research is building an export control program to enhance resources and tools to support the campus community in international research activities. These resources and tools are intended to help members of the campus community be aware of potential issues and seek the advice of the Export Control Office to determine license requirements, obtain required licenses, and provide assistance with technology control plan requirements.</p>
<p>Typical UC Santa Cruz transactions or activities that may have export control implications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>collaborating with a foreign institution, person, or entity;</li>
<li>shipping or hand carrying equipment, items, samples or controlled data internationally;</li>
<li>receiving export controlled data, materials, or research samples;</li>
<li>agreements that include publication or foreign national restrictions;</li>
<li>foreign national&#8217;s access to export controlled items or information; or</li>
<li>transactions or international travel involving sanctioned countries such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.</li>
</ul>
<p>Export controls are laws that aim to protect national security, economic interest, and support foreign policy. Export control is a shared responsibility and violations for the U.S. export control regulations can result in personal and institutional liability, including fines and imprisonment. UC Santa Cruz is committed to providing assistance to researchers to comply the U.S. export control regulations.</p>

<p>Focusing on what autistic people have to say about their own experiences, the authors explore four behaviors that are common among people with autism&#8212;low eye contact, infrequent pointing, repetitive movements, and echolalia, which is the verbatim repetition of words and phrases&#8212;and offer alternative explanations for each behavior.</p>
<p>"We believe the most effective interventions will involve teaching both autistic and non-autistic people to recognize each other&#8217;s social signals, rather than insisting that autistics behave like non-autistics do," said Jaswal.</p>
<p>Many autistic people express a deep longing for social connection, according to Akhtar and Jaswal, who illuminate alternative explanations for why autistics behave in ways that non-autistics interpret to mean they are socially uninterested.</p>
<p>Low eye contact could be because some autistics say they find it hard to pay attention to what someone is saying while looking at them, according to the authors. &#8220;Ironically,&#160;<em>not</em>&#160;looking someone in the eye may actually mean that they are trying very hard to pay attention and to participate in the conversation even though it can get interpreted in the opposite way,&#8221; Akhtar said.</p>
<p>When it comes to infrequent pointing, Jaswal said lots of autistics have explained&#8212;and research supports&#8212;that they experience difficulty in getting their body to do what they want it to do.</p>
<p>"In the case of pointing, they might want to share something interesting with someone else, but simply cannot put together or carry out the complex motor plan that&#8217;s needed to do that," he said.</p>
<p>Many people engage in repetitive movements like tapping their feet or twirling a pencil when they're anxious or bored, regardless of whether they have a diagnosis of autism, the authors pointed out. Some autistics explained that they find these behaviors comforting and in some cases simply cannot stop doing them even though they know others may perceive them as odd, they said.</p>
<p>Similarly, autistics and non-autistics use quotes from movies and television to communicate something about a situation. When the meaning of a given instance of echolalia is not immediately obvious, that doesn&#8217;t mean there is no meaning, Jaswal and Akhtar said. Indeed, echolalia can represent a profound way of trying to connect with other people. In an account described in the paper, one autistic boy repeated, 'Chicken Little thought the sky was&#160;falling, but the sky is not falling,' when his mother was despondent over the death of a friend.</p>
<p>The assumption that autistic people&#8217;s unusual behaviors indicate diminished social motivation has had profound and often negative effects on the ways they are studied and treated, according to the authors. Akhtar and Jaswal challenge that assumption and call for the consideration of alternative explanations.&#160;</p>
<p>"Hearing from autistic people themselves upends much of the conventional thinking. We need to take what they say seriously," said Akhtar. "Many of them express a deep desire to interact with other people. We need to consider alternative explanations for unusual behaviors, and be open to the possibility that autistic individuals may express their social interest in idiosyncratic ways."</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Johnston (Ph.D. &#8216;17, film and digital media) laughs as he describes his friendship with Ben Schultz-Figueroa (Ph.D. &#8216;18, film and digital media) on a sunny afternoon during the last week of spring quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two men, who met as graduate students at UC Santa Cruz, are about to embark on a highly coincidental journey&#8212;they will both begin as assistant professors of film at Seattle University in the fall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes these friends&#8217; serendipitous development even more surprising is the fact that the chances of it happening are so slim. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex and Ben immediately clicked when they met six years ago during a prospective student mixer that the Film and Digital Media Department hosts each spring for newly admitted graduate students. Their approach to filmmaking and desire to produce work with political and theoretical import forged the friendship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, they&#8217;ve bonded over B-horror-movies and conversations about film theory. Ben has published gifs in Alex&#8217;s online journal, NOW! A Journal of Urgent Praxis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ben&#8217;s had a big impact on my interests. He taught me that science fiction can influence how you think about history,&#8221; Alex said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two bring that intellectual synergy to their teaching. One quarter, Ben was teaching a course on animal studies, a deep dive into how humans and animals are represented in film, and Alex was teaching a course on the filmmaker Werner Herzog. Ben&#8217;s class visited Alex&#8217;s to watch a screening of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grizzly Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Herzog documentary film about a man who lived with grizzly bears in Alaska. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m excited! We&#8217;re going to get to do so much more of that next year!&#8221; Alex said, laughing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many Ph.D. candidates seeking academic careers, when Ben and Alex entered the job market, neither knew where they would end up. Only a handful of tenure-track jobs and postdocs open up each year within a discipline; hundreds of people may apply for the same position. It&#8217;s not uncommon for Ph.D. recipients to go through a few different cycles of job applications before landing a spot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In this market you have to apply everywhere,&#8221; Ben explained. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the odds, Alex and Ben felt prepared the job market, for which they credit the Film and Digital Media Department, especially their advisors, Jonathan Kahana and Shelley Stamp (respectively). The department is one of the only film graduate programs in the nation that emphasizes both creating films and writing critically about them.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I saw jobs that required film theory and practice, my radar went off. I knew those would be a good fit,&#8221; said Ben. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are a lot of academic jobs that require theory and practice, but very few people can say they have a hybrid degree,&#8221; Alex added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The film department at Seattle University falls within the English department. In many of the courses, films are treated like books or poems as objects for literary interpretation. With the addition of Alex and Ben, the department will be building out the film major, to incorporate filmmaking and film theory. The department will also have wider scope of the types of films a scholar might study. Ben, for instance, studies film footage of animal research in labs, not your typical Hollywood film. His work concerns the pairing of lab animal research and film to create scientific knowledge. &#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are aware of the outstanding national reputation of the Film and Digital Media Department at UC Santa Cruz, especially for its quality work in producing scholars who work on social documentation in either the MFA or Ph.D. programs,&#8221; said Kirsten Thompson, a professor of film at Seattle University. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are excited for Johnston&#8217;s creative work on race and sports and masculinity as of particular interest to students interested in historical injustices,&#8221; Thompson continued. &#8220;Schultz-Figueroa&#8217;s work on science and animals on film, as well as the history of experimental non-theatrical film, will expand our curriculum in cutting-edge new directions.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben and Alex aren&#8217;t the only Film and Digital Media graduates who have landed academic jobs. Anita Chang (Ph.D. &#8216;16, film and digital media) has a tenure-track position at CSU East Bay, Elaine Gan (Ph.D. &#8216;16, film and digital media) has a three-year postdoc at New York University, and Ian Alan Paul (Ph.D. &#8216;16, film and digital media) completed his first year in a tenure-track position at Stony Brook University in New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some might find it daunting to begin a new job in a new city after years in Santa Cruz, Alex and Ben feel fortunate that they will have each other to depend on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea of having someone else there who I trust and who is also my friend, is very appealing,&#8221; said Alex. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4863b8a1807270175cb4ed6b3233eaab"><name>soares-memory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Thank Instagram and Snapchat for your fading memories</title><summary>Research by UC Santa Cruz doctoral student Julia Soares has found compelling evidence that the act of taking a photograph impairs people’s memories of the event.</summary><keywords>memory, psychology, photography, instagram, snapchat</keywords><start-date>1530082800000</start-date><display-name>Soares-Memory</display-name><path>/2018/06/soares-memory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/soares-memory</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1530222851078</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1530223481553</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Carolyn McMillan</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/soares-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/soares-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>soares-350.jpg</name><display-name>soares-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>60833</file-size><width>350</width><height>394</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Julia Soares</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/soares-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/soares-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>soares-80.jpg</name><display-name>soares-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>4038</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Julia Soares</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>"Whenever they used a camera, they were less likely to remember as well as when they just observed," said Julia Soares, a doctoral student in psychology.

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368117301687">Research</a> by UC Santa Cruz doctoral student Julia Soares has found compelling evidence that the act of taking a photograph impairs people&#8217;s memories of the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think that taking a photo will help them remember something better, but it&#8217;s actually quite the contrary,&#8221; said Soares.</p>
<p>In a<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://qz.com/1295131/research-shows-taking-photos-decreases-the-ability-to-remember-lived-experience/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">set of experiments</a>, she invited people to her lab for a virtual museum tour where they looked at paintings on computer screens, knowing they would be tested on what they saw.</p>
<p>She compared how well participants remembered the paintings following three scenarios: when they just looked at the images; when they looked and took pictures using a camera phone; and when they took pictures using Snapchat.</p>
<p>The picture-takers consistently scored worse &#8212; by as much as 20 percent &#8212;&#160;on multiple choice tests about what they had seen.</p>
<p>Soares thought that the result could be chalked up to the phenomenon known as &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160816085029.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cognitive off-loading</a>&#8221;: that is, not remembering as well because you know the camera is there to remember for you.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote col-width"></blockquote>
<p>Even people who took pictures using Snapchat &#8212; in which images last only 10 seconds &#8212; remembered less. People who were asked to take a picture and then delete the image, also did worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever they used a camera, they were less likely to remember as well as when they just observed,&#8221; Soares said.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s behind it? Soares has a few ideas: That by stepping out of the moment to take a picture, people become less focused on what&#8217;s in front of them, a phenomenon she termed &#8220;attentional disengagement.&#8221; Taking photos might also create a false sense that we know the subject better than we actually do &#8212; what she calls a &#8220;metacognitive illusion&#8221; &#8212;&#160;making us less likely to use the mental strategies that help us remember.</p>
<p>Ironically, most of the photo-takers were sure that taking pictures improved their recall, she said.</p>
<p>Her results have made her think twice about when, and how often, she takes pictures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying people shouldn&#8217;t ever take photographs, but they might want to be mindful about deciding when they do it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4cce72c0807270175cb4ed6bd6f0491d"><name>farm-ranking</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Farm ranked among top college farms</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Farm has been ranked among the top 15 college farms in the country by Best Value Schools.</summary><keywords>farm, CASFS, agroecology, organic, colleges, rankings</keywords><start-date>1530255600000</start-date><display-name>Farm-Ranking</display-name><path>/2018/06/farm-ranking</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/farm-ranking</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1530296954399</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1530298158524</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/farm-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/farm-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-400.jpg</name><display-name>farm-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>52229</file-size><width>400</width><height>299</height></image><image-alt>Aerial of UCSC Farm</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/06/images/farm-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/06/images/farm-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>farm-80.jpg</name><display-name>farm-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3950</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aerial of UCSC Farm</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Farm has been ranked among the <a href="https://www.bestvalueschools.org/top-15-college-farms-united-states/">top 15 college farms</a> in the country by Best Value Schools.</p>

Moira Nelson</image-alt><image-caption>Dency, Charlie &amp; Moira Nelson</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With an amazing career in Hollywood spanning nearly 40 years,&#160;<strong>Dency Nelson</strong>&#160;has been the stage manager for almost every major award and event show for the past 25 years, including the Oscars, Grammys, Emmys, and Kennedy Center Honors. On top of that, he also worked on the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 1996 and 2002 Olympics, and President Obama&#8217;s &#8220;We are the One&#8221; inaugural event&#8230;just to name a few. The list of his accomplishments is almost endless.</p>
<p>But after such an extensive and successful career, Nelson was ready to rest on his laurels and retired in 2013 from the hectic pace of show business. However, he has remained active with an issue that&#8217;s been close to his heart since high school &#8211; protecting the environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had the great privilege of working with absolutely every film, television, and music star, starting with my cue card job for Merv Griffin in 1976, until retiring from my DGA [Director&#8217;s Guild of America] stage manager career,&#8221; he says. Some of his favorite stars to work with included Carol Burnett, Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Wayne Brady, Julie Andrews, George Clooney, Michael Douglas, Garth Brooks, James Taylor, Tony Bennett, and Quincy Jones. &#8220;I could go on and on, but those are the few who deserve special mention!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nelson grew up in Palo Alto, CA and attended UC Santa Cruz where he graduated with a BA in Theater Arts with an emphasis in design, and was part of what was then College V, and now known as Porter College. And his daughter, Charlie, also attended UCSC starting back in 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 1970, when I graduated from high school, UCSC was the most exciting new campus in the country,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was attracting students from all over the country&#8230;and I was thrilled to have been accepted! It was the perfect place for me and seemed like destiny!&#8221;</p>
<h3>True love intervened</h3>
<p>After graduating, Nelson was planning on going on to graduate school to study theater design at either New York University, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, or Columbia, but true love intervened. Nelson&#8217;s would-be-future wife, Moira, and fellow UCSC graduate, was already pursuing her graduate degree in UCLA, and Nelson couldn&#8217;t imagine being without her.</p>
<p>He joined Moira in Los Angeles where they found a cozy apartment in Westwood, and then Nelson started looking for entry-level production jobs while also taking acting classes and auditioning. His big break came when he landed a job as the driver and mail clerk for the American Film Institute, which led to better and more important entertainment-industry opportunities, and eventually his career has Hollywood&#8217;s most renowned stage manager.</p>
<h3>A soft spot for Cameron Diaz...</h3>
<p>After stage-managing the Oscars for 25 years, Nelson has seen it all. He has fond memories of all of the famous actors he queued on the stage every year and then assisted as they exited with their Academy Awards. Always the ultimate professional, he only has&#160;<em>positive</em> comments to say about everyone he&#8217;s encountered, and claims to have a special soft spot for Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, and Salma Hayek.</p>
<p>When it came time to move on from the Oscars, he was ready. &#8220;I had a five-year plan to get to the retirement date,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was getting harder and harder to get up in the morning and wasn&#8217;t as much fun as it once was&#8230;production budgets were tighter and the folks in charge didn&#8217;t have real &#8216;show biz&#8217; in their blood like the masters I had started with almost 40 years before. I was also eager to spend more time with my political, environmental, and community activism."</p>
<p>A lifelong environmentalist, Nelson now has the time to devote to environmental causes &#8211; a passion that began when he was in high school and organized events for the very first Earth Day on April 21, 1970. He also was the first Hermosa Beach resident to put photovoltaic solar on his roof back in 1999, purchased his first electric car in 2002, and is a founding member of Plug In America.</p>
<p>Current events in the U.S. surrounding climate change issues have him extremely concerned, but he takes solace in living in California. &#8220;We have led the way on all important issues, certainly first and foremost, the environment,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The world would not have electric cars if it weren&#8217;t for the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate that was law in California first.&#8221;</p>
<h3>"Elon Musk saved the EV"</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://pluginamerica.org/">Plug In America</a></strong>&#160;evolved from the Save EV1 campaign that was depicted in the acclaimed documentary&#160;<a href="http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/"><strong>&#8220;Who Killed the Electric Car?&#8221;</strong></a>&#160;that revealed how General Motors was destroying perfectly driveable electric cars, thinking selling them would lower profits. Toyota was getting set to do the same thing to their RAV4EV, but stopped after intense public pressure. &#8220;That success, in the summer of 2005, told us we could make a difference,&#8221; says Nelson.</p>
<p>He has high hopes for the electric car once again emerging and becoming more universal, especially with the rise of Tesla Motors. &#8220;Elon Musk saved the EV. He took it out of the golf cart realm and demonstrated that only the EV can achieve the sexy, fast, free-to-fuel, and soon affordable, convenient cars that we all can and should be driving,&#8221; he says. Nelson charges his own electric cars, at no cost, via the PV solar array on his home&#8217;s roof.</p>
<p>But, he&#8217;s still apprehensive about the future of the health of our planet and worries that programs supporting the environment and the electric car could end. &#8220;The current administration is threatening these programs and removing the still much-needed incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles. We are at very critical cusp here.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Nelson continues with his heart-felt activism, he&#8217;s enjoying his retirement after having had such a remarkable career, and looks forward to continuing to do what he can to combat climate change. &#8220;I&#8217;m counting on us here in California and I will be there to help us! We need to stay the course and increase our goals to achieve carbon neutrality in this state&#8230;it&#8217;s even more important now!&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="7051db0980727017273daba42450daed"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1527840000000</start-date><path>/2018/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/06/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1513712900857</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1513887798115</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
