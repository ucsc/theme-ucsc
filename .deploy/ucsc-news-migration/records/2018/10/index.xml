Ph.D. pathways at 24 campuses</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is part of a consortium of nine UC and 15 California State University campuses collectively awarded a five-year, $5 million grant from the National Science Foundation to dramatically increase diversity in physics and astronomy through the Cal-Bridge program.</p>
<p>Launched four years ago in Southern California, the Cal-Bridge program creates a pathway for students from multiple CSU campuses to Ph.D. programs in physics and astronomy at UC campuses across California. Last year, the program began a small-scale expansion into Northern California, with UC Santa Cruz and San Jose State University leading the effort.</p>
<p>"This new grant allows us to ramp up the program substantially," said Bruce Schumm, professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, who leads the the Northern California Cal-Bridge program along with principal investigator Aaron Romanowsky, an astronomer at San Jose State University.</p>
<p>"This program knits together the three branches of the California higher education system by identifying promising physics and astronomy students within the broadly diverse CSU and community college systems and connecting them to a strong mentoring and professional development network," Schumm said.</p>
<p>Currently, students from underrepresented minority groups represent 30 percent of the U.S. population but less than 4 percent of physics and astronomy Ph.D.s awarded nationwide. The Cal-Bridge program aims to have a national impact on the number of students from underrepresented groups graduating with a physics degree and matriculating to Ph.D. programs in physics or astronomy.</p>
<p>The new grant allows Cal-Bridge to expand from about a dozen scholars per year to as many as 50 statewide. The national average of underrepresented minorities earning a Ph.D. in these fields is about 80 per year. Cal-Bridge is led by principal investigator and program director Alexander Rudolph, a Cal Poly Pomona professor of physics and astronomy.</p>
<p>Cal-Bridge scholars are recruited from the 15 CSU campuses and more than 30 community colleges in the Cal-Bridge network, with the help of local faculty and staff liaisons at each campus. Once selected, Cal-Bridge Scholars receive substantial financial support, intensive mentoring, professional development workshops, and exposure to a wide variety of research opportunities.</p>
<p>"We're trying to identify students who are 'diamonds in the rough,' who show potential but might not stand out by the usual academic indicators," Schumm said. "The goal is to get these students into graduate school and ultimately to bring more diversity into the ranks of physicists and astronomers in California and nationwide. Our new cohort was just here for a program on campus, and they are a diverse group of very impressive students."</p>
<p>Every student has two faculty mentors, one at a CSU and one at a UC. A steering committee of CSU and UC faculty convenes several times a year to discuss each student in depth, providing important group feedback into the mentoring process.</p>
<p>"We lay out the path for them to get into graduate school, offer workshops for professional development and computing skills, and provide connections to summer research internships," Schumm said.</p>
<p>The program has been highly successful in its first five years in developing a pipeline of highly diverse, qualified scholars, many of whom have already successfully matriculated to a Ph.D. program in physics or astronomy. The program just selected its fifth cohort of 27 scholars from 10 different CSU campuses across the state, bringing the total number of scholars to 61 in five cohorts, including 35 Latinos, seven African-Americans, and 27 women (16 of the 27 women are from underrepresented minority groups). In the last three years, 19 of 21 Cal-Bridge Scholars who have earned their bachelor&#8217;s degree in physics have begun or will attend Ph.D. programs in physics or astronomy at top programs nationally, including UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, Harvard University, Northwestern University, the University of Maryland, Michigan State University, and Penn State University.</p>
<p>Schumm said he hopes the Cal-Bridge program can serve as a model for programs to address diversity issues in other STEM fields and in other states.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.cpp.edu/~sci/physics-astronomy/research/cal-bridge.shtml</url><title>Cal-Bridge

Thirteen UC Santa Cruz undergraduates led by Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, traveled 2,800 miles through Alaska and the Yukon territory this summer, doing field work at research sites and studying the effects of climate change in the far north.</p>
<p>"Hands down the best experience I've had to date," said Molly Cassatt-Johnstone. "We'd been learning about all these things in the classroom, and then we actually got to go and see how climate change is affecting the land and people in the Arctic."</p>
<p>"It's one thing to read about climate change and how the ice is melting in the Arctic, but it's another thing to go out and see it," said Christopher Garrison. "You see how real it is when the roads are buckling and full of cracks and dips because the permafrost is melting under the road."</p>
<p>Offered for the first time this year, Shapiro's course on Arctic Ecology and Environmental Change started in the classroom in spring 2018. The course covered the region's ecology, geology, geography, ice ages, animal migrations, human history, science communication, and more. Two teaching assistants and a course assistant helped with teaching and logistics, and a series of guest lecturers shared their expertise in various subjects. Each student investigated a specific topic related to environmental change in the Arctic and wrote and produced a podcast on it.</p>
<p>In June, they gathered in Whitehorse, the capital of Canada's Yukon territory, to start the field component. The three-week camping and road trip took the class to remote research stations, gold mining sites where the bones of woolly mammoths and other ice age animals are being uncovered, the historic mining town of Dawson City, and up the Yukon's famed Dempster Highway all the way to the Arctic Ocean. Along the way, the students prepared for their final project, a public debate at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Center back in Whitehorse on the topic of whether climate change is locally a net benefit for people living in the Yukon.</p>
<p>"This was an opportunity for the students to synthesize everything they've learned in different classes as undergraduates, and bring it all together to develop compelling arguments with real-world implications," Shapiro said. "This experience will have a long-lasting impact on the students, to have seen this part of the world that is changing so rapidly from climate change."</p>
<p>The students talked to local people all along the way, including people living in a First Nation community who are facing the challenge of moving their settlement because of sea level rise.</p>
<p>"The only positive anyone mentioned was longer growing seasons for agriculture," said Garrison, who graduated this summer with a B.S. in ecology and evolutionary biology. "Sea level rise and melting permafrost is threatening their infrastructure, long-term prospects aren't good for the salmon and caribou that native people depend on, the seasonality is changing, and it's drier, with precipitation more concentrated in heavy downpours. Everywhere we saw how climate change is affecting people."</p>
<p>Students had been assigned to take one side or the other in the debate on the pros and cons of climate change, which was held before an audience of 65 people in Whitehorse. Although the pro side came out on top, emphasizing the advantages of a longer growing season and milder climate, they acknowledged that there were stronger arguments on the con side.</p>
<p>"We did win, not on substance but on style. They had science on their side, and we had debate technicalities," said Cassatt-Johnstone, who graduated in August with a B.S. in biology and cognitive science.</p>
<p>Shelby Dunn, another student on the pro side, said, "We knew we had the harder argument and we were ready to fight. I think the other side was caught by surprise."</p>
<p>Dunn, a senior majoring in ecology and evolutionary biology, said a highlight of the trip was the gold mining site near Dawson City where Shapiro's research team has been collecting and studying the remains of ancient horses, woolly mammoths, and other Pleistocene megafauna preserved in the permafrost. "You could see in the hillside all the different geological ages in cross section, and just the idea that we were seeing bones from the Pleistocene was pretty awesome," she said.</p>
<p>The effects of melting permafrost also made a big impression on Dunn. In Dawson City, she saw buildings and infrastructure breaking apart as the ground becomes uneven. The class witnessed an even more dramatic effect of warming temperatures at a "megaslump," where thawing permafrost has caused a deep, expanding sinkhole to open up in the tundra. Several students mentioned the megaslump as a highlight of the trip, despite the phenomenal cloud of mosquitoes that enveloped them at the site.</p>
<p>"That was what we like to call type B fun&#8212;not fun in the moment, but fun looking back on it," said Cassatt-Johnstone.</p>
<p>There was also plenty of what might be called type A fun, including wildlife sightings (grizzlies, moose, etc.), stunning landscapes, and a new adventure every day. Garrison, a birder, was thrilled to finally see a great gray owl. "It was a very powerful and unique educational experience. Most people don't ever take a field course, but it's an incredible way to learn," he said.</p>
<p>One of the things students discovered on the trip was how rewarding it can be to persevere and endure some discomfort and adversity in the pursuit of a goal. The megaslump hike exemplified this for Anthony Aceves.</p>
<p>"It was a long, excruciating hike across the tundra, we were eaten alive by mosquitoes, got stuck in the mud, and at the end of the day it was one of the best things I ever got to do. We saw so many cool things," he said. "The lowest point of the trip was leaving on the last day. I just didn't want to leave."</p>
<p>Aceves, who graduated this summer with a B.S. in ecology and evolutionary biology and is now pursuing a master's degree in education, said he is drawing from his experiences over the summer in his student teaching at a middle school in San Jose.</p>
<p>"I'm teaching them about climate change and fossils, and being able to talk about my own experiences makes it more meaningful for the students," he said.

The film documents activities ranging from the local rent freeze campaign (from signature gathering to the city council vote), to high-end real estate tours, to housing lawyers on the job. It also covers topics such as Santa Cruz&#8217;s growing homeless tent encampment, new construction, and tiny home dwellers. <br/><br/>"My students are really excited about getting to show at the festival,&#8221; said Lusztig. &#8220;It&#8217;s their first time at a film festival for most of them, and it&#8217;s such an important issue right now."<br/><br/>"I have done this kind of group project a number of times before, but I think this time, in particular, all of the students felt like stakeholders and were really invested in the topic, because housing in this area affects every single one of them," she added. "Most of them personally knew friends who live in cars, tents, garages, pool sheds, or on couches." <br/><br/>The film notes that Santa Cruz County is currently the fourth least affordable housing market in the world, with home values rising 8.6% in the past year and on track to reach an average price of $892,000 by January of 2019. <br/><br/>"It was difficult to find subjects who were willing and able to talk about their housing situations, since a lot of people are living in spaces that they're not necessarily supposed to be in," observed senior film and digital major Tessa Jagger-Wells. "We had to work very hard to make sure people felt like we were on their side, and that we would protect their identity."<br/><br/>"It's also just a very sensitive topic in general, and most people feel strongly about different issues. It was a challenge to represent different perspectives and create a relatively unbiased film, but we certainly tried to talk to different kinds of people and tell the most complete story possible." <br/><br/>"I learned a lot about Santa Cruz itself," she added. "It's an incredible city with a complex history that has led us to where we are today. A lot of the complications that have resulted in the housing crisis come from the fact that Santa Cruz has so much to offer. Some people try to take advantage of that, but I think a lot of people really appreciate it and are trying to protect it."<br/><br/>Lusztig noted that the class offered students a rare opportunity to work together on a large project. Every aspect of the film was produced collectively, from research to shooting to editing. In the process, the students not only learned a great deal about filmmaking, but also about how to collaborate and negotiate with others, as well as how to be accountable for their own work in a group. <br/><br/>"The most important thing I've learned from this experience would have to be building a strong relationship with the group I'm filming with," said senior film and digital media student Kelly Leonardson. "Some of us handled the cameras better, others knew how to talk and plan out shoots better. We were able to help each other learn more about filmmaking along the way. I'm pretty sure I've made lifelong friends from taking this class."<br/><br/>"Overall, I still can't believe we were able to make a feature film in 10 weeks," she added. "This class has definitely given me hope for the future."<br/><br/>&#160;Jagger-Wells added that she was surprised by how easy it was to collaborate with her classmates. <br/><br/>"A lot of it was due to the flawless guidance of our professor. Irene was able to provide us with the tools we needed to create the film, while keeping enough distance to let us make our own creation. We also had a really great group of people, with a great work ethic and a variety of skills. I learned a lot about working in a group, especially a large group. It can be difficult when everyone has a different vision for the final product, but we were able to create a cohesive film that represented the work we all put in."</p>
<p>The film was directed by UC Santa Cruz students Jazmine Corona; Joshua Cosbey; Andrea Diaz; Bianca Galeana; Jiaxun Gao; Carlos Gonzalez; Alexis Guzman; Michelle Hua; Tess Jagger-Wells; Noel Kabe; Enrique Labrada; Kelly Leonardson; Kathy Liang; Juliette Perrault; Bojun Qiu; Collette Quach; Tatianna Stapleton; James Tanjuatco; and Hui Zhang.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="31647895807270170d8867fa4d3ca10b"><name>move-in-2018</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Voices from move-in 2018</title><summary>Nervous new students arrived with their parents to settle in to their new campus housing during move-in, about a week before the start of the fall quarter.

<p>California's Central Valley is plagued by poverty, unemployment, pollution, and high rates of youth incarceration. For most kids who grow up there, the goal is to get out. But this summer, 25 UC Santa Cruz and UC Merced students turned that narrative on its head and returned home, eager to give back to their communities.</p>
<p>Through the nonpartisan Central Valley Freedom Summer project, students spent three months empowering youth. They interned with community organizations and reached out to high school students to register young voters and teach them about civic engagement. They hosted youth summits, conferences, and workshops about grassroots organizing. They sponsored art events and mural paintings, all with an eye toward beautifying their hometowns and energizing underserved residents.</p>
<p>Modeled after Freedom Summer, the Mississippi voter-registration drive that began in 1964, Central Valley Freedom Summer was the brainchild of Veronica Terriquez, an associate professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz whose research focuses on youth civic engagement. In the 1960s, young university students from all over the country, but particularly the Northeast, flocked to the South to support the Civil Rights Movement. But many of the students were outsiders, and they didn't have deep ties to the community. When they left, they took their energy and talent with them. Terriquez wanted to support a different movement in the Central Valley, one that would build on the undergraduates' deep ties to their hometowns.</p>
<p>"In the South in the early '60s, black voters were terrorized and intimidated. Voter suppression was deliberate and effective," said Terriquez. "In the Central Valley, part of the challenge is a lot of youth are the children of first-generation immigrants who don't have the right to vote. One of the strongest predictors of youth voting is whether their parents vote. We wanted to do peer-to-peer education to help build a culture that encourages young people to vote."</p>
<p>Central Valley Freedom Summer focused on registering young voters, who have one of the lowest turnout rates: just 16 percent of Californians aged 18-24 voted in the June 5 primary.</p>
<p>"Schools rarely orient students to the voting process," said Terriquez. "Compared to places like Los Angeles and the Bay Area, educators in the Central Valley seem particularly reluctant to talk about elections and contentious issues that affect the community."</p>
<p>Terriquez's research shows that voter education and civic engagement make a big difference in voter turnout, so the UCSC undergraduates, joined by six students from UC Merced, reached out to Central Valley youth in their schools and community centers. They talked about issues that resonate with youth: jobs, immigration, Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ rights, criminal justice reform, and environmental justice issues. They explained that every vote matters, bringing home the message with examples like the 10-year sales tax extension in the rural Central Valley town of Delano that passed in 2016&#8212;by just 66 votes.</p>
<p><strong>"It all gets back to the vote"</strong></p>
<p>Jose Orellana is one of the UCSC undergraduates who went home to the Central Valley to register and energize voters.</p>
<p>Orellana interned with the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment in his hometown of Delano, one of the more liberal cities in the valley, best known as the birthplace of the United Farm Workers. Still, Orellana noted, turnout among young voters is in the single digits.</p>
<p>"It all gets back to the vote," said Orellana. "All the problems&#8212;poverty, low education, the oil industry, unpaved streets, horrible air quality&#8212;it all goes back to the vote, because people aren't showing up. It's not that they don't care, it's that no one's educating them on these issues."</p>
<p>Orellana and his UC Merced counterpart Lidia Gonzalez found it difficult to get into schools--which are on a year-round schedule--to talk about voter rights and to register, and preregister, voters.</p>
<p>"People in Kern County, there's a lot of resistance," he said. "They're scared of our work, even though we're nonpartisan."</p>
<p>So Orellana set about breaking down barriers, taking the lead on drafting a resolution for the Delano Joint Union High School Board called "Empowering and Preparing Young Voters." The resolution mandates that schools support voter-education efforts like Central Valley Freedom Summer's by allowing voting advocates onto campus, providing space and materials, and involving youth in Young Voter Committees. Board members unanimously approved the measure in early September.</p>
<p>Orellana said it has been "amazing" to support Delano youth, who formed their own new youth organization, LOUD for Tomorrow, and advocated for the resolution as their first policy initiative. "I'm so proud," he said. "We're really growing and doing good work. Our students are so engaged and motivated for social change."</p>
<p>The summer has changed Orellana's life, too.</p>

<p><strong>Building a collective voice</strong></p>
<p>Like a lot of Central Valley kids, Orellana is the son of immigrants and the first in his family to go to college. He arrived at UCSC planning to major in business or a STEM subject.</p>
<p>"It was unexpected for me to do this kind of work. I didn't go to marches or do community work or care about the environment," he said. "People say college changes people, and college changed me. I just started participating."</p>
<p>Taking a class from Terriquez&#8212;"Doctor T," as some of her students call her&#8212;opened his eyes to how social change happens. "She was always telling us, 'Youth led the change,'" said Orellana, who is majoring in critical race and ethnic studies.</p>
<p>This summer, Orellana learned to run meetings, speak to community leaders and elected officials, and knock on countless doors. "The hardest thing is getting rejection, when people don't want to talk with you," he said. "But there was nothing like this here before." Now, LOUD for Tomorrow has individual chapters in three high schools.</p>
<p>A highlight of the summer was when legendary activist Dolores Huerta made an unannounced appearance at a youth conference in Delano that Orellana organized. "It was such a surprise," said Orellana, who was at the podium when Huerta walked in. "I was so proud that she came to my conference."</p>
<p>With two more years of college ahead of him, Orellana now sees a different future after graduation. He plans to return to the Central Valley and carry on the work he began this summer. "For me, this is not a short-term investment," he said. "I'm looking forward to getting grants and donors to continue this work and build our collective voice, our collective power. I have to come back for my community if I want it to change. We're in this for the long run."</p>
<p><strong>Brain drain</strong></p>
<p>California is home to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, great surfing, and towering redwoods. But like the Golden Gate Bridge, most of the Golden State's most famous icons are coastal. Inland, the landscape is dominated by agriculture and oil rigs.</p>
<p>From Stockton to Bakersfield, job opportunities are limited, public transportation is lacking, and graduates of K-12 schools say they don't do enough to prepare students for college. Levels of extreme poverty are high, and unemployment in poor neighborhoods approaches 20 percent; teen pregnancy rates are among the highest in the country; and agricultural chemicals have polluted much of the valley's groundwater, rendering the water undrinkable and sometimes hazardous even for bathing.</p>
<p>All of this is contributing to what demographers call a "brain drain," as residents flee the Central Valley in pursuit of higher education and more opportunity. Which makes Orellana's determination to return to Delano significant. And he's not alone.</p>
<p>Randy Villegas, a graduate student in politics at UCSC who supervised undergraduate participants in Central Valley Freedom Summer, was raised in Bakersfield. His own research focuses on identifying the best strategies to engage low-income youth and youth of color in community organizing and civic action, and he plans to write his dissertation about the Central Valley. Villegas watched young college students emerge as effective community leaders and as mentors to high school students. "It's very rare for them to see someone who looks like them who is at the UC level," Villegas said of the high school students. "This summer has inspired the kind of research I want to do, about communities that are often ignored."</p>
<p>Many of the undergraduates have been transformed, he noted. They've gained skills in organizing, advocacy, media relations, and social science research. Each participant has taken detailed field notes on their experience to contribute to Terriquez's research.</p>
<p>"I've seen a lot of growth," said Villegas. "It's been amazing to see how adaptable and resourceful they are, and how supportive they are of each other and the community they've built. They are inspiring these young students to make a difference."</p>
<p>Students who thought they would never come back to the Central Valley "now have a different idea," said Villegas, who aspires to teach political science at Cal State Bakersfield&#8212;"or hopefully at UC Bakersfield."</p>
<p>Roxanna Villalobos, who earned her B.A. in psychology and feminist studies from UCSC in 2012, returned to the campus as a doctoral student in sociology because she wanted to do community-based research in the Central Valley. Meeting Terriquez and joining the Central Valley Freedom Summer project was "a dream come true," she said.</p>
<p>Villalobos grew up in the small town of Parlier outside of Fresno, raised by a single mother who worked in a produce packing house. After college, she earned a master's in gender and cultural studies and spent two years as a social worker in Boston. Coming home, she was struck by how little had changed. "The situation in the Central Valley isn't getting better for farm workers, in terms of pesticide exposure, arthritis, and asthma," she said. "I started to think that instead of running away from it, maybe I should come back and change the way things are."</p>
<p>With support from private foundations, Central Valley Freedom Summer was able to provide a $4,000 stipend to undergraduate participants as compensation for their grassroots organizing and their internships. Community-based organizations are working on initiatives such as immigrant rights, pesticide reform, environmental justice and racism, reproductive justice, and access to clean water. Villalobos supervised 15 interns working in Visalia, Merced, Modesto, and Fresno.</p>
<p>"Higher education wasn't widely available to the people I grew up with," said Villalobos, one of fewer than 10 students in her high school class of 200 who enrolled in a four-year college. "I saw doing well in high school as my ticket to getting out. I was told to take the SATs. Not everybody was. I was lucky to be given opportunities."</p>
<p>Building the pipeline to higher education is part of the Central Valley Freedom Summer strategy. As part of a two-quarter course last year, UCSC undergraduates gained research and community-organizing skills. Over spring break, they returned to their hometowns to reach out to high school students and begin building the network they would engage with over the summer. A summer kickoff youth leadership summit at UC Merced, "Central Valley Rising," attracted over 100 young people. Seven smaller local conferences rolled out during the summer, each led by UC students in collaboration with high school partners.</p>
<p>"This movement is being led by young people, for young people," said Villalobos. "Most of them had never been civically engaged. They had never seen it as cool. But Central Valley Freedom Summer offers community and support. It emphasizes the importance of getting civically engaged."</p>
<p>Villalobos and Villegas will join Terriquez in analyzing the effectiveness of Central Valley Freedom Summer, including documenting barriers the students encountered and strategies they used to overcome them.</p>
<p>"I've been really touched by how much the students learned," said Villalobos. "They see themselves continuing this work. They see the work that needs to be done, and they're capable leaders now. They are qualified to do something about it. They didn't see these opportunities before."</p>
<p>Villalobos, whose research focuses on gender-based youth organizing, looks forward to being a professor and a role model for youth. "We don't have a lot of Latina professors from the Central Valley in the Central Valley," she said.</p>

<p><strong>Tomorrow's leaders</strong></p>
<p>UCSC undergraduate Rosanai Paniagua grew up in the small town of Richgrove, about 30 miles north of Bakersfield. She has been in on the Central Valley Freedom Summer since its inception. As a research assistant for Terriquez last summer, she remembers her professor asking what she thought about the idea. "I told her it sounded amazing," recalled Paniagua, who is majoring in sociology and Latin American and Latino studies. "We didn't have things like this."</p>
<p>Paniagua helped organize the youth conference in Porterville, which attracted 40 people, including about 20 high school students. A more conservative town than Delano, Porterville was a challenging place to do outreach. "It was hard to get people to come out," she said.</p>
<p>But the establishment of LOUD for Tomorrow more than made up for any disappointment she felt about her ability to draw big crowds. "The youth are so involved, and they've grown so much," she said. "They didn't know how involved you can be. They have found their voice."</p>
<p>Paniagua knows a bit about finding one's voice. Her parents both worked in the fields for 30 years; her father drives a semi now. Paniagua, who has four older brothers, said the odds were stacked against all of them. "I don't know how we didn't fall into gangs or, for me, become a teen mother," she said. "I credit my mom. She made sure we weren't going to work in the fields. She wanted us to go to college." And they all did.</p>
<p>Looking back on her education, Paniagua says, "Our schools aren't the best. Teachers just pass out worksheets. Two math teachers were just fired for incompetence. Our students deserve much more."</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, perhaps it's no surprise that voter turnout is so low. Among Delano residents ages 18-24 years old, the numbers are telling. "Of 7,600 young people, only 1,800 are registered&#8212;and only half of those turned out to vote in 2016," said Paniagua.</p>
<p>Paniagua feels strong ties to the Central Valley. "Even in high school, I thought I wanted to come back," she said. "I was made by my community. It made me who I am. My community deserves my return. I want to give back."</p>

<p><em>"Young people shared powerful testimony about how our work opened their eyes to policies that impact their community," said Veronica Terriquez, associate professor of sociology, who organized Central Valley Freedom Summer. (Photo by Valerie Gorospe)&#160;</em></p>
<p><strong>Building excitement&#8212;and a model for the future</strong></p>
<p>As Terriquez tallied up impacts at the end of the summer&#8212;including more than 3,000 voters registered or preregistered&#8212;she expressed satisfaction with the effort. The summer produced ripple effects, large and small, that will be felt for years.</p>
<p>"We know our effort was small, but it's a start," said Terriquez. "We want to understand what works so others can scale up this effort in the Central Valley and other places." After she and her research team analyze the results of Central Valley Freedom Summer, she anticipates publishing academic journal articles and taking their findings "on the road" to community-based organizations and philanthropists who support youth civic engagement.</p>
<p>"We wanted to generate excitement around the election, particularly in areas where youth are not exposed to the importance of voting in their schools or their families," she said. "We got mixed results. It took some people by surprise, and some students were not welcome to do voter registration and education. People were a little skeptical."</p>
<p>But Terriquez witnessed "real enthusiasm and an awakening" among young valley residents who attended youth conferences, summits, and workshops, or whose schools allowed Terriquez's team to share their message about the importance of exercising the right to vote.</p>
<p>"Particularly in small and rural towns, many young people are not used to talking about voting as one way to help tackle local concerns," she said. "There's some reluctance to engage. But in the end, young people shared powerful testimony about how our work opened their eyes to policies that impact their community, how they came to imagine a better future for their community, and how excited they are about voting for the first time. They appreciated what we were doing."</p>

In compliance with a federal law known as the Jeanne Clery Act, the <a href="https://police.ucsc.edu/crime-prevention/fire-clery-2017.pdf">Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report for 2017</a> (PDF) is online and also included as an attachment. More information can be found <a href="https://police.ucsc.edu/crime-prevention/clery.html">online</a>.</p>
<p>The Clery Act&#8212;named by Congress in honor of 19-year-old Jeanne Clery, a Lehigh University student who was raped and killed in her dorm room&#8212;requires colleges and universities to disclose their security policies, keep a public crime log, publish an annual crime report, and provide timely warnings to students and campus employees about a crime posing an immediate or ongoing threat to students and campus employees.</p>
<p>The report contains information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, university police law enforcement authority, crime reporting policies, disciplinary procedures, and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus. It also contains information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by UC Santa Cruz; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.</p>
<p>In addition to the report cited above, federal and state laws require the campus to annually share information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>obtaining information about registered sex offenders;</li>
<li>getting help with drug and alcohol dependency;</li>
<li>the campus nondiscrimination policy;</li>
<li>California's mandatory reporting laws; and</li>

<h3>Information about registered sex offenders</h3>
<p>Pursuant to the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, institutions of higher education must annually provide the campus community with how law enforcement agency information concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained.</p>
<p>The State of California requires sex offenders to register with the police department in the jurisdiction in which they reside. The state makes this information available to law enforcement agencies. This information is available to the public at the local police/sheriff's department. For the UC Santa Cruz campus, information on registered sex offenders is available at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office, 701 Ocean St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060, 831-454-2242.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Federal Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act provides for the tracking of convicted sex offenders enrolled at or employed at institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>California Penal Code &#167;290.01 requires sex offenders who are enrolled as a student, or is, with or without compensation, a full-time or part-time employee, or is carrying on a vocation for more than 14 days, or for an aggregate period exceeding 30 days in a calendar year to register with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of commencing enrollment or employment. The terms "employed or carries on a vocation" include employment whether or not financially compensated, volunteered, or performed for government or educational benefit. The registrant shall also notify the UC Santa Cruz Police Department within five working days of ceasing to be enrolled or employed, or ceasing to carry on a vocation.</p>
<p>Information on these registered sex offenders is available to the public at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department. Access to the data is by appointment only. Information on registered sex offenders is also available on the <a href="http://meganslaw.ca.gov/">Megan's Law website</a>.</p>
<p>More information about the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, the Clery Act or sex offender information can be found at <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu/">police.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<h3>Help with drug, alcohol dependency</h3>
<p>Drug and alcohol dependency are treatable conditions.</p>
<p>For employees, the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a> (EAP) is one resource available to assist those with dependency problems.</p>
<p>For students, the <a href="https://shop.ucsc.edu/">Student Health Outreach and Promotion</a> (SHOP) program offers information, education, resources and support on issues, including alcohol and other drug use, sexually transmitted infections and sexual health, and college life balance.</p>
<p>All members of the campus community who feel that they may have a substance dependence should consider seeking help from one of these resources or the many community programs available locally.</p>
<p>To assist in efforts to achieve a campus free from the problems of substance abuse, UC Santa Cruz has adopted policies prohibiting the unlawful manufacture, sale, distribution, possession, or use of controlled substances and alcohol. Any member of the campus community who violates these policies will be subject to disciplinary action and possible criminal sanctions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/talent-acquisition/annual-notice-substance-abuse-ltr.pdf">UC Policy on Substance Abuse</a> describes UCSC policy related to substance abuse, and your responsibilities in complying with and enforcing them. It also provides practical advice on how to help a colleague or yourself.</p>

</ul>
<h3>California mandatory reporting laws</h3>
<p>As outlined by Penal Code &#167;368 and Welfare and Institutions Code &#167;15600 et al., the California Legislature enacted recent laws to require elderly and dependent adult care custodians, health practitioners, Adult Protective Services staff, law enforcement, and other designated agencies to report and to investigate incidents of abuse/neglect. The categories of abuse and neglect that must be reported by mandated parties now include: physical, sexual, financial, isolation, abandonment, abduction, neglect, mental suffering, and self-neglect.</p>
<p>California Penal Code &#167;11160 requires prompt, mandatory reporting to the local law enforcement agency by healthcare practitioners (such as those at the Cowell Student Health Center) when they provide medical services to a person they know or reasonably suspect is suffering from wounds inflicted by a firearm or as a result of assaultive or abusive conduct.</p>
<p>The Child Abuse Neglect and Reporting Act (CANRA), codified in California Penal Code &#167;&#167;11164-11174.3, requires that employers of mandated reporters (as defined in the Act) promote identification and reporting of child abuse or neglect. It is the policy of the University of California to comply with its obligations under the Act; to require that all university employees and administrators who are mandated reporters make required reports to child protection or law enforcement agencies; and, more broadly, to encourage all members of the university community who observe, have actual knowledge of, or reasonably suspect child abuse or neglect at a university facility or perpetrated by university personnel to promptly report the concern to appropriate law enforcement, external officials and university officials. More information about the University of California CANRA Policy can be found at: <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000603/CANRA">policy.ucop.edu/doc/4000603/CANRA</a>.</p>
<h3>Student Safety Bill (AB 1433)</h3>
<p>Pursuant to California Education Code &#160;&#167;&#167;67380(a)(6)(A), 67381 and 67383(a), the UC Santa Cruz Police Department must report immediately or as soon as practicably possible to the appropriate local law enforcement agency, all reports received by a campus security authority (CSA) of any Part 1 violent crime, sexual assault, or hate crime, committed on or off campus. This includes reports victims make directly to CSAs as well as reports victims make to other University employees that are then conveyed to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department or other CSAs.</p>
<p>Such reports will include, when the victim has consented to being identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name and characteristics of the victim;</li>
<li>The name and characteristics of the perpetrator if known;</li>
<li>Description of the incident, including location and date and time; and</li>
<li>Any report number assigned to the police incident report documenting the investigation being conducted by the jurisdictional agency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fire safety</h3>
<p>The deadly wildfires throughout California serve as a reminder that we all need to do our part to prevent wildfires. Anyone who smells smoke or sees a fire must not hesitate to dial 911.</p>
<p>Section 4421 of the Public Resources Code states that no person shall set fire or cause fire to be set to any forest, brush, or other flammable material which is on any land that is not his/her own, or under his/her legal control, without the permission of the owner, lessee, or agent of the owner or lessee of the land.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, Chief of Police, UC Santa Cruz Police Department</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3aca3035807270170d8867fad73eea8d"><name>mckay-home</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Housing crisis impacting city and county employees, survey reveals</title><summary>Those who work for and serve the city and county of Santa Cruz are being impacted by the housing crisis, according to researchers who surveyed nearly 500 people.</summary><keywords>home, housing, mckay, county, santa cruz</keywords><start-date>1538550000000</start-date><display-name>McKay-Home</display-name><path>/2018/10/mckay-home</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/mckay-home</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1538584619663</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1539277743123</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/mckay-home_450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/mckay-home_450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mckay-home_450.jpg</name><display-name>mckay-home_450.jpg</display-name><file-size>63654</file-size><width>450</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Tannery Arts Center residents</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/steve-miriam-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/steve-miriam-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>steve-miriam-80.jpg</name><display-name>steve-miriam-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8551</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Miriam Greenberg and Steve McKay</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>The Tannery Arts Center is a model of successful affordable housing policy, says Steve McKay.

<p>The results of the study, "<a href="http://noplacelikehome.ucsc.edu/en/">No Place Like Home</a>," will be presented on Thursday, October 18, as part of "No Place Like Home: Building Local Housing Solutions for All," a <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/no_place_like_home_building_local_housing_solutions_for_all#.W7J-GZNKhyA">free community-wide conversation</a> that begins at 7 p.m. in the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. The event will focus on policy proposals, including rent control and just-cause eviction, and feature a panel discussion with local and regional housing experts. Spanish translation will be available and refreshments will be provided.</p>
<p>"We want to share the findings from our latest study, which looks at the experiences of both renters and homeowners who directly serve our community," said Steve McKay, associate professor of sociology, who co-leads No Place Like Home with Sociology Professor Miriam Greenberg. Previous surveys documented the impact on <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/mckay-housing.html">renters</a> and the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/housing-research.html">unequal burdens</a> experienced by county residents.</p>
<p>In this installment, McKay and Greenberg collaborated with Service Employee International Union Local 521, whose members include city and county employees, as well as employees of two of the county's largest nonprofits: Community Bridges and Salud Para la Gente. "We talked to a cross section of the people who make Santa Cruz run&#8212;from bus drivers and social workers to dental assistants and rangers," said McKay. In addition to nearly 500 surveys, they conducted 30 in-depth interviews in an attempt to document impacts as well as opinions regarding a range of proposed policy solutions.</p>
<p>Survey results provide a snapshot of burdens faced by local families, including financial hardships, involuntary moves, and the impacts of housing displacement on commute times, housing security, and children's schooling, said McKay. Among the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>46 percent of those surveyed said they experienced difficulties paying rent or mortgage in the last five years, and half of those said they had to forgo buying food or essential medicines in order to make their housing payment.</li>
<li>About 60 percent of those surveyed said they had difficulty finding housing, and 95 percent said the difficulty was affordability.&#160;</li>
<li>More than 60 percent of renters and half of the homeowners surveyed experienced "housing cost burden," which means they spend more than 30 percent of household income on housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Respondents were asked to share their views on a range of proposals, including rent control, strategies for building affordable housing and prioritizing who is eligible for it, the creation of workforce housing, and more.</p>
<p>"No Place Like Home is a student-engaged research project that is becoming a resource for the community," said McKay, noting that the project <a href="http://noplacelikehome.ucsc.edu/en/">website</a> will be updated Oct. 18 to highlight information about a number of policy proposals regarding affordable housing and tenant protection on the ballot in November.</p>
<p>Panelists on Oct. 18 include:&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Diana Alfaro, project manager for MidPen Housing Corporation in Watsonville</li>
<li>Miriam Greenberg, professor of sociology and director of the Critical Sustainabilities Project</li>
<li>Jack Jacobson, local landlord and attorney</li>
<li>Nicole Montojo, a housing research analyst with the UC Berkeley Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society</li>
<li>Cheryl Williams, senior clerk to the Santa Cruz County Assessment Appeals Board</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a wide range of community groups will be present, and representatives will be available to share information about issues such as affordable and alternative housing, tenant rights and protection, emergency rental assistance, homelessness, voter registration, and housing justice.</p>
<p>The event is being cosponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Center for Labor Studies, the Sociology Department, and the Division of Social Sciences; SEIU Local 521; Community Bridges; Community Action Board; and California Rural Legal Assistance.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3ae33b37807270170d8867fac506322e"><name>oakesnamechange</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oakes College Provost House name change honors visionary </title><summary>The Oakes Provost House will be renamed to honor Emeritus Professor and founding Oakes College Provost J.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emeritus Professor and founding Oakes College Provost J. Herman Blake gets emotional when he thinks of the Oakes Provost House, &#8220;the place where we built it all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was referring to the legacy he and his supporters built at Oakes, an &#8220;experimental&#8221; community that continues to thrive, 46 years after its inception in 1972. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The provost house was a place for students to set aside worries, cares, and turmoil, and have dinner with my family and me,&#8221; Blake recalled. &#8220;It was the center of the community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Blake&#8217;s many admirers on campus have moved to rededicate the provost house in Blake&#8217;s honor, in a renaming ceremony at 5:30 p.m. Oct. 30. Emeritus biology professor William T. Doyle, a UC Santa Cruz faculty member when campus opened in 1965, suggested the name change and is funding all related expenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake said he was &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; to hear about this honor. &#8220;In the provost </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">house, we saw it all. It reflected the extraordinary natural setting of UC Santa Cruz&#8212;the redwoods, the view of the bay, and all of nature&#8212;human nature, intellectual nature, and the social bond. All these things came together there.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provost house also brings up memories of working with staff and faculty who helped him implement a strong vision for Oakes. &#8220;At UC Santa Cruz, I encountered some of the most sensitive, passionate supporters,&#8217;&#8217; he said, mentioning UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s founding Chancellor Dean McHenry, founding Vice Chancellor for Business and Finance Hal Hyde, and Doyle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bill communicated key issues and ideas with me, even before we founded Oakes,&#8221; Blake recalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake started at UC Santa Cruz in 1966 when he accepted an offer to join as a professor of sociology. He was selected to serve as the founding provost for Oakes, which he did until 1984, when he left to become president of Tougaloo College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oakes provost Regina Langhout said the Oakes community is delighted to have the name changed to honor Blake. &#8220;His vision for Oakes was clear, and we continue to do our best to pursue this vision on a daily basis,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Langhout said the renaming does more than just honor a legacy. &#8220;It helps us to stay focused on our mission: to understand human diversity as an exceptional strength from which to engage in intellectual, academic, and personal inquiry to effect positive social and political change.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal, a distinguished astrophysicist as well as a founding Oakes faculty member who worked closely with Blake, said the name change could not be more timely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In times of social inequality and economic divisions, the message and the mission of Oakes College is just as vital and relevant as ever, and the college, in the best sense of the word, bears the imprint of its founding provost, J. Herman Blake,&#8221; Blumenthal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blumenthal noted that Oakes, in its early days, was often described as an &#8220;experiment,&#8221; but while most experiments are fleeting, Oakes is a thriving community to this day. &#160;Renaming the Oakes Provost House &#8220;is more than just a fitting tribute to a pioneering leader and educator. It will also help sustain the name, and the legacy, of J. Herman Blake to future scholars living and learning at Oakes.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3b95881a807270170d8867fa1505d08f"><name>prescribed-burns</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Prescribed burn on Friday</title><summary>As announced last fall, CAL FIRE is planning to conduct a number of prescribed burns cooperatively with UC Santa Cruz through 2018. </summary><start-date>1538550000000</start-date><display-name>Prescribed burn on Friday</display-name><path>/2018/10/prescribed-burns</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/prescribed-burns</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1538597946386</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1539890420653</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/11/prescribed-burns.html" style="text-decoration-line: none;"><span style="background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">announced</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> last fall, CAL FIRE is planning to conduct a number of prescribed burns cooperatively with UC Santa Cruz through 2018. </span></p>

This can happen if something goes wrong during cell division, and it can lead to infertility, miscarriages, birth defects, or cancer. An estimated 30 percent of miscarriages are due to an incorrect number of chromosomes in the cells of the embryo.</p>
<p>Cell biologist Needhi Bhalla studies how chromosomes monitor themselves throughout the complex choreography of cell division to prevent such errors. Her research focuses on a special type of cell division, called meiosis, which produces eggs in females and sperm in males. This process is radically different from the cell division by which ordinary cells multiply (called mitosis).</p>
<p>"It's important to know how these basic biological mechanisms work so we can understand what happens when they go awry," said Bhalla, an associate professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz. "We know that having an incorrect number of chromosomes causes genetic disorders and birth defects. Understanding how that happens can help us prevent it or identify diagnostic markers so people will be in a better position to make decisions about reproductive health."</p>
<p><strong>Shuffling the deck</strong></p>
<p>When you consider everything the chromosomes have to do during meiosis, it's a wonder the process ever produces a viable egg or sperm. A key step, called recombination, involves chromosomes exchanging whole sections of DNA. It's like shuffling a deck of cards, and it's the reason siblings can be so different despite having the same parents.</p>
<p>"Recombination involves deliberately cutting the DNA, so it's fraught, and it's super interesting how cells have evolved to deal with that. You've got an error-prone mechanism, and layered over that is a complex structure to limit errors," Bhalla said.</p>
<p>Why is meiosis such an elaborate, error-prone process in the first place? As with most things in biology, the answer lies in evolution and natural selection. Sexual reproduction, with the shuffling of the decks through recombination during meiosis, generates the genetic diversity in offspring that is the raw material for natural selection.</p>
<p>"Meiosis generates new genetic combinations, and natural selection acts on that. Everything we see in evolution is a product of what happens in meiosis," Bhalla said.</p>
<p><strong>Checkpoints</strong></p>
<p>The chromosomal monitoring system she studies involves a series of checkpoints to ensure that each step in meiosis is completed properly before the cell moves on to the next step. The checkpoints are molecular mechanisms that can halt the cell cycle until everything is in order for the next step, and they can even cause a cell to self-destruct if errors have occurred.</p>
<p>In meiosis, there are a lot of steps to monitor. Most cells in the body have two sets of chromosomes, one set from the father and one from the mother. Egg and sperm cells have just one set of chromosomes so that fertilization, when egg and sperm merge, will produce an embryo with two sets of chromosomes. A key function of meiosis, then, is to accomplish that reduction to one set of chromosomes. It starts with the pairing of homologous chromosomes: chromosome 19 from mom pairs with chromosome 19 from dad, and so on.</p>
<p>When homologous chromosomes pair up, they assemble a structure called the synaptonemal complex that holds them together. At that point, recombination shuffles the genetic decks as the two homologous chromosomes exchange sections of DNA. Then the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the homologous chromosomes segregate into two daughter cells. And that's just part one.</p>
<p>"There is a checkpoint that makes sure the chromosomes are properly synapsed, a checkpoint that monitors recombination, another one that makes sure the chromosomes are attached to the apparatus that will separate them, and so on," Bhalla said.</p>
<p>Part two of meiosis involves the separation of duplicate chromosomes. Before meiosis or mitosis gets started, all the chromosomes make copies of themselves, and the copies (called sister chromatids) are held together. During mitosis and the second stage of meiosis, the sister chromatids segregate into separate daughter cells.</p>
<p><strong>Guardian spirit</strong></p>
<p>In a new study, published October 4 in <em>Current Biology</em>, Bhalla's lab studied a checkpoint molecule called shugoshin, which means "guardian spirit" in Japanese. Shugoshin was originally identified as important in meiosis for regulating how sister chromatids are held together at a structure called the centromere. Bhalla's lab found that it actually plays a much wider role in meiosis, setting up the correct structure of chromosomes and ensuring the proper progression of recombination.</p>
<p>"These proteins are multitaskers, and cells use them for multiple functions to make chromosomes do incredibly different things in different contexts," Bhalla said.</p>
<p>Chromosomes hold an organism's genetic blueprint in their DNA, but the DNA is just one part of a highly complex chromosomal structure involving many different proteins with different functions, from packaging the DNA to monitoring the behavior of the chromosome itself.</p>
<p>"Chromosomes participate in the monitoring of their own behavior. There's a beauty in that, because they are active participants where you would expect them to be passive," Bhalla said. "When you see cell division, with the chromosomes lining up and segregating, it seems like they are passive, but we know they are active participants, and their structure contributes to that."</p>
<p>In addition to Bhalla, the coauthors of the new study include graduate students Tisha Bohr (first author) and Christian Nelson, and research technicians Stefani Giacopazzi and Piero Lamelza.

He breathes in its wonders and can't imagine life without it.</p>
<p>Schwarz is fascinated by every living thing around him, from mushrooms and moths to majestic redwoods. And he is acutely aware of how precarious it all is: Climate change and human sprawl loom large in his consciousness. But the plight of the planet doesn't leave him feeling defeated. Instead, it spurs him to action.</p>
<p>With the infectious enthusiasm of one who has found his calling in life, Schwarz is empowering "citizen scientists" to document today's biodiversity in hopes of inspiring action before it's too late.</p>
<p>It's easy, it's fun, and everyone can do it, says Schwarz, demonstrating the process by grabbing his smart phone, snapping a photo of a redwood tree, and uploading it to a public database with an app that identifies the species, time, and location&#8212;all in less than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Using apps like iNaturalist, citizen scientists around the globe are creating thousands of records per day, each of which contains three simple pieces of information: an organism, a date, and a place. Collectively, the result is a "huge, dynamic book about the living world and how it's evolving."</p>
<p>"The great thing about citizen science is that it's less about what you know and more about how well you can share," said Schwarz (Stevenson '17; ecology and evolutionary biology). "You can be a dog walker who knows nothing about nature, but still make serious contributions to our understanding of climate change. Dog walkers are great because they're outside all the time."</p>
<p>Sitting on campus surrounded by redwoods, Schwarz acknowledged that it "may not seem important to document this redwood today, but 100 years from now, they may have died out in this part of the world because of climate change."</p>
<p>"Time is much bigger than we are, and organisms are moving through space and time," he added. "Only by sharing this information do we have a chance of understanding it in real time."</p>
<p>And people are heeding the call. iNaturalist was created by a group of UC Berkeley graduate students in 2008, and its use has exploded in recent years. Partnerships with the California Academy of Sciences and National Geographic ensure that growth will continue, which delights Schwarz, whose passion for the natural world took off at UCSC.</p>
<p><strong>A naturalist is born</strong></p>
<p>At 29, Schwarz has already co-authored <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mushrooms-Redwood-Coast-Comprehensive-California-ebook/dp/B0180T2Z0K/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535740857&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=schwarz+mushroom">Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast</a>, a comprehensive 600-page guide to the fungi of Coastal Northern California. Based on years of observation and collecting, the book was a labor of love for Schwarz and coauthor Noah Siegel.</p>
<p>"We realized if we wanted a modern and in-depth field guide, we were going to have to write it ourselves," said Schwarz, who was barely out of his teens when they began the project.</p>
<p>Today, Schwarz lectures about mushrooms all over the country and has amassed thousands of field journal entries, photographs, and specimens of dried fungi, which he donated to the Ken Norris Center for Natural History at UCSC. He and Siegel, as well as new co-author Thea Chesney, are hard at work on a book about mushrooms of the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>Ironically, as a kid, Schwarz thought mushrooms were "the most boring thing imaginable." His brother, inspired by a passage in <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, asked for a field guide for Christmas, which Schwarz thought was ridiculous.</p>
<p>"But it was a really rainy winter, and there were mushrooms everywhere, and it's like a switch flipped," he said. "I never looked back."</p>
<p>When it came time to apply to college, he chose UCSC for its location among the redwoods. "I wanted to go into the woods between classes," he said. And that's exactly what he did.</p>
<p>One day, Schwarz spied a cluster of purple mushrooms among the redwood needles behind the Engineering 2 building on upper campus. It turned out to be a new species&#8212;and only the second sighting of the genus in California. Today it's known as <em>Pseudobaeospora deckeri</em>&#8212;named after Schwarz's high school teacher, Lee Decker.</p>
<p>"I always told him if I ever discovered anything, I'd name it after him," said Schwarz.</p>
<p><strong>Branching out beyond fungi and building networks</strong></p>
<p>As a child, Schwarz loved exploring tide pools, but he was pretty singleminded about fungi until a fateful trip to Borneo. His first night in the hostel, he stepped outside only to discover thousands and thousands of moths covering the walls, attracted to the porch light. Mesmerized by the colors, patterns, and variety, he spent the next three days photographing moths.</p>
<p>"Once the bubble burst, I started paying attention to everything," he said.</p>
<p>Now he shares his zeal with everyone he encounters. A Marin County teacher recently invited him to teach a weeklong class on fungi, which began with a Monday hike to gather specimens, followed by a simple DNA extraction. "My co-instructor Damon Tighe took the samples to San Francisco for analysis, and we got the sequences on Friday," recalled Schwarz. The students posted the results on iNaturalist, including a couple of sequences that were the first for those fungi.</p>
<p>"They were so stoked!" said Schwarz, who delights in how easy social media has made it for anyone&#8212;from a child to an academic&#8212;to contribute to the hyper-collaborative book that's being written about the natural world. "I don't think I'd be interested in organisms nearly as much if I didn't have someone to tell about it."</p>
<p><strong>Cataloging discovery</strong></p>
<p>With a $15,000 grant from the Santa Cruz Fungus Federation, Schwarz is sequencing the DNA of 650 mushroom specimens. The result is one of the most deeply documented open-source repositories of fungal DNA in North America, according to Schwarz, who fields requests from researchers who need specimens for further analysis.</p>
<p>Still, the repository only scratches the surface of Schwarz's collection of thousands of specimens, housed in the Norris Center. Some might call what Schwarz does "glorified stamp collecting," but he sees his work as foundational, because it gives researchers the tools they need to ask "more interesting" questions about ecology and evolutionary history.</p>
<p>There is one area of research Schwarz wants to pursue himself, however, and that is monitoring how the life cycles of animals and plants change in response to variation in climate. Consider, he says, the annual spring wildflower bloom, the insects that hatch during the bloom, and the migrating birds that feast on caterpillars and other critters. "If there's a mismatch in timing, it can be devastating&#8212;no insects to pollinate the wildflowers&#8230; or no food for the birds," said Schwarz.</p>
<p>By integrating the age-old skill of observation with 21st century technological innovation, Schwarz is modeling a new way of learning and communicating about nature&#8212;and perhaps the future of conservation, as well.</p>

Gothic classic, <em>Strange Window: The Turn of the Screw</em>--directed by acclaimed stage director and UC Santa Cruz theater arts professor Marianne Weems--will take place October 12-14 on campus at the Experimental Theater in the Theater Arts Center.</p>
<p>Presented by the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division, in partnership with the Theater Arts Department, this new adaptation of the 1898 horror novella is a production by the New York-based and Obie Award-winning theater company, The Builders Association.</p>
<p>Professor Weems, who joined the UC Santa Cruz arts faculty just last year, is the artistic director and co-founder of The Builders Association, where she has directed all of its productions since 1994. <br/><br/>The company is an influential theatrical ensemble that has created a significant body of work at the cutting edge of integrating media with performance. <br/><br/>As UCSC theater arts professor Michael Chemers notes, "The Builders broke traditional artistic boundaries by including architects, media designers, software engineers, and visual artists, and pushing the boundaries of experimental theater. Since 1994, their 17 original productions have appeared in 80 major theatrical venues in every corner of the world, and they have consistently innovated with new technologies within the very old form of theater."<br/><br/>The UCSC performances of <em>Strange Window: The Turn of the Screw</em> offer Santa Cruz audiences a brief window to see this world-class production locally, before the same production moves on to its East Coast premiere at The Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), as part of the 2018 Next Wave Festival.</p>
<p>"The Arts Division could not be more pleased to be collaborating with this prestigious consortium to bring this important work before the public," said UC Santa Cruz arts dean Susan Solt. "We are delighted that in only one year as a member of the UC Santa Cruz theater arts faculty, Marianne Weems has merged her teaching practice with her professional practice as co-founder and artistic director of The Builders Association."<br/><br/>"This is just the kind of intersection between artists supported in academia who are also artists out in the world that I am positioning to make a unique part of the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division with my signature initiative in creative entrepreneurship under the title &#8216;Artist 21,'" Solt added.</p>
<p>James&#8217;s <em>The Turn of the Screw</em> was originally published as a weekly serial in <em>Collier&#8217;s Weekly</em>, and the novella has since been adapted in numerous ways for both the stage and the screen, perhaps most famously for the 1961 film, <em>The Innocents</em>. It&#8217;s a classic Gothic ghost story set in a remote English country manor.</p>
<p><em>Strange Window: The Turn of the Screw</em> is co-commissioned by BAM and The Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where it opened in September for its world premiere. The production is co-produced by the Arts Division of UC Santa Cruz, and 3LD Art &amp; Technology.<br/><br/>"It&#8217;s a great honor to have our West Coast premiere at UC Santa Cruz, and to be a part of the momentum that Dean Solt is building in the Arts Division," said Weems. "I am excited to expand the spectrum of theater available in Santa Cruz and the Bay Area, and think that seeing this old-fashioned ghost story told with our 21st-century tools will be a visceral and thought-provoking encounter."<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><em>Tickets for the performances at UC Santa Cruz are available

new grants</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="https://www.sccbg.org/">Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group</a> (SCCBG), a local charity supporting cancer research and patient care, has awarded three grants of $20,000 each for one-year cancer research projects at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The grant recipients are <strong>Karen Ottemann</strong> and <strong>Fitnat Yildiz</strong>, both professors of microbiology and environmental toxicology, for research on chronic bacterial infections and carcinogenesis; <strong>Rebecca DuBois</strong>, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, for research on the molecular mechanisms of a new class of immune checkpoint inhibitor; and <strong>Christopher Vollmers</strong>, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, for a project to identify better targets for cancer immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Since 2005, the SCCBG has given more than $500,000 in grants to UCSC cancer researchers.</p>
<p>Ottemann and Yildiz will collaborate on a study of the human pathogen <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, which causes inflammation in the stomach that can lead to ulcers or stomach cancer. They aim to characterize several genes involved in the formation of biofilms, a growth mode which is highly resistant to antibiotics and difficult for the body to eliminate. Understanding biofilms in <em>H. pylori</em> and how they affect chronic infection, cancer development, and antibiotic resistance could lead to identification of biofilm inhibitors as potential treatments for <em>H. pylori</em> disease.</p>
<p>DuBois will investigate cancer immunotherapies in collaboration with researchers at Trellis Bioscience. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors stop cancer cells from triggering the &#8220;off switch&#8221; of immune cells such as effector T cells, allowing the T cells to attack the tumor. Natural Killer (NK) cells are another type of immune cell with potential to kill cancer cells. A new class of checkpoint inhibitors that mask the &#8220;off switches&#8221; of NK cells is in development but has shown mixed results clinically. DuBois aims to uncover at atomic detail how these new inhibitors work, providing a basis to engineer improved inhibitors as a cancer therapy.</p>
<p>Vollmers is also interested in cancer immunotherapy. His project focuses on identifying all variants (called isoforms) of proteins on the surface of B cells. Out-of-control growth of B cells can cause several types of cancer, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chromic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma. Immunotherapy that targets proteins on the cell surface can be effective, but cancer cells often evade recognition by changing the isoforms of these proteins. Vollmers aims to systematically and accurately identify the vast majority of protein isoforms present in B cells, and use this knowledge to identify better targets for future immunotherapy approaches.</p>
<p>The SCCBG holds several annual events to raise funds for the programs it supports.

<p>I genuinely appreciate all the wise feedback on the draft SAP and implementation guide, and I want to commend the Academic Senate for working earnestly over the summer to review the draft. The Senate&#8217;s work has enabled us to move forward faculty hiring and to address resource needs.</p>
<p>In reviewing the detailed comments, it became clear to me that it would be of great value to turn back to our community to continue discussions around the implementation of our Design Principles &#8212; the characteristics we say define our community &#8212; allowing more time to suggest, evaluate, and prioritize our target outcomes. Your input will be critical in developing implementation initiatives. We will work this fall to rewrite the plan and craft a more UC Santa Cruz-style document, then distribute it for further comment, encouraging feedback through the end of winter quarter.</p>
<p>The Senate and others also suggested faculty leadership for the Academic Priority Areas, and I am pleased to announce&#160;<a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/about-sap/#people">faculty leadership teams</a>&#160;for each of the APAs. The co-leaders, with the assistance of associate leaders, will collaborate to bring focus to the APAs and work with the deans to shape faculty hiring. I anticipate that much of the hiring next year will be positions that relate to the APAs, while we continue to support graduate growth and critical undergraduate curricular needs.</p>
<p>The Themed Academic Working Groups produced so many innovative and exciting collaborations that I have made a decision to dedicate some of our limited resources to catalyze faculty initiatives and to continue to support the lively energy the TAWG process awakened. While not all of our faculty will participate directly in these initiatives &#8212; and, as we know, it is the range and depth of our work as a comprehensive university that makes us who we are &#8212; the entire campus community will benefit from our efforts to move forward on these fronts.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is one of the most remarkable universities in the nation, and, indeed, in the world. We offer an innovative, insightful and humane model for the future of higher education. We must support the efforts of our exceptional faculty and students, their leading-edge thinking, research, creative work, and scholarship, and heighten their visibility. I believe our Strategic Academic Plan will help us to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, as a reminder, please join Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee for our&#160;<a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/cafe_sap#.W7ZF5S2ZNcB">first Cafe SAP event</a>, 8:30&#8211;9:30 a.m. this coming Wednesday at the Music Center patio. All interested faculty, staff, and students are invited to stop by, ask questions, or simply share thoughts and comments about the SAP.

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mjbolte/40439907012/in/datetaken/"></a>Photos taken in the last few days show a campus bobcat suffering from this mange. There are a number of methods to effectively control rats that do not require poisons. These include removing pest attractants from your home, eliminating access points for pests and non-chemical traps.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Despite leading the nation in economic growth since 2001, the vast majority of workers in Silicon Valley have been excluded from the area&#8217;s enormous economic boom, according to the results of a new study that reveals that nearly nine in ten jobs pay less today than they did 20 years ago.</p>
<p>The study was led by Chris Benner, professor of sociology and environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, where he is the director of the Everett Program and the Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation. A report brief, "<a href="https://www.wpusa.org/research/innovating-inequality/">Innovating Inequality? How Tech's Business Models Concentrate Wealth While Shortchanging Workers</a>," is available online; the full report, "<a href="http://www.everettprogram.org/main/wp-content/uploads/TIGHTROPE-2018-REPORT.pdf">Still Walking the Lifelong Tightrope: Technology, Insecurity and the Future of Work</a>," is also online.</p>
<p>The tech sector has developed and propagated business models that give outsized rewards to a few top investors and executives, at the price of increasing financial insecurity for everyone else who contributes to the industry&#8217;s success, said Benner.</p>
<p>"Tech investors and executives are receiving disproportionately large earnings, as they capture unfair returns in winner-take-all markets and from monopoly technology rents, to the detriment of Silicon Valley&#8217;s workers and residents," said Benner. "This isn&#8217;t about technology increasing inequality, it&#8217;s about the rules and rewards that determine who benefits from innovation."</p>
<p><strong>The study found:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past two decades, per capita economic output in Silicon Valley increased 74 percent, yet inflation-adjusted wages fell for nearly 90 percent of jobs.</li>
<li>The proportion of middle- and high-paid jobs in the area has decreased during the past 20 years, while the proportion of low-paid jobs grew.</li>
<li>Workers&#8217; declining share of Silicon Valley&#8217;s GDP has cost the average Silicon Valley worker $8,480 in annual earnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://wpusa.org/">Working Partnerships USA</a> collaborated in the research for the report.</p>
<p>"Cities across the country are falling head over heels to emulate Silicon Valley&#8217;s boom, but the reality is that tech's business models mean 9 in 10 workers here don&#8217;t share in the benefits&#8212;only the costs in sky-high housing prices and gridlocked traffic," said Derecka Mehrens, executive director of Working Partnerships USA. "It&#8217;s clear those business models need to change&#160;so that the workers and communities who make the tech industry&#8217;s success possible see a fair return on their work."</p>
<p>The authors identified a set of concrete actions Silicon Valley&#8217;s communities, policymakers, and tech industry leaders can take so that all the workers who contribute to the industry share in its success, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring workers have a voice on the job and the freedom to stand together and negotiate a fair return on their work.</li>
<li>Setting responsible contracting standards to ensure tech&#8217;s subcontracted service and supply chain workers are paid livable wages and have critical benefits like affordable healthcare and paid leave.</li>
<li>Working with surrounding communities to address the consequences of tech growth -- especially sky-high housing costs and the resulting displacement -- and pay their fair share to fund essential public services.</li>

<p>The awards were presented at the annual Fall breakfast hosted by Social Sciences Dean Katharyne Mitchell.</p>
<p>"Every year, we get together to celebrate our achievements and to show appreciation to the people whose hard work makes this division exceptional," said Mitchell. "It's a highlight of the year to honor the achievements and contributions of people across the Division of Social Sciences."</p>
<p>The four awards presented today were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Golden Apple Teaching Award: </strong>Cindy Cruz, an associate professor of education, was recognized for her enthusiasm, innovative teaching practices, and for "working tirelessly to address social justice issues in all her courses and to support all students&#8217; learning and understanding." Students consistently rate her teaching as exceptional, and the selection committee recognized her dedication to supporting students of color, first-generation college students, LGBTQ students, and those who need extra support to develop their writing skills. Cruz, who joined the faculty in 2008, received a $2,500 cash award and a golden apple trophy.</li>
<li><strong>Martin M. Chemers Award for Outstanding Research</strong>: Anthropology Professor Lisa Rofel was recognized as a leading China scholar whose expertise includes the transition from socialism to capitalism and related issues of gender, labor, and social inequality, as well as queerness in the new China. Rofel has produced "substantial and influential" publications and was cited for her leadership of a new project, <em>The Twenty-First Century Silk Road</em>, which has attracted considerable support from the National Science Foundation. Rofel is also the inaugural director of the Center for Emerging Worlds at UCSC, which focuses on understanding the global transformations of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and making the world more just. Rofel, who joined the faculty in 1991, received a $2,500 cash prize and a crystal trophy.</li>
<li><strong>Outstanding Staff Awards: </strong>Two recipients were selected this year: Tina Cossaboom, the undergraduate program advisor in Sociology, and Betsy Tyler, the academic payroll coordinator for the Division of Social Sciences. Cossaboom was recognized for going "over and beyond" in her advising to ensure that students graduate on time. Last year, Cossaboom single-handedly created a peer-mentoring program that supports undergraduates and gives mentors valuable experience in counseling and working with a wide range of students. She was lauded as being "extremely organized," an excellent communicator, and "generous of spirit." Tyler was recognized as one of the "unsung heroes" who labors behind the scenes, providing outstanding service in support of the operations of the Division. The selection committee noted that "every single person who interacts with her always sings her praises and recognizes her value to the division." The co-recipients will share the $2,000 cash prize and each will receive a plaque.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong> Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Award: </strong>Rodney Ogawa, professor emeritus of education, was honored for his leadership role in the Silicon Valley Regional Data Trust, an ambitious data-sharing initiative that supports more than 400,000 public school children in Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and San Mateo counties. The data trust is designed to connect educators with social service providers to improve the educational outcomes of youth.&#160;Ogawa shepherded the initiative from concept to an active partnership that has been identified by the State Assembly as a pilot project for California. Ogawa joined the faculty in 2002 and retired in 2015. The award includes a plaque.</li>

<p>Academy fellows are a governing group of more than 450 distinguished scientists and other leaders who have made notable contributions to science or science education and communication. Nominated by their colleagues and selected by the board of trustees, the fellows are partners and collaborators in the pursuit of the academy's mission to explore, explain, and sustain life.</p>
<p>Elected for 2018 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claire Max</strong>, Bachmann Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and director of <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/home/index.html">UC Observatories</a>;</li>
<li><strong>Beth Shapiro</strong>, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology; and</li>
<li><strong>Natalie Batalha</strong>, who joined the UCSC faculty in October as a professor of astronomy and astrophysics after serving as Kepler project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three new fellows join 29 other UCSC faculty as fellows of the academy, as well as four more who are honorary fellows. The new fellows were inducted at a meeting of the academy on October 9.</p>
<p>Max is a pioneer in the field of adaptive optics, a technology that removes the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing telescopes on the ground to see as clearly as if they were in space. She earned her undergraduate degree from Radcliffe College and a Ph.D. from Princeton University and worked as a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. At UC Santa Cruz she served as director of the Center for Adaptive Optics. Max&#8217;s current research interests include using adaptive optics and laser guide stars to dramatically improve astronomical images. She uses these tools at the Lick and Keck Observatories to study the fate of supermassive black holes during mergers of nearby galaxies.</p>
<p>Shapiro is an evolutionary biologist who specializes in the genetics of ice age animals and plants. She develops techniques to recover increasingly trace amounts of DNA from museum, environmental, and forensic samples, and then uses these data to study how species and ecosystems evolved through time. She is particularly interested in understanding how human activities affect this dynamic process. A 2009 MacArthur Fellow, Shapiro is also an award-winning popular science author and communicator who uses her research as a platform to explore the potential of new genomic technologies for conservation and medicine.</p>
<p>As an astrophysicist at NASA Ames Research Center, Batalha has been working to detect and characterize planets orbiting other stars, with the ultimate goal of finding evidence of life beyond our solar system. Batalha earned a B.S. in physics at UC Berkeley and a Ph.D. in astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. She served as the science lead for NASA&#8217;s Kepler mission from 2011 to 2017 and led the analysis that yielded the 2011 discovery of Kepler-10b, the mission&#8217;s first confirmation of a rocky planet outside our solar system. Batalha was awarded a NASA Public Service Medal and the Smithsonian Ingenuity Award for her work.</p>

<p>The award will be presented at the <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/founders/index.html">Founders Celebration</a> on Saturday, October 20. Batalha will also be joining the faculty of UCSC&#8217;s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked and lived here as a student and raised my children in UCSC&#8217;s Family Student Housing. I&#8217;m very excited to be coming back in this new role with two decades of experience under my belt, ready to give back to the academic community,&#8221; Batalha said. &#8220;It feels a lot like coming home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, said Batalha is among the top planetary astronomers of her generation. &#8220;There is no question that Natalie is an outstanding scientist, but she is also a rare phenomenon, the kind of leader who comes along once in a generation. We need her vision, her energy, and her charisma here at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She will be a game changer for our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>From 2011 to 2017, Batalha served as the science lead for NASA&#8217;s highly successful Kepler Mission, which discovered more than 2,500 exoplanets. In 2017, she was named to <em>Time</em> magazine&#8217;s list of the &#8220;100 most influential people in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batalha earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in physics at UC Berkeley and received her doctoral degree from UC Santa Cruz in 1997. After a post-doctoral fellowship in Brazil, she returned to California, taking a position at San Jose State University as a professor of astronomy and astrophysics and joining the exoplanet discovery team at NASA Ames Research Center led by space scientist William Borucki.</p>
<p>Borucki was working on transit photometry, then an emerging technology for finding exoplanets. He led the planning for and became principal investigator of the Kepler Mission, launched in 2009 to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of sun-like stars. Batalha was involved with the Kepler Mission from the proposal stage and contributed to many different aspects of the science, from studying the stars themselves to detecting and understanding the planets they harbor. As her leadership role in the mission grew, so did her responsibilities. After ten years at San Jose State University, she moved to the Astrophysics Branch of the Space Sciences Division of NASA Ames Research Center to fully dedicate her time to the Kepler Mission.</p>
<p>Batalha led Kepler&#8217;s first efforts to generate high-reliability catalogs of planet detections. She also led the analysis that yielded the discovery in 2011 of Kepler-10b, the mission&#8217;s first confirmation of a rocky planet outside our solar system. In 2011, she was awarded a NASA Public Service Medal for her vision in communicating Kepler science to the public and for outstanding leadership in coordinating the Kepler Science Team. She has also received the Lecar Prize from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Smithsonian Ingenuity Award for the Physical Sciences.</p>
<p>In 2015, Batalha joined the leadership team of a new NASA initiative dedicated to the search for evidence of life beyond the solar system. NASA&#8217;s Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) brings teams from multiple disciplines together to understand the diversity of worlds. Kepler has demonstrated that Earth-size planets abound in the galaxy. NExSS contributes to NASA's efforts to understand which are most likely to harbor life.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, Batalha will explore the diversity of planets in the galaxy using space-based telescopes like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), as well as UC&#8217;s ground-based telescopes like those at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the future Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). She will also bring multiple disciplines of study together to explore the broader question of planetary habitability.</p>
<p>Batalha noted that UC Santa Cruz has a world-class astronomy department that includes renowned theoreticians modeling the formation, evolution, and atmospheres of planets. &#8220;UCSC also has key expertise in Earth, planetary, and biological sciences critical for understanding the limits of planetary habitability and the propensity for life in the galaxy,&#8221; she said, adding that she hopes to see all of these perspectives gathered around the same table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kepler catalyzed the search for evidence of life beyond the solar system. UCSC can play a significant role in making that vision a reality,&#8221; Batalha said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f4c6e28807270172739340f6ba340a3"><name>griggs-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Gary Griggs covers region's history of natural disasters in new book</title><summary>Griggs puts the natural disasters of recent decades into historical context in his latest book, 'Between Paradise and Peril: The Natural Disaster History of the Monterey Bay Region.'</summary><keywords>Gary Griggs, Between Paradise and Peril</keywords><start-date>1539266400000</start-date><display-name>Gary Griggs covers region's history of natural disasters in new book</display-name><path>/2018/10/griggs-book</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/griggs-book</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1539197135451</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1539269952778</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Publications</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/cover-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/cover-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-400.jpg</name><display-name>cover-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>156488</file-size><width>400</width><height>454</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>gary-griggs-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20540</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Gary Griggs</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/gary-griggs-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/gary-griggs-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gary-griggs-300.jpg</name><display-name>gary-griggs-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>56912</file-size><width>300</width><height>247</height></image><image-alt>Gary Griggs</image-alt><image-caption>Gary Griggs</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In his 50 years on the faculty at UC Santa Cruz, geologist Gary Griggs has witnessed a lot of natural disasters in the local area, including floods, landslides, earthquakes, and destructive coastal storms. A distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences and former director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, Griggs puts the natural disasters of recent decades into historical context in his latest book, <em>Between Paradise and Peril: The Natural Disaster History of the Monterey Bay Region</em>.</p>
<p>In a way, Griggs has been gathering material for this book for the past 50 years. The inspiration for writing it all down, however, came from the unexpectedly large turnout for a talk he gave on the subject in 2017 at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I realized people are inherently interested in natural disasters and in the history of their local area," he said.</p>
<p>The collective memory of natural disasters tends to fade rapidly, however, and recurrent events such as floods and coastal storm damage take many people by surprise despite their long and well-documented histories. Griggs said he hopes the book will raise awareness of the vulnerability to natural disasters that goes hand in hand with the natural beauty of the Monterey Bay region, noting that Santa Cruz County arguably has more geologic hazards per square mile than any of California&#8217;s other 57 counties.</p>
<p>"These things don't happen every year, and people move here from other places, so they may not realize the risks that come with that condo on the beach or that house in the mountains with a creek running through the backyard," he said. "When you see the history of these events, you realize there's nothing new or unusual about them."</p>
<p>The book is well illustrated with more than 200 photos Griggs culled from his own collection and from various regional archives. After a thorough introduction to the region's natural hazards, the book offers a deep dive into each category of hazards in chapters on earthquakes, tsunamis, coastal storms and shoreline erosion, flooding, landslides and mudflows, and droughts. A final chapter addresses how the risks from some natural disasters are being heightened by climate change.</p>
<p>The consequences of climate change include sea-level rise, warmer temperatures, and changing precipitation patterns. Events such as drought, flooding, wildfires, and coastal storm damage are likely to increase in frequency and intensity. At the same time, the population of the Monterey Bay region has grown tremendously in recent decades, putting a much larger number of people at risk from natural hazards.</p>
<p>Griggs is not an alarmist, but he does hope to make more people aware of the natural disasters that have struck this area regularly in the past and are bound to do so again, perhaps with even greater intensity and frequency. "So many people are disconnected from the natural environment, I hope this book can give them a better sense of place," he said.</p>
<p>Griggs will be speaking about his new book at <a href="https://www.bookshopsantacruz.com/event/gary-griggs-between-paradise-and-peril">Bookshop Santa Cruz</a> on November 8 and at the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> on November 29.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f504879807270172739340fc63a2aea"><name>beyond-compliance-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Beyond Compliance Forum</title><summary>I am pleased to announce that my office has scheduled a Beyond Compliance Forum for 4–6 p.m. Oct. 11 at Kresge Town Hall.

The meeting will focus on what we are doing to address and prevent sexual violence and sexual harassment on our campus.</p>
<p>This forum, which I feel is especially important as we start a new academic year, will bring together the many units and programs on campus working to address SVSH. Among the organizations that will be in attendance: Beyond Compliance; Campus Advocacy, Resources, and Education (CARE); Respondent Support Services; Title IX; and the Student Union Assembly. Students from the Title IX Student Advisory Board, a systemwide policy group focused on sexual violence prevention and response, also will be on hand.</p>
<p>Each group will offer a short overview of their work, and what they have planned for the year. Attendees will then have the opportunity to ask questions, and to share concerns and ideas. Nancy Heischman, director of Campus Conflict Resolution Services, will facilitate the event.</p>
<p>Both the Title IX and CARE offices have new directors in place, so the forum also provides a chance to meet them.</p>
<p>Our Beyond Compliance initiative was launched in 2016, under former Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway, to engage faculty in helping to reshape campus culture with the goal of creating an environment free from SVSH. Since the launch of our campus initiative, we have revised policies, sought wider community input, and held forums to have open discussions on the topic. We aim to extend the impact of all our initiatives by bringing these important groups together.</p>
<p>Sexual violence and sexual harassment violate the values of our campus, and we are working earnestly to create a campus where everyone feels welcome, safe, and treated equitably.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Celebration Dinner, on Saturday, October 20, will include a special conversation about truth, democracy, and the power of the pen, featuring a panel of three Banana Slugs at the top of their game.</span></p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t done so already, the deadline to register to vote is October 22, 2018 and you can register in California online: <a href="https://registertovote.ca.gov/">https://registertovote.ca.gov/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Election season also brings robust campaigning</strong><br/>While we are glad to see our community is engaged with the various contests and topics, I want to remind everyone that there are legal restrictions on University of California involvement in political campaign activities based on the status of the university as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization and as a state entity.</p>
<p>Specifically, the university may not endorse/oppose (or contribute to) political candidates, nor may university resources (including university-paid time or equipment) be used for campaign purposes in connection with ballot propositions or measures.</p>
<p>While it is important to ensure that voters are informed and engaged, it is also important to abide by University of California policies around the appropriate rules of &#8220;time, place, and manner.&#8221; We want to ensure fairness in our elections processes and that we are not using state resources or facilities for campaign purposes and that information is presented in a balanced manner.</p>
<p>To this end, state law and University policies (<a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/pdf/30.0-policy-speech-advocacy.pdf">Policy on Speech and Advocacy</a> and <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/pdf/40.0-policy-use-university-properties.pdf">Policy on use of university properties</a>), provide guidelines on how and where campaign materials may &#160;be posted on campus. Please also note that those wishing to post materials at certain locations must check with that location to ensure compliance with the posting rules and procedures of the particular location</p>
<p>Organizations and individuals not affiliated with the university must also comply with the <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3000127/NonAffiliateRegs">Regulations Governing Conduct of Non-Affiliates in the Buildings and on the Grounds of the University of California</a> and may post and distribute materials only on bulletin boards designated for public use: outdoor kiosks and the interior of bus shelters.

<p>That episode features UC Santa Cruz arts alumna and book artist <strong>Felicia Rice</strong>, along with weaver Kay Sekimachi; textile designer and founder of LongHouse Reserve, Jack Lenor Larsen; collector Forrest L. Merrill; and artists of Black Mountain College.</p>
<p>It will air on PBS later this year, beginning on December 18.</p>
<p>The night before the screening, Rice will also be featured in conversation with PBS producer Carol Sauvion at the Craft in America Center in Los Angeles. They will discuss the UCSC alumna&#8217;s 40-year career as an artist and collaborator.</p>
<p>Rice (Cowell '78) received her degree from UC Santa Cruz as an independent major in Fine Art Printing.</p>
<p>Her work is currently featured in <strong><em><a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/exhibitions/artists_books/index.html">Artists and Their Books / Books and Their Artists</a></em></strong>, an exhibition now running at the Getty Research Institute through October 28.</p>
<p>Rice came to UC Santa Cruz in 1974<span>&#160;</span>to learn the craft of letterpress printing and the art of bookmaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began the work that has shaped my life at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Rice noted. &#8220;I studied the history of the book and worked closely with pivotal figures of the West Coast book art world--Jack Stauffacher and William Everson.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1977, while still a student, she also founded<span>&#160;</span><strong><a href="http://www.movingpartspress.com/">Moving Parts Press</a></strong><span>&#160;</span>in a garage downtown and began her career as a printer, teacher, literary/fine arts publisher, and book artist. Work from Moving Parts Press has been included in exhibitions and collections both nationally and internationally--from book shows in New York and Frankfurt to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.</p>
<p>Moving Parts Press has also received numerous awards and grants from organizations that include the National Endowment for the Arts and the French Ministry of Culture.</p>
<p>As the Craft in America Center notes, &#8220;Felicia has one foot firmly planted in the 19th century and the other in the 21st. A student of the history of the book and typography, she also utilizes digital technology to produce letterpress artists&#8217; books of radical art. She has been collaborating with Chicanx visual and performing artists, writers, and philosophers for over 25 years.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/experimental-book-art.html</url><title>Five artists collaborate on experimental book art</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2008/03/2007.html</url><title>Felicia Rice honored with Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="69f81f5d807270172739340f3f456e31"><name>strike-notice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Information and resources about upcoming strike activities</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz received notice on Oct. 12, 2018 that there will be a labor strike beginning 4 a.m. on October 23 and ending at 3:59 a.m. on October 26, 2018 by AFSCME patient care technical workers.&#13;

In advance of this scheduled strike activity, we write to share some information and resources that you may find helpful.</p>
<p>The university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations which include picketing.</p>
<p>It is equally important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules. For example, UC policy does not allow free expression to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, to significantly infringe on the rights of others, or to block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings. When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.</p>
<p>Additionally, please remember that no employee is ever obligated to strike. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Staff members should remain in contact with their supervisors and managers to discuss their schedules and work locations.</p>
<p>If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor and your campus employee &amp; labor relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>Though we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus, we are working to do everything we can to ensure continued operations. TAPS Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle and regular Loop and Upper Campus shuttle services.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that three dining halls will be open during the strike; however, dining hall hours will be limited from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and the types of prepared food available will be limited as well. We also anticipate that all cafes and restaurants operated by UC Santa Cruz Dining may be closed.</p>
<p>We also anticipate that the Student Health Services will be open during the strike, but will have limited services. The health center has recommended that students proactively take care of any immediate health care needs. In the event that a student needs immediate access to telephone crisis assessment, please direct UCSC students to call (831) 459-2628, and select option &#8220;3&#8221; (talk to counselor) on the automated menu. The student will be connected to a crisis counselor who can provide immediate consultation and support by phone.</p>
<p>If you have questions about campus operations on strike days, information will be posted on a special web site: <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/advisory/">http://www.ucsc.edu/advisory/</a>, recorded on the campus communication hotline (459-INFO), provided to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast, and shared via the campus Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/ucsc">https://twitter.com/ucsc</a>). If access to the campus is not possible, further instructions to the campus community will be posted via these channels.</p>

The researchers fabricated electrodes using a printable graphene aerogel to build a porous three-dimensional scaffold loaded with pseudocapacitive material.</p>
<p>In laboratory tests, the novel electrodes achieved the highest areal capacitance (electric charge stored per unit of electrode surface area) ever reported for a supercapacitor, said Yat Li, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. Li and his collaborators reported their findings in a <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30458-6">paper published October 18 in <em>Joule</em></a>.</p>
<p>As energy storage devices, supercapacitors have the advantages of charging very rapidly (in seconds to minutes) and retaining their storage capacity through tens of thousands of charge cycles. They are used for regenerative braking systems in electric vehicles and other applications. Compared to batteries, they hold less energy in the same amount of space, and they don't hold a charge for as long. But advances in supercapacitor technology could make them competitive with batteries in a much wider range of applications.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/graphene-supercapacitor.html">earlier work</a>, the UCSC and LLNL researchers demonstrated ultrafast supercapacitor electrodes fabricated using a 3D-printed graphene aerogel. In the new study, they used an improved graphene aerogel to build a porous scaffold which was then loaded with manganese oxide, a commonly used pseudocapacitive material.</p>
<p>A pseudocapacitor is a type of supercapacitor that stores energy through a reaction at the electrode surface, giving it more battery-like performance than supercapacitors that store energy primarily through an electrostatic mechanism (called electric double-layer capacitance, or EDLC).</p>
<p>"The problem for pseudocapacitors is that when you increase the thickness of the electrode, the capacitance decreases rapidly because of sluggish ion diffusion in bulk structure. So the challenge is to increase the mass loading of pseudocapacitor material without sacrificing its energy storage capacity per unit mass or volume," Li explained.</p>
<p>The new study demonstrates a breakthrough in balancing mass loading and capacitance in a pseudocapacitor. The researchers were able to increase mass loading to record levels of more than 100 milligrams of manganese oxide per square centimeter without compromising performance, compared to typical levels of around 10 milligrams per square centimeter for commercial devices.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the areal capacitance increased linearly with mass loading of manganese oxide and electrode thickness, while the capacitance per gram (gravimetric capacitance) remained almost unchanged. This indicates that the electrode's performance is not limited by ion diffusion even at such a high mass loading.</p>
<p>First author Bin Yao, a graduate student in Li's lab at UC Santa Cruz, explained that in traditional commercial fabrication of supercapacitors, a thin coating of electrode material is applied to a thin metal sheet that serves as a current collector. Because increasing the thickness of the coating causes performance to decline, multiple sheets are stacked to build capacitance, adding weight and material cost because of the metallic current collector in each layer.</p>
<p>"With our approach, we don't need stacking because we can increase capacitance by making the electrode thicker without sacrificing performance," Yao said.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to increase the thickness of their electrodes to 4 millimeters without any loss of performance. They designed the electrodes with a periodic pore structure that enables both uniform deposition of the material and efficient ion diffusion for charging and discharging. The printed structure is a lattice composed of cylindrical rods of the graphene aerogel. The rods themselves are porous, in addition to the pores in the lattice structure. Manganese oxide is then electrodeposited onto the graphene aerogel lattice.</p>
<p>"The key innovation in this study is the use of 3D printing to fabricate a rationally designed structure providing a carbon scaffold to support the pseudocapacitive material," Li said. "These findings validate a new approach to fabricating energy storage devices using 3D printing."</p>
<p>Supercapacitor devices made with the graphene aerogel/manganese oxide electrodes showed good cycling stability, retaining more than 90 percent of initial capacitance after 20,000 cycles of charging and discharging. The 3D-printed graphene aerogel electrodes allow tremendous design flexibility because they can be made in any shape needed to fit into a device. The printable graphene-based inks developed at LLNL provide ultrahigh surface area, lightweight properties, elasticity, and superior electrical conductivity.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need to cancel journal subscriptions?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of journal subscriptions has significantly outpaced inflation</li>
<li>Inflationary and budgetary pressures forced a UC-wide revision to the <a href="https://guides-library-ucsc-edu.oca.ucsc.edu/serial_cancellations">historical cost sharing model</a> used to license and pay for UC systemwide journal packages and databases (Wiley, Springer, Project Muse, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why don&#8217;t I see certain journal titles on this survey?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Library has two basic types of journal subscriptions: our own local subscriptions and the large set of packages negotiated by the California Digital Library. This survey focuses on local journal subscriptions.</li>
<li>While the costs of both types of subscriptions are going up, we have full decision-making authority over our local journal subscriptions. Reviewing local subscriptions will allow us to make decisions that will help relieve the budgetary pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why should I participate in the survey?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The University Library wants to spend its collection funds on the resources most in need for your research and teaching. Your feedback about the journals we subscribe to is critical in ensuring that we understand the research and teaching needs of the campus community.</li>
<li>We specifically need your input about what journals you need immediate access to and what journals alternative methods for access like Interlibrary Loan will suffice. Interlibrary Loan article delivery averages 2-3 days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will final decisions be made and communicated?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We designed the survey to include the standard metrics used by academic libraries to assess the degree to which a title is consistently relied upon for research and teaching: usage data, cost per use, potential Interlibrary Loan costs (ILL), post-cancellation access rights, availability in an open access format, etc. These metrics, in conjunction with your assessment of the criticality of need and on-site/online availability for journal titles, will be the data we use to make recommendations for which journals to keep active or cancel.</li>
<li>We will share and discuss the results of the survey with COLASC and we will work closely with COLASC to make final keep/cancel recommendations.</li>
<li>Recommendations will be communicated to the Senate and campus community in March; feedback about those recommendations will be solicited through April.</li>

<p>This year&#8217;s Staff Appreciation Picnic will take place on April 30, 2019. We value your feedback! That&#8217;s why we are asking you to fill out this&#160;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1faSUK9eaTrBdtFhUhishubIFThfWwi09S0fn76KbpxquNA/viewform?usp=send_form">one-question poll</a>&#160;so we can incorporate staff preferences as we determine where to hold this year&#8217;s event. Your email address will be recorded so we can ensure there is only one vote per person.</p>
<p>With Chancellor George Blumenthal announcing his retirement, President Janet Napolitano is forming a search committee to find our next chancellor. The SAB is charged to send one person as the representative for UCSC staff on this search committee, and has elected Fiona Weigant (Staff Advisory Board Chair) to fill this role. In the near future, we will be reaching out to all campus staff to ask you for your input, so we can ensure we are representing your opinions accurately to the search committee and President Napolitano.</p>
<p>We are pleased to invite you to the SAB-sponsored Fall Chancellor Forum, wherein the chancellor will provide updates on the campus and answer any questions you may bring. Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2018</li>
<li>12&#8211;1:30 p.m.</li>
<li>Kresge Town Hall (<a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu/content/directions-kresge-town-hall">directions</a>)</li>
<li>To request accommodations, please email&#160;<a href="mailto:staffadv@ucsc.edu">staffadv@ucsc.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Managers and supervisors are strongly encouraged to provide release time to employees so they may attend this event. The SAB highly recommends that staff attend to hear about the important issues affecting staff and the university as a whole. We hope to see you there.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend and would like to forward your questions for Chancellor Blumenthal in advance, please email&#160;<a href="mailto:staffadv@ucsc.edu">staffadv@ucsc.edu</a>&#160;by 5 p.m. on Oct. 26, 2018.

<p>The meetings will be held from:</p>
<ul>
<li>6:30&#8211;8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 23 at the Louden Nelson Community Center, 301 Center St. Santa Cruz, CA; and</li>
<li>5&#8211;7 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 24 at Cruzioworks, 877 Center Street, Santa Cruz. <em>(Note: A new location has been selected, given possible disruptions next week.) </em></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://ppc.ucsc.edu/planning/EnvDoc.html#shw">revised draft EIR</a> is available online and is currently under a 45-day public review, which ends at 5:00 p.m. on November 1. Members of the public can provide public comment and input at the hearings noted above or may also email comments to <a href="mailto:eircomment@ucsc.edu. ">eircomment@ucsc.edu. </a></p>
<p>As many of you know, <a href="https://ucscstudenthousingwest.org">Student Housing West</a> is our bold plan to help address the critical housing crisis in our community. The plans call for building enough new housing to create 3,072 new beds on campus for our existing student population. The vast majority&#8212;2,900&#8212;would be at the current site of Family Student Housing along Heller Drive, and a new 140-unit Family Student Housing community, including a child care center, would be built on approximately 17 acres at the corner of Hagar and Coolidge drives.</p>
<p>This project is focused on helping to address today&#8217;s housing shortages with newly constructed beds primarily designed to house upper-division undergraduates and graduate students. For the most part, these students are currently living in the local community and have a strong desire to live on campus instead of competing in the local market. We believe this project is a win for our students and for our community.</p>
<p>Additionally, the new Family Student Housing site will include an expanded child-care center that will serve the children of faculty, staff, and students. The children of students are currently the only children eligible for care.</p>
<p>The Hagar location is proposed for several reasons, including its proximity to existing employee housing, the main campus entrance, and Westlake Elementary School.</p>
<p>The campus <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/09/student-housing-update.html">did make some changes</a> to the proposed project after our last public comment period concluded, including lowering the height of the buildings at the Heller site.</p>
<p>Once we collect more input through the public hearings, we hope to bring a proposed project to the UC Board of Regents in January for review and approval.</p>
<p>Our goal is to open the new community for family student housing in spring 2020, and to begin opening new buildings at Heller Drive in fall 2022 with full project completion by fall 2023.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7e14c4b4807270172739340fd5382809"><name>earthquake-preparedness-drill</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Earthquake preparedness drill and test of the UCSC emergency notification system, CruzAlert</title><summary>On October 18 at 10:18 a.m., UC Santa Cruz will participate in The Great California Shake Out, an earthquake awareness and preparedness campaign.</summary><start-date>1539630000000</start-date><display-name>Earthquake preparedness drill and test of the UCSC emergency notification system, CruzAlert</display-name><path>/2018/10/earthquake-preparedness-drill</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/earthquake-preparedness-drill</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1539713582231</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1539713934276</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear UC Santa Cruz Community,</p>

How these effects are transmitted across generations, however, remains mysterious.</p>
<p>Susan Strome's lab at UC Santa Cruz has been making steady progress in unraveling the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, using a tiny roundworm called <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> to show how marks on chromosomes that affect gene expression, called "epigenetic" marks, can be transmitted from parents to offspring. Her team's most recent paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06236-8">published October 17 in <em>Nature Communications</em></a>, focuses on transmission of epigenetic marks by <em>C. elegans</em> sperm.</p>
<p>In addition to documenting the transmission of epigenetic memory by sperm, the new study shows that the epigenetic information delivered by sperm to the embryo is both necessary and sufficient to guide proper development of germ cells in the offspring (germ cells give rise to eggs and sperm).</p>
<p>"We decided to look at <em>C. elegans</em> because it is such a good model for asking epigenetic questions using powerful genetic approaches," said Strome, a distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes do not alter the DNA sequences of genes, but instead involve chemical modifications to either the DNA itself or the histone proteins with which DNA is packaged in the chromosomes. These modifications influence gene expression, turning genes on or off in different cells and at different stages of development. The idea that epigenetic modifications can cause changes in gene expression that are transmitted from one generation to the next, known as "transgenerational epigenetic inheritance," is now the focus of intense scientific investigation.</p>
<p>For many years, it was thought that sperm do not retain any histone packaging and therefore could not transmit histone-based epigenetic information to offspring. Recent studies, however, have shown that about 10 percent of histone packaging is retained in both human and mouse sperm.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, where the chromosomes retain histone packaging of DNA is in developmentally important regions, so those findings raised awareness of the possibility that sperm may transmit important epigenetic information to embryos," Strome said.</p>
<p>When her lab looked at <em>C. elegans</em> sperm, they found the sperm genome fully retains histone packaging. Other researchers had found the same is true for another commonly studied organism, the zebrafish.</p>
<p>"Like zebrafish, worms represent an extreme form of histone retention by sperm, which makes them a great system to see if this packaging really matters," Strome said.</p>
<p>Her lab focused on a particular epigenetic mark (designated H3K27me3) that has been well established as a mark of repressed gene expression in a wide range of organisms. The researchers found that removing this mark from sperm chromosomes causes the majority of the offspring to be sterile. Having established that the mark is important, they wanted to see if it is sufficient to guide normal germline development.</p>
<p>The researchers addressed this by analyzing a mutant worm in which the chromosomes from sperm and egg are separated in the first cell division after fertilization, so that one cell of the embryo inherits only sperm chromosomes and the other cell inherits only egg chromosomes (normally, each cell of an embryo inherits chromosomes from both egg and sperm). This unusual chromosome segregation pattern allowed the researchers to generate worms whose germ line inherited only sperm chromosomes and therefore only sperm epigenetic marks. Those worms turned out to be fertile and to have normal gene expression patterns.</p>
<p>"These findings show that the DNA packaging in sperm is important, because offspring that did not inherit normal sperm epigenetic marks were sterile, and it is sufficient for normal germline development," Strome said.</p>
<p>While the study shows that epigenetic information transmitted by sperm is important for normal development, it does not directly address how the life experience of a father can affect the health of his descendants. Strome's lab is investigating this question with experiments in which worms are treated with alcohol or starved before reproducing.</p>
<p>"The goal is to analyze how the chromatin packaging changes in the parent," she said. "Whatever gets passed on to the offspring has to go through the germ cells. We want to know which cells experience the environmental factors, how they transmit that information to the germ cells, what changes in the germ cells, and how that impacts the offspring."</p>
<p>By demonstrating the importance of epigenetic information carried by sperm, the current study establishes that if the environment experienced by the father changes the epigenetics of sperm chromosomes, it could affect the offspring.</p>

<p>We have received numerous reports about chalking graffiti and fliers posted on campus with white nationalist/white supremacist messages. Such postings have occurred in the last several years. Given the continued tensions in our country, we are troubled&#8212;yet not surprised&#8212;to see them again.</p>
<p>These messages seek to divide our campus community. UC Santa Cruz is a community that champions our&#160;<a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Community</a>. Our diversity&#8212;in every form&#8212;makes us stronger. As a campus community, we stand against racism and white supremacy, and denounce and oppose all forms of hate, bias, and discrimination.</p>
<p>Many of our students have shared that the graffiti messages and fliers try to create hate through coded language. Still, the impact to our community is real. We want to emphasize with our campus community how the chalking graffiti and fliers make some members feel: unsafe, unwelcomed, threatened, and misunderstood. To our students: You are welcomed here and you belong here.</p>
<p>As a university, UC Santa Cruz is committed to continued education for faculty, staff, and students about different forms of oppression.</p>
<p>We appreciate everyone who reported the chalking graffiti and the fliers. If you come across hate-evoking graffiti or fliers, please immediately contact the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231 ext. 1.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a picture of the graffiti and/or the flier and include it in a report to&#160;<a href="https://reporthate.ucsc.edu/">https://reporthate.ucsc.edu/<br/></a></li>
<li>Inform a senior director of college student life, associate director of college student life, coordinator of residential education (CRE) supervisor, dean, or provost so they can assess whether the graffiti and/or the fliers were posted under proper posting protocols (all unauthorized postings, regardless of content, are removed).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Campus resources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A range of support services is available for students through the&#160;<a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/">Cowell Student Health Center</a>, including personal counseling through&#160;<a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a>.</li>
<li>For employees, the&#160;<a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a>&#160;can provide personal counseling and support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidents such as this&#8212;as unwelcome as they are&#8212;provide a moment to reaffirm our principles and values. UC Santa Cruz is a place that strives to welcome and include everyone, and we should all ensure we&#8217;re doing our part to co-create and co-sustain a healthy campus climate.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Teresa Maria Linda Scholz (Campus Diversity Office for Staff and Students), Jaye Padgett

<p>What are our chances for survival? How can we envision the unimaginable, and what will life look like in the near and distant future?</p>
<p>Faculty and students at UC Santa Cruz will explore these urgent issues over the next two years thanks to a $225,000 grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support &#8220;Beyond the End of the World&#8221;&#8212;a Sawyer Seminar on the Comparative Study of Cultures.</p>
<p>The project will bring leading international thinkers and cultural practitioners to UC Santa Cruz to deliver a series of public lectures and will include post-doctoral and dissertation-level research.</p>
<p>It will culminate in an art exhibition and interdisciplinary conversation titled &#8220;Beyond the End of the World: Approaches in Contemporary Art&#8221;&#8212;addressing the topic from the perspective of the visual arts and providing a venue to connect cross-disciplinary thinking.</p>
<p>The Sawyer Seminar is funded through the Mellon Foundation&#8217;s Higher Education and Scholarship in the Humanities program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sawyer Seminars offer unique environments for scholars to pursue complex questions that universities&#8217; conventional channels of teaching and research in the arts, humanities, and social sciences may not readily accommodate,&#8221; said Eugene Tobin, a senior program officer at the Mellon Foundation. &#8220;The &#8216;Beyond the End of the World&#8217; project demonstrates UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s deep engagement with societal &#8220;grand challenges&#8221; and interest in putting forth solutions through creative, interdisciplinary inquiry.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The principal investigator for the project is UC Santa Cruz history of art and visual culture professor T.J. Demos, who is working in collaboration with history professor Matt O&#8217;Hara, associate literature professor Hunter Bivens, associate anthropology professor Mayanthi Fernando, and associate sociology professor Deborah Gould.</p>
<p>The project team will spend 2018-19 planning and developing the program, with programming activities set to take place in 2019-20.</p>
<p>&#8220;End-of-world narratives are omnipresent these days, not surprising given the dystopian political situation, endless wars, and threatening climate catastrophe,&#8221; said Demos. &#8220;But what comes next?&#8221;&#160; &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This major research and exhibition project will turn to experimental artists, political theorists, and activists in order to ask where can we glimpse visions of liberated futurity today, and how can we cultivate justice and equality in these apparent end-times?&#8221;</p>
<p>Demos is director of the Center for Creative Ecologies which studies the intersection of culture and environment. It is a research-based forum at UC Santa Cruz aimed at developing useful interdisciplinary research tools to critically address and creatively negotiate environmental concerns in the local, regional, and global field.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sawyer Seminar offers a unique opportunity to gather leading artistic and scholarly voices from the diverse contexts of African-American and Indigenous studies, Global South environmental humanities, political ecology and anti-capitalist activism in order to consider ways to decolonize our future,&#8221; Demos noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emancipatory creativity and intersectionalist thinking, in alliance with sciences for the people, are more urgent than ever at this time when we're headed down the path of self-assured destruction,&#8221; Demos added. &#8220;Throughout the course of the seminar, we'll be asking, how can we not only envision a liberated coming world, but work together toward its realization?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mellon Foundation grant will be administered by <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#home"><strong><em>The Humanities Institute </em></strong></a>(THI) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sawyer Seminar theme connects to the larger mission of The Humanities Institute, which is to expand the impact and public engagement of the humanities,&#8221; said THI managing director Irena Polic. &#8220;In the 2019-20 academic year, the THI&#8217;s theme will be <em>Future(s)</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Humanities Institute is committed to supporting humanities scholarship across the university, and we are proud of our track record in helping faculty in other divisions to compete successfully for major grants,&#8221; added THI director and professor of history, Nathaniel Deutsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has been particularly important in cultivating new humanities research, graduate education, and programming on our campus, and we look forward to working with them into the future,&#8221; Deutsch noted.</p>

The old course evaluation system has been retired, and has been replaced with a new platform called What*Do*You*Think? (WDYT). In addition to supporting end-of-term course surveys, the new system offers more ongoing and active ways for instructors to collect feedback from students.</p>
<p>Along with the change in platform comes an important change in nomenclature. Course evaluations are now called &#8220;SETs&#8221; (Student Experience of Teaching surveys). Numerous studies have shown that the results of these surveys have little relation to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191491X16300323">whether students learned</a> anything in a course, rendering them questionable tools for genuinely &#8220;evaluating&#8221; the quality of instruction. If students are not learning, but the instructor gets excellent evaluations, what exactly is being evaluated? Indeed, a recent tongue-in-cheek experiment showed that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/medu.13627#.W77ZwOVbpA4.email">giving students cookies</a> in class produced significantly higher teaching &#8220;evaluations&#8221; than a cookie-less classroom, absent any other changes in instruction or course design.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, instructors want to hear about how students experience the design and delivery of their courses. This feedback is an important resource that can help instructors improve their teaching, as well as promote student learning and engagement. Beginning later this year, WDYT will offer the opportunity to elicit up-to-date, timely, and useful feedback from students about their experience in a course, by making it possible to use simple instructor-generated surveys throughout the quarter or to add customized questions to the end-of-quarter departmental SET. The responses to these customized questions remain confidential to the instructor, and do not appear in the instructor&#8217;s personnel review file&#8212;a feature that makes WDYT a low-risk avenue for instructors wanting to hear from their students about how they think the course is going and make adjustments while the course is still underway, or before teaching the same course again.</p>
<p>The move toward &#8220;formative&#8221; feedback reflects a widespread effort in colleges and universities in the United States to make student feedback more immediate and more course- or even lesson-specific. At the same time, instructor-generated SETs can be used to ask students to reflect on their own learning in the course&#8212;a practice known as &#8220;metacognition,&#8221; that is linked with <a href="https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/46038/the-role-of-metacognition-in-learning-and-achievement">improved learning</a>. By collecting real-time feedback and by helping students to take an active role in their own learning, well-crafted surveys delivered at key points in the term can play a part in improving the educational experience at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Later this year, once the campus has had a chance to get used to the new platform, the Academic Senate Committee on Teaching will be leading a pilot in which participating instructors will use and assess a set of alternative questions to those currently being used by most departments, to see if they correlate better with student learning.</p>
<p>The campus&#8217;s new approach to student feedback is part of an effort to address other known challenges with the traditional use of SETs. On the one hand, low return rates mean that instructors are only receiving feedback from a small portion of their students, and are reviewed in the academic personnel process using evidence from only a fraction of total class enrollment. On the other, numerous experiments have shown that SETs reflect deep bias and significantly disadvantage <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/01/11/new-analysis-offers-more-evidence-against-student-evaluations-teaching">women faculty</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25595863?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">faculty of color</a>.</p>
<p>SETs will continue to be considered in instructors&#8217; academic personnel reviews, alongside other measures that document teaching effectiveness. The <a href="http://citl.ucsc.edu">Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning</a> has worked over the past two years with the Academic Senate to <a href="http://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/documenting-teaching/">create resources</a> to guide instructors on assembling other forms of evidence that supplement the SETs.</p>
<p>Instructors can do their part in raising return rates and making these surveys more useful by reminding students of the importance faculty place on knowing how students are responding to the course and instruction, informing students about the role of SETs in the personnel process, and educating students about the presence of bias in SET survey responses.</p>
<p>A public information session and workshop will be held at 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 7 at the Stevenson Event Center for all instructors (faculty, GSIs, and TAs) who want to learn more about WDYT and the campus&#8217;s evolving approach to the role of student feedback in efforts to support outstanding teaching and learning at UCSC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8d96cdf4807270172739340f49997fd8"><name>fieldwork-workshop</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Creating a culture shift in fieldwork</title><summary>A workshop designed by a UC Santa Cruz professor and Ph.D. student aims to help scientists learn how to prevent and deal with sexual assault and harassment in field settings, where researchers often work in harsh conditions and close quarters miles from help.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Willenbring was a 22-year-old graduate student working in a remote valley in Antarctica when, she said, her supervisor, well-known Boston University geologist David Marchant, began harassing her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to details reported in 2017 in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Higher Ed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> magazines, Marchant allegedly directed sexual slurs at Willenbring, shoved her down a steep slope, pelted her with rocks while she urinated near the primitive campsite, and urged her to have sex with his brother, who was on the trip. Still, it took Willenbring 17 years before she reported the 1999 incidents. By then, she was a tenured associate professor of geology at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a 13-month investigation, Boston University said it found enough evidence to support Willenbring&#8217;s sexual harassment claims&#8212;although not the physical assaults&#8212;which, it said, warranted Marchant&#8217;s removal from the faculty. Marchant, who is appealing the decision, is on paid administrative leave, according to reports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what happened to Willenbring in the far-flung reaches of Antarctica is not an isolated incident. A 2014 nationwide study of 666 scientists by Kathryn Clancy of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign found 65 percent of those responding had been sexually harassed while working at field sites, and 21 percent said they&#8217;d experienced sexual assault. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Erika Zavaleta and Ph.D. student in ecology and evolutionary biology Melissa Cronin are pioneering an effort to change those statistics. Funded by a grant from the Henry David Thoreau Foundation, Zavaleta and Cronin are developing a workshop designed to help scientists learn how to prevent and deal with sexual assault and harassment in field settings where researchers often work in harsh conditions and close quarters miles from help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a culture shift,&#8221; Zavaleta said during a recent pilot presentation of the workshop. </span></p>
<h3>A workshop is born</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting in her sunlit office, Zavaleta, who studies climate change ecology, told stories of her own harassment while working in what should have been dream assignments. One professor repeatedly made comments about her appearance during a field expedition, while at a second site, a remote mountain camp, Zavaleta became the target of a 50-year-old supervisor who aggressively pushed to have a relationship with her. Things got so bad, the then-19-year-old Zavaleta was forced to hike alone for 25 miles to get to another station where the man didn&#8217;t work, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn&#8217;t until two years ago, while Zavaleta was having lunch with about 25 scientists at a Women in Science meeting, when talk turned to the challenges women face in the field and the idea for a workshop was born. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Suddenly two-thirds of the room were sharing the general outlines of the negative experiences they had in the field,&#8221; Zavaleta said, remembering the lunch. &#8220;I walked out of there saying, &#8216;Wow, we need to talk more about this, and, on another level, we need to address this from a practical standpoint.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>A unique set of problems</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that harassment occurs in academia shouldn&#8217;t be surprising, but doing science in the field&#8212;in remote deserts, on distant glaciers, and even aboard research ships&#8212;has its own set of problems, according to Zavaleta and Cronin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication to the outside world may be difficult, and a quick escape could be impossible. People also are working in tight quarters and doing hard work in tough conditions where they have to rely on each other for survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Field work is very hierarchical, with trainees dependent on faculty,&#8221; Cronin said. &#8220;We work long hours in close quarters with blurry boundaries of professionalism. There are also power asymmetries, and victims may fear reporting the gatekeepers&#8221; because of the possibility of professional retaliation in their budding careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The consequences and responses look very different (in the field) than at an office where there is a Title IX office at your disposal,&#8221; Cronin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while both Cronin and Zavaleta stressed that field work is not only exciting but also rewarding, they say it&#8217;s important to know how to deal with situations that may arise in the same way that it&#8217;s good to know what to do in a lightning storm or when faced with, say, a rattlesnake. </span></p>
<h3>Practical ways to make change</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair&#8217;s 90-minute workshop, which Zavaleta will present at the Student Conference for Conservation Science in New York and also will be offered to science students, faculty, and staff at UC Santa Cruz, is practical and designed to promote discussion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It not only offers definitions of harassment but also highlights the need to have clearly defined rules and codes of conduct before the group even leaves for the research site. It also covers basic safety practices and actions witnesses and bystanders can take. For instance, it stresses that the group&#8217;s satellite phone and car keys should be located where everyone&#8212;not just the supervisor&#8212;can get to them, and lists ways a bystander can stop harassment without escalating a situation. Hypothetical situations are offered so participants can figure out how to handle harassment and assault situations on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sexual harassment in the field can get in the way of people&#8217;s success, but we want to change that,&#8221; Zavaleta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Lay, curator of the UC Santa Cruz Ken Norris Center for Natural History and who currently leads the campus&#8217;s renowned, 10-week Natural History Field Quarter classes, knows the importance of this topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the group of 25 to 30 students, staff, and faculty head into places like the Mojave Desert or the Channel Islands, Lay said, he sits down with the group and has a conversation about expectations, roles, and appropriate behavior, including a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy for sexual assault and sexual harassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lay, who helped create the UC system&#8217;s Field Operations Safety Manual, said setting up expectations and giving students, staff, and faculty a framework for dealing with and reporting incidents that may occur helps create a professional and safe learning and work environment for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the training (we do before we go into the field) we can really create these magical, memorable experiences that change people&#8212;sometimes forever&#8212;and create solid networks of friends students can have for the rest of their lives,&#8221; Lay said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Dean of Physical and Biological Sciences Paul Koch agreed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fieldwork, he said, is a powerful way for students to apply what they learned in the lab and in classrooms and boosts their success in the sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;During my time as dean, it&#8217;s been my goal to increase fieldwork opportunities for students of all backgrounds. These key experiences must be safe and supportive learning environments&#8212;no matter how far from campus or remote the location,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Erika Zavaleta&#8217;s workshop is one important way we can help educate students, staff, and faculty about the risks of harassment, and provide the tools to help them preemptively identify issues and properly deal with inappropriate behavior, should it arise.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8e9b77fd807270172739340fb02c1b3a"><name>lanier-ethics-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Visionary tech pioneer Jaron Lanier to deliver Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture </title><summary>Computer scientist, composer, visual artist, and acclaimed author Jaron Lanier will deliver the 2018 Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture on Monday, October 29, at the Music Center Recital Hall.

<p>Lanier will speak on the topic, &#8220;How the Internet Failed and How to Recreate It.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pioneer in virtual reality (a term he coined), Lanier has been on the cutting-edge of technological innovation from its infancy to the present. The founder of VPL Research, the first company to sell VR products, Lanier has led teams creating VR applications for medicine, design, and numerous other fields. Lanier introduced avatars, multiperson virtual world experiences, and prototypes of major VR applications such as surgical simulation. <br/><br/>He is also the author of the international bestsellers <em>You Are Not A Gadget</em> and <em>Who Owns the Future?</em>, as well as <em>Dawn of the New Everything</em>, which was named a 2017 Best Book of the Year by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, and <em>Vox</em>.<br/><br/>Lanier&#8217;s latest book is <em>Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now</em>, which outlines how the benefits of social media can&#8217;t possibly offset the devastating losses to our personal freedom, dignity, happiness, and well-being. But Lanier also optimistically envisions a new humanistic type of social networking that can lead to a better way to live and connect to the world.<br/><br/>A founding contributing editor of <em>Wired Magazine</em>, Lanier has also written for such publications as <em>Discover, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Harpers Magazine, Atlantic</em>, and <em>Scientific American</em>. He has been interviewed on a number of television shows including <em>PBS NewsHour, The Colbert Report, Nightline</em>, and <em>Charlie Rose</em>, and has been profiled multiple times on the front pages of T<em>he New York Times</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em><br/><br/>Often described as a Renaissance Man for the 21st century, Lanier is also a musician, artist, and composer of chamber and orchestral works. Active in the world of new classical music since the late 1970&#8217;s, he has performed with such diverse musicians as Philip Glass, Yoko Ono, Ornette Coleman, George Clinton, and Steve Reich. <br/><br/>Lanier also composes and performs for film soundtracks and his credits include composer on Sean Penn&#8217;s 2010 documentary, <em>The Third Wave</em>, and principal instrumental performer for Richard Horowitz&#8217;s score for <em>Three Seasons</em> (1999), which won the Audience and Grand Jury awards at Sundance.<br/><br/>A specialist in unusual and historical musical instruments, Lanier additionally maintains one of the largest and most varied collections of actively played instruments in the world. And his paintings and drawings have been exhibited in museums and galleries in both the United States and Europe.<br/><br/><strong>Lanier&#8217;s appearance kicks off a year of programming</strong> about &#8220;Data and Democracy&#8221; by <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/#slide1"><em><strong>The Humanities Institute</strong></em></a> at UC Santa Cruz. THI director Nathaniel Deutsch noted that the institute will be hosting numerous events and other activities centered around this timely theme.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;As our society navigates shifting definitions of fake news, targeted ad programs, and compromised voting systems, it is essential that we work to understand the complex and often obscured relationship between&#160;data and democracy,&#8221; said Deutsch. <br/><br/>&#8220;During the 2018-2019 academic year, The Humanities Institute will lead a community-wide conversation about this topic through a range of events focused on the ethics of social media, online privacy, big data, and algorithmic bias.&#8221;<br/><br/>THI managing director Irena Polic added, &#8220;The humanities are essential in helping us make sense of this changing world. Let us consider what it means to be human as technologies advance and transform the world around us.&#8221;<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Jaron Lanier will give the 2018 Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture on Monday, October 29, at 7 p.m., in the Music Center Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus.

I took <span>some friends of mine who are blind down there and tried to get them get lost,&#8221; says Roberto Manduchi, professor of computer science and engineering in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p>Finding their way out of the subterranean maze of humming machines and convoluted corridors beneath the engineering building would ordinarily be a nightmare for <span>many people with visual impairment, but Manduchi&#8217;s 12 participants weren&#8217;t lost for long. They were each equipped with an app-based system that used an iPhone&#8217;s inertial sensors to guide them back. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tracking your way back is very important when you&#8217;re blind,&#8221; Manduchi said. &#8220;Imagine you were blind and wanted to see my office, and someone met you at the entrance and took you there, but wasn&#8217;t around to take you back. This system would have tracked you from point A to point B and could help guide you back again.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The backtracking system was developed by a graduate student in Manduchi's <span><a href="https://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/home">Computer Vision Lab</a>, Germ&#225;n Flores, who earned his Ph.D. in 2017 and is currently at IBM's Almaden Research Center. A new $1.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health is now funding Manduchi's ongoing work to develop the system into an iPhone app that will support both path backtracking and map-based wayfinding. </span></p>
<p>Manduchi explained that navigation apps like Waze or Google Maps, which use the Global Positioning System (GPS), don&#8217;t work well indoors. Indoor environments also tend to be much more crowded, making navigation more complicated than it is outdoors (imagine the layout of a crowded airport terminal or shopping mall).</p>
<p>&#8220;Smartphones nowadays have a lot of sensors&#8212;accelerometers, gyros, magnetometers&#8212;to do things like step counting, so you can tell what direction you&#8217;re walking in, or when you&#8217;re making a turn. Put all this information together with a little artificial intelligence and you have the phone effectively tracking your location, especially if you have a map,&#8221; Manduchi said.</p>
<p>Using an iPhone&#8217;s inertial sensors for wayfinding makes the system more convenient than other smartphone-based assistive technologies that rely on a video-feed from a phone&#8217;s camera. Using the camera requires the user to hold the phone up, whereas with Manduchi&#8217;s system, the phone can be kept in the user&#8217;s pocket.</p>
<p>Manduchi and Flores presented their initial findings on the backtracking system in April at the 2018 ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Montreal. Flores was also instrumental in another major assistive technology project that Manduchi is working on, together with engineering professors <span>Ethan Miller and Sri Kurniawan, to make public transit services more accessible.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make buses, trains, and other vehicles much more accessible to the blind,&#8221; Manduchi said.</p>
<p>Called <span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/09/public-transit-service.html">RouteMe2</a>, the system involves a smartphone app, as well as a cloud-based computer network, physical infrastructure, and beacons deployed in transit vehicles to help identify them as they approach the user. With funding from the National Science Foundation, Manduchi is partnering with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority and IBM Research on the project. </span></p>
<p>Closer to home, much of Manduchi&#8217;s other work focuses on information access for people with low vision or who have mobility issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a student with a serious disability&#8212;cerebral palsy. He<span> has poor motion control and his speech is difficult to understand, but he&#8217;s super smart and able to type using a camera focused on his head and moving the cursor that way," Manduchi said. &#8220;We want to create a system that would use AI computer vision to facilitate this communication, because the faster he can type, the better he can communicate.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Manduchi is beginning user studies with Dr. S<span>usana Chung at UC Berkeley&#8217;s School of Optometry that could help this student and others with similar mobility issues. They&#8217;re testing a system that uses the reflected glint of an infrared beam in a user&#8217;s eyes to track where someone is looking on a screen. By tracking a user&#8217;s gaze and moving a cursor along in response, the system could allow someone to rapidly scan through highly magnified type. </span></p>
<p>As with most of Manduchi&#8217;s projects, he considers cost as a crucial component of accessibility. His goal is to eventually do away with the $3,000 infrared tracking system and use the computer&#8217;s built-in camera. The researchers <span>had initial seed funding for the project from the Research to Prevent Blindness/Reader&#8217;s Digest Partners for Sight Foundation, but are still looking for more support.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The beauty of a smartphone or a computer is that it&#8217;s the same tool sighted people use,&#8221; Manduchi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an ugly assistive device that looks weird. With the same iPhone everyone else uses, a blind individual can go online or on Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manduchi, who joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2001, said the campus has been tremendously supportive of his focus on disabilities and accessibility. He teaches a course on &#8220;Universal Access: Disability, Technology and Society,&#8221; a general education class that reaches into realms beyond the technological aspects of accessibility, as is typical of Manduchi's approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be very interested in seeing how these new technologies that are integrated into apps could be used for accessibility in developing countries where traditionally people with disabilities are left behind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s my next big move, not pure technology, but more of a global health issue.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9d0ac15e807270172739340f982e0aa7"><name>strike-stay-informed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Stay informed during strike</title><summary>As previously shared, the University of California has been informed that there will be a labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers beginning at 4 a.m. on Oct. 23 and ending at 3:59 a.m. on Oct. 26. </summary><start-date>1540191600000</start-date><display-name>Stay informed during strike</display-name><path>/2018/10/strike-stay-informed</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/strike-stay-informed</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1540233018621</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1540233018621</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/strike-notice.html">previously shared</a>, the University of California has been informed that there will be a labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers beginning at 4 a.m. on Oct. 23 and ending at 3:59 a.m. on Oct. 26. </span></p>

<p>It is equally important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules. For example, UC policy does not allow free expression to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, to significantly infringe on the rights of others, or to block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings. When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, you can look especially at sections 30, 40, and 102 of the <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/index.html">Student Policies and Regulations Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>Though we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus, we are working to do everything we can to meet your basic needs through what could be a disruptive time.</p>
<p>To ensure that student residents with meal plans have food on these days of potential action, meal accommodations have been pre-arranged for pick-up from the dining facilities and will be available if we are unable to provide full meal services.</p>
<p>We also anticipate that the Student Health Services will be open during the strike, but will have limited services. The health center has recommended that students proactively take care of any immediate health care needs. In the event that a student needs immediate access to telephone crisis assessment, please direct UCSC students to call (831) 459-2628, and select option &#8220;3&#8221; (talk to counselor) on the automated menu. The student will be connected to a crisis counselor who can provide immediate consultation and support by phone.</p>
<p>Real-time updates about the strike and campus operations will be posted at <a href="https://ucsc.edu/advisory">ucsc.edu/advisory</a> beginning early Tuesday, Oct. 23.</p>

<p><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br/>Employees may use vacation, accrued compensatory time off (CTO), or leave without pay (LWOP) for the curtailment days, scheduled for December 26, 27 and 28, 2018. For employees who may not have sufficient accumulated vacation hours, up to three (3) days of vacation leave may be used in advance of actual accrual during the campus curtailment period. In addition, those employees who are normally required to wait six (6) months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their accrued vacation hours even if the required waiting period has not been completed. <br/><br/>Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during campus curtailment.<br/><br/>Units planning to maintain operations as usual during the campus curtailment period must receive approval from their respective principal officer or designee and should refer to the "Exceptions to Campus Closure" memo that will be forthcoming from Physical Plant. This memo will explain the required procedure to ensure that heat is supplied to appropriate working areas. It is important to note, however, that building temperatures in underutilized areas will generally be reduced. Therefore, please advise staff to dress appropriately during this time. <br/><br/>The 12/26/18 pay date occurs during the winter campus curtailment period when there is no campus mail service and most departments are closed.<br/><br/>Enrolling in payroll direct deposit through &#8220;UC At Your Service Online&#8221; is the best way to avoid delays in receiving your pay.&#160; Enroll by Tuesday, 12/4/18, to ensure your payroll payment is deposited in your bank account on Wednesday morning, 12/26/18. <br/><br/>Biweekly employees not enrolled in Direct Deposit can pick up their 12/26/18 paychecks at The Scotts Valley Center, located at 100 Enterprise Way, from 9am - 10am on Wednesday, 12/26/18. A valid picture ID must be presented when picking up the paycheck. Paychecks not picked up on 12/26/18 will be delivered to the campus unit designated as the employee&#8217;s mail stop in the Payroll Personnel System no later than Thursday, 1/3/19. Checks will generally not be available for pick-up on 1/2/19 because they will be in transit to Mail Services for delivery processing.<br/><br/>Information on Direct Deposit, including directions on how to enroll, is <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Payroll_Direct_Deposit.aspx">available online</a>.&#160;<br/><br/>Frequently asked questions regarding the campus curtailment and time reporting for staff employees may be <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/procedures/curtailment/winter-curtailment-faq-2018-2019.pdf">read online</a>.<br/><br/>Questions concerning academic employees should be directed to your <a href="https://apo.ucsc.edu/contacts/index.html">divisional academic personnel coordinator.</a><br/><br/>For questions regarding staff employees, please contact your appropriate <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html">Staff HR Timekeeper</a>.&#160; &#160;&#160;<br/><br/>NOTE: The effects of winter curtailment for exclusively represented employees are subject to collective bargaining.<br/><br/>-----------<br/><br/>Gerentes de unidad: se les solicita publicar una copia impresa de este mensaje para todos aquellos empleados que regularmente no tienen acceso a una computadora.<br/><br/>El receso de invierno del campus durante el periodo 2018-2019 est&#225; programado desde el s&#225;bado, 22 de diciembre del 2018 hasta el martes, 1 de enero del 2019:<br/> &#8226; Los d&#237;as 24, 25 y 31 de diciembre del 2018 y el 1 de enero del 2019 son d&#237;as de descanso pagados en la universidad (si se cumplen los criterios de elegibilidad).&#160;&#8232;<br/> &#8226; El 26, 27 y 28 de diciembre del 2018 son d&#237;as de receso.&#8232;<br/>Para estos d&#237;as de receso, los empleados pueden solicitar vacaciones, utilizar tiempo libre compensatorio acumulado (CTO) o tomarlos como permiso sin sueldo (LWOP).

</div></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>First attempt in California to restore native oysters through aquaculture is led by Kerstin Wasson, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">On October 23, 2018, a new generation of Olympia oysters will settle into their home on the tidal mudflats of the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. These oyster babies were raised at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories&#8217; new Aquaculture Facility, with a grant from the Anthropocene Institute and support from California Sea Grant. This effort represents the first attempt to support native oyster restoration through aquaculture in the state of California.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Why were these juvenile oysters raised in the lab? Elkhorn Slough Reserve&#8217;s Research Coordinator Kerstin Wasson, who has been tracking natural recruitment of oysters in the estuary for the past decade, explained, &#8220;In all the years I&#8217;ve been monitoring, we only had a good crop of new juveniles appear twice, once in 2007 and once in 2012.&#8221; With the last successful event going back six years, Elkhorn Slough&#8217;s native oyster population is at real risk of disappearing entirely. Native American middens and paleo-ecological data reveal oysters have lived in the estuary for ten thousand years. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">I don&#8217;t want to lose them on my watch,&#8221; said Wasson, an adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">For the past decade, the Elkhorn Slough Reserve and Elkhorn Slough Foundation have been committed to conservation of the native Olympia oyster in Elkhorn Slough. Their goal is to ensure that this iconic bivalve thrives in this estuary as a legacy for future generations. In 2012, Wasson, along with Elkhorn Slough Reserve Biologist Susie Fork and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center&#8217;s Chela Zabin, deployed hundreds of clam shell reefs to provide habitat to native oysters, which need hard substrate that prevents them from being buried in the mud. That was a good settlement year, and the reefs soon supported thousands of new oysters. Since then, however, virtually no new recruits have appeared on these reefs or anywhere in the estuary.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The exact cause of the oysters&#8217; reproductive failure is unknown. Wasson conducted a comparative study of oyster recruitment, published in the journal&#160;</span></span></span></span><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;"><i>Ecology</i></span></span></span></span><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">, collaborating with researchers along 2500 km (1,553 miles) of coastline. They found that estuaries with high failure rates tended to have especially small remaining oyster populations and strong marine influence, which can result in cold waters and larvae being swept out to sea rather than retained in the bay. The artificial mouth to Elkhorn Slough built in the 1940s to support Moss Landing Harbor has substantially increased marine influence to the estuary.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">No matter what the cause, one clear solution was to raise native oyster spat in a hatchery, the way commercially grown, non-native oysters are produced all along this coast because waters are generally too cold for natural reproduction. Fortuitously, the timing was right: Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) was just in the process of developing aquaculture capability. Wasson and her former student Brent Hughes, who earned his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz and is now a professor at Sonoma State University, received a grant from the Anthropocene Institute to fund the aquaculture project. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Part of this project is all about rescuing oysters, but also to place them in different areas where we can learn about their species interactions and possibly new areas for restoration,&#8221; Hughes said.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Led by Michael Graham, Scott Hamilton, and Luke Gardner, a team of students, staff, and researchers at MLML worked together to develop aquaculture techniques. Adult oysters were taken through a temperature regimen involving a steady increase of water temperature over a couple of weeks to stimulate sperm release necessary for egg fertilization. After larvae release from the female oysters, free swimming larvae were moved to separate rearing tanks until they were large enough, with eyespots and a mobile foot, to begin settling on native gaper clam shells as a settlement surface. Then followed months of laborious feeding with cultured microscopic algae.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">&#8220;</span></span><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Raising oysters is a finicky business but we got them through,&#8221; said Luke Gardner, a California Sea Grant aquaculture specialist and MLML research faculty member.&#160;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Finally, about 2,500 fresh oyster recruits are ready for the real world &#8212; a number that represents about 10 times the number of live oysters in the part of the Elkhorn Slough Reserve where they will be transplanted.</span></span></span></span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three leading UC Santa Cruz alumni journalists talked about the challenge of doing their jobs when newsrooms keep shrinking and politicians in the highest echelons of power keep labeling them &#8220;enemies of the people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This onstage discussion was one of the highlights of the Founders Celebration Dinner, held at Porter College on Saturday. The night was a time to recognize excellence and service to the community, with honorees including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiat Lux Award recipient </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-laird-john.html"><strong>John Laird</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Stevenson &#8217;72, politics), a trailblazing public servant. Laird, first elected to the Santa Cruz City Council in 1981, went on to be one of the first openly gay mayors in the country. A former state Assemblyman, he was appointed California Secretary for Natural Resources by Governor Jerry Brown in 2011; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty Research Award recipient </span><strong>Lise Getoor</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC Santa Cruz and founding director of the UC Santa Cruz Data, Discovery, and Decisions (D3) Data Research Center; and </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Achievement Award honoree </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/batalha-alumni-award.html"><strong>Natalie Batalha</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ph.D. &#8217;97, astrophysics), astrophysicist and lead scientist on the NASA Kepler Mission. In 2015, she joined the leadership team of a new NASA initiative dedicated to the search for evidence of life beyond the solar system. NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) brings teams from multiple disciplines together to understand the diversity of worlds. Kepler has demonstrated that Earth-size planets abound in the galaxy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During their lively onstage discussion,</span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/year-of-alumni-mendoza-martha.html"><strong>Martha Mendoza</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kresge &#8217;88, journalism and education) Associated Press correspondent and a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner; </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/09/kahn-carrie.html"><strong>Carrie Kahn</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (College Eight/Rachel Carson &#8217;87, biology), NPR international correspondent based in Mexico City, covering Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><strong> Mike McPhate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kresge &#8217;00, anthropology major/journalism minor), founder of the California Sun, a daily e-newsletter that curates general-interest news about California, regaled the audience with their tales from the field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendoza spoke about getting yelled at by Trump supporters at rallies, while waiting in vain for a chance to express common cause with attendees&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;m a mom, you&#8217;re a mom. You live here, I live here. We both want clean water.&#8221; McPhate mentioned the nasty emails he often receives, just because he happens to live in and write about California. He also said that there are now half the number of journalists working in California as there were 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a journalist in 2018&#8212;we are a dying breed,&#8221; Kahn said. &#8220;NPR has very few outlets left in the world. Wire services are slowly closing. I&#8217;ve been in Mexico City the last few years. I&#8217;ve seen friends take buyouts or get laid off and been replaced by freelancers.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also mentioned a group of journalist drinking buddies that gets smaller and smaller. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is a difficult time for journalists,&#8221; she said.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these three influential reporters showed no signs of cynicism or exhaustion, in spite of blowback from members of the public who heap scorn on even the most prestigious media outlets, and questionable outlets that conflate opinion and editorials with genuine reporting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I can sound an optimistic note, there is a ton of energy, optimism, and entrepreneurship going on,&#8221; McPhate said, mentioning the success and influence of nonpartisan, nonprofit member-supported news organizations such as Calmatters.org. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think people are ever going to stop being interested in stories,&#8217;&#8217; McPhate continued. &#8220;People aren&#8217;t reading less than they used to. Demand is always going to be there. It&#8217;s a matter of fixing the business side.&#8221; </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the three panelists understand the value and impact of on-the-ground journalism. Mendoza shared her experiences reporting and writing </span><a href="https://apnews.com/97b06cede0c149c492bf25a48cb6c26f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a hard-hitting story, with Garance Burke, about deported parents losing their kids to adoption.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She said UC Santa Cruz helped prepare her for the wrenching experience &#8220;of going to El Salvador and asking a mom what it was like to have her daughter taken away. (UC Santa Cruz) gets people out of their comfort zone, talking to people in homeless centers, in jails. I don&#8217;t think you can get through this university without talking to people you aren&#8217;t comfortable with.&#8221;</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This immersive reporting is a far cry from what goes on in many news outlets, &#8220;which just compile the news,&#8217;&#8217; Kahn said. &#8220;Someone just reports what another (news source) said, and no one is on the ground.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this open spirit of dialogue, Mendoza warmly acknowledged a group of student protesters who had gathered outside the Founders celebration. The protesters argued that UC Santa Cruz is charging exorbitant tuition while too many underfunded students are without stable housing, textbooks, and other essential needs. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mendoza also remarked on her beginnings at UC Santa Cruz, when she took Conn Hallinan&#8217;s journalism class and found a focus and outlet for her political awakenings. Mendoza went right to work in a newsroom immediately after graduating from college.&#160; <br/></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another emotional highlight of the evening was the acceptance speech of Alumni Achievement honoree Natalie Batalha, who spoke of raising a small child on campus while taking on a full workload of classes. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She said the Astronomy Department not only accepted her but also championed her for being a mother and a student. She recalled Chancellor George Blumenthal&#8212;during his tenure as an astrophysics professor, and long before he took office as UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 10th chancellor&#8212;checking up on her after the devastating 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and bringing her diapers for her baby when she was living in family student housing. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was that kindness, that sense of community that really marked me during the time,&#8221; Batalha said.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She also remembered bundling up her small children to see the comet Hyakutake as it soared across the night sky in the spring of 1996. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I took them to the top of the Great Meadow to meet with some fellow grad students,&#8221; she recalled. One of her young daughters looked into the sky and pointed and said, &#8220;What is that?&#8217; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She had seen the comet before I&#8217;d even told her what we were going to do, and demanded to know what it was,&#8221; Batalha told the crowd. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This small child&#8217;s question turned out to be the beginning of an impressive academic career. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Twenty-two years after seeing that comet in the sky, that little girl returned this year as a postdoctoral fellow in the Astronomy Department,&#8221; said Batalha, drawing roars of approval from the crowd. She was referring to her daughter, </span><a href="https://natashabatalha.github.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natasha Batalha,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is working with the planetary scientist Jonathan Fortney, a professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and director of the Other Worlds Laboratory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Laird, Fiat Lux recipient, also got an enthusiastic response when he mentioned that it was &#8220;50 years ago last month when I arrived at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221; He said that if anyone had told him he would be standing up on stage one day, receiving an award for outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the university, &#8220;I would have been surprised. I struggled at the beginning. I learned how to write, analyze, and think&#8212;not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to think, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to think.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that hard work and problem-solving paid off. Laird labored over an honors thesis on the history of water development in California. Now he&#8217;s just wrapped up eight years as the government&#8217;s point person on water policy in California. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in the evening Chancellor Blumenthal&#8212;who recently announced his plans for retirement at the end of this coming academic year, after what will be 13 years leading the university&#8212; spoke with pride about improved town-gown relations, and for the strides the campus has made, &#8220;staking a claim to excellence, advancing diversity, and encouraging philanthropy.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Blumenthal also had a role of bringing the Founders Celebration to campus after attending a similar event at UC San Francisco. &#8220;They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery,&#8221; he noted. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emcee for the evening was Cynthia Chase (Merrill &#8217;01, psychology), the inmate programs manager at the Santa Cruz County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, former director of the nonprofit Gemma program for formerly incarcerated individuals, and former mayor of Santa Cruz. She noted the large number of influential alumni in the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can&#8217;t swing a Banana Slug in here without hitting a former mayor,&#8221; she observed. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a71ac343807270172739340f7cfcd13b"><name>moschkovich-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Moschkovich named 2019 distinguished scholar   </title><summary>Judit Moschkovich, professor of mathematics education, has been selected to receive the 2019 Distinguished Scholar Award from the Special Interest Group for Research in Mathematics Education.</summary><start-date>1540364400000</start-date><display-name>Moschkovich-Award</display-name><path>/2018/10/moschkovich-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/moschkovich-award</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1540401839910</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1540401839910</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/moschkovich.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/moschkovich.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moschkovich.jpg</name><display-name>moschkovich.jpg</display-name><file-size>11473</file-size><width>228</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Judit Moschkovich</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/10/images/moschkovich_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/10/images/moschkovich_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moschkovich_80.jpg</name><display-name>moschkovich_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3875</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Judit Moschkovich</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Judit Moschkovich</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Judit Moschkovich, professor of mathematics education, has&#160;been selected to receive the 2019 Distinguished Scholar Award from the <a href="http://sigrme.org/">Special Interest Group for Research in Mathematics Education</a>, a subunit of the&#160;American Educational Research Association (AERA).</p>
<p>Moschkovich is the sixth scholar selected for the honor since&#160;the&#160;start of the award in 2006. The award recognizes those whose research has contributed to the theoretical development of the field of mathematics education, and who have expanded the research capacity of the field in ways that are used regularly by others. Recipients are selected by a committee of scholars in the field of mathematics education.</p>
<p>Moschkovich, who is a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/moschkovich-aera.html">2018 fellow of the AERA</a>, will receive the award and deliver an invited address to the Special Interest Group during the AERA Annual Conference in April.</p>
<p>&#160;In the award letter, the selection committee noted Moschkovich's influence on a broad range of researchers and practitioners over three decades and her "major impact on the intersection of discourse and mathematics learning, including investigations of mathematics discourse involving non-dominant populations of students as well as challenging deficit views towards bilingual mathematics learners."</p>
<p>The AERA is the largest national interdisciplinary research association devoted to the scientific study of education and learning.</p>

We also will share major status updates via CruzAlert and through our 459-INFO phone line.<br/><br/>Today&#8217;s demonstrations were peaceful for both demonstrators and those entering and exiting campus, and we appreciate your continued patience. We urge all to drive carefully and allow extra travel time in the event there&#8217;s congestion on roads around campus.<br/><br/>A reminder that campus shuttles will not be running through the duration of the labor action, though Disability Van Service is available by calling 831-459-2829. Santa Cruz Metro buses also will not come onto campus during the protests.

<p>While there are few changes this year, it is always a good idea to review the OE information and consider all of your available choices. This is the time of year to review your health and welfare benefits, assess your needs, and decide if you will make any changes. If you decide that your health and welfare benefits should remain unchanged your benefits will continue for most plans. If you want to continue participation in Health and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA), re-enrollment is required during open enrollment..</p>

<p>University of California President Janet Napolitano today announced the formation of an advisory committee of university faculty, staff, students, alumni and foundation representatives to help in the international search for a new chancellor to lead our campus. Board of Regents Chair George Kiefer also appointed five regents to serve on the committee.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal, who announced in September that he planned to retire at the end of the current academic year, will continue in the role until a new chancellor is appointed.</p>
<p>The members of the search advisory committee for the UC Santa Cruz chancellor include:</p>
<ul>
<li>UC President Janet Napolitano</li>
<li>UC Board of Regents Chair George Kieffer</li>
<li>UC Regents Darin Anderson, Devon Graves, Richard Leib, Lark Park, and Charlene Zettel</li>
<li>Robert May, chair of the systemwide Academic Senate</li>
<li>UC Santa Cruz faculty representatives Don Brenneis, professor of Anthropology; Ana Christina Ravelo, professor of Ocean Sciences, Abel Rodriguez, professor of Statistics and associate dean for Graduate Affairs at the Baskin School of Engineering</li>
<li>Janice Reiff, professor of History, Statistics &amp; Digital Humanities and special assistant to the EVC for Online Teaching &amp; Learning, UC Los Angeles</li>
<li>Ayo Banjo, undergraduate student and president, Student Union Assembly</li>
<li>Katie Hellier, vice president of shared governance, Graduate Student Association and PhD candidate, researcher &#8211; Carter Labs</li>
<li>Paul Simpson, past member UC Santa Cruz Alumni Council</li>
<li>Fiona Weigant, manager, Education Department and chair of the UC Santa Cruz staff advisory board</li>
<li>Kamil Hasan, vice chair of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>The committee's initial meeting will be held November 16 on our campus, where members and invited guests will gather in a closed session. The forum will include remarks by Napolitano, followed by separate sessions with various campus constituency groups. The president and committee members also will participate in a luncheon with alumni, donors and community leaders.</p>
<p>The advisory committee will be involved in recruiting, screening and conducting interviews with candidates for the position. The committee's work will be scheduled so that candidates can be presented to Napolitano for consideration and a recommended nominee submitted to the Board of Regents for approval, tentatively by May 2019.</p>
<p>In addition to presentations by those constituency representatives who will meet with the committee, public input is encouraged throughout the search process. Comments may be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:ucscchancellorsearch@ucop.edu">ucscchancellorsearch@ucop.edu</a>.</p>
<p>The executive search firm Isaacson, Miller will assist in the process. Submission of nominations and application materials may be sent via email to <a href="mailto:santacruzchancellor@imsearch.com">santacruzchancellor@imsearch.com</a></p>

Nathan Altice, professor of computational media in the Baskin School of Engineering, volunteered to organize a team of students to take on the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a paying project, so it was a great opportunity for the students to work with a client while they&#8217;re in school. Working with a client is completely different from working on your own project,&#8221; Altice said.</p>
<p>Specialized wanted a retro style game like the old 1980s Nintendo games, because the Stumpjumper line debuted in the early 1980s as the first mass-produced mountain bikes. This idea appealed to Altice, who studies the history of computing and games (his book <em>I Am Error</em> is a comprehensive technical and historical account of the Nintendo Entertainment System).</p>
<p>Altice selected a group of talented students who he thought would be able to handle the project on top of their regular school work, and the team spent the next six months developing the game and getting it to work as a web-based game playable on a wide range of devices.</p>
<p>Specialized released &#8220;<a href="https://media.specialized.com/stumpjumper-the-game/index.html"><span>Stumpjumper: The Video Game</span></a>&#8221; on October 11. It's a two-dimensional, lane-based racing game inspired by an old Nintendo motocross game from the 1980s called Excitebike. A storyline involves winning the big race to save the hometown trails from "Big Corporation" developers. There are stumps to avoid, ramps to jump, and coins to collect, but no particular skill is required to play the game.</p>
<p>"We wanted it to be accessible, something anybody could have fun with, so the bike goes by itself, and as a player you're mostly changing lanes and doing tricks during jumps," Altice explained.</p>
<p>Lead developer Johannes Spaulding said he was initially skeptical about taking on the project, but in the end it seemed like too good an opportunity to pass up. "The more I learned about what Specialized wanted to do, the more interesting it sounded," he said. "I liked the idea that the barrier to entry would be really low, so anyone could play it, and just knowing that lots of people would be playing our game."</p>
<p>For Spaulding, the project eventually became his senior capstone project, which he presented at the annual Sammy Showcase hosted by the UCSC Center for Games and Playable Media. "It was very encouraging to see droves of people going on their phones and playing our game," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Spaulding, who worked on all aspects of the game, the students on the team included Andrew Gwinner (programming and design), Jared Pettitt (programming, design, and concept art), Courtney Chavez (animation and concept art), and Long Nguyen (concept art and environment art). Altice did the music, sound effects, and level design for the game.</p>
<p>As producer, Altice also served as the liaison between Specialized and the student team. "They ended up being great clients," he said. "They just had to trust the process, and when we showed it to them they were thrilled. The students put a lot of care into the design and made a real professional-quality game. The feedback has been good from social media, too."</p>
<p>Spaulding said he hopes the game&#8217;s success will lead to more opportunities for students to work on industry-sponsored game projects like this. &#8220;If you give students a chance to follow their passion, they can produce a game that people will really like,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c1854ac5807270172739340ff0735df4"><name>supporting-trans-community</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supporting all transgender and gender non-conforming members of our community </title><summary>We write to condemn a recent move by the Trump administration to redefine gender under Title IX, and to reaffirm our commitment to the transgender and gender non-conforming members of our community.</summary><start-date>1540796400000</start-date><display-name>Supporting all transgender and gender non-conforming members of our community </display-name><path>/2018/10/supporting-trans-community</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/supporting-trans-community</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1540845029018</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1540845029018</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="color: #000000; font-family: -webkit-standard; line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We write to condemn a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html" style="text-decoration-line: none;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">recent move by the Trump administration</span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> to redefine gender under Title IX, and to reaffirm our commitment to the transgender and gender non-conforming members of our community. Though not policy yet, this move threatens the rights and protections afforded to transgender and gender non-conforming people in areas including health, education, and labor by imposing a definition of gender that is binary, &#8216;biological&#8217;, and immutable. It is part of a larger, systemic pattern under the current administration of eroding the rights of transgender people. Whether this latest effort succeeds or fails, those who wish to marginalize or harm the transgender population can look for legitimacy in it and feel emboldened by this new definition.</span></p>

<p>The grant, to the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu/">Educational Partnership Center</a> (EPC), will serve 1,630 underrepresented students in the Pajaro Valley beginning in their sixth and seventh grades and on through their first year of college.</p>
<p>The grant is part of the federal government&#8217;s Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, called GEAR UP, which is designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.</p>
<p>The GEAR UP funding helps advance the center&#8217;s commitment to improve high school graduation and college-enrollment and attainment rates for low-income, first-generation college students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions, said EPC executive director Maria Rocha-Ruiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am excited about the opportunities this funding will provide students in Pajaro Valley to gain a foothold on the path to college eligibility and realize their aspirations of graduating from college,&#8221; Rocha-Ruiz said. &#8220;Building upon our prior successes with GEAR UP and its impact, we are looking forward to continuing our partnership with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District to further our joint efforts on creating enduring college-going cultures for students and their families. &#8221;</p>
<p>With the grant, the Educational Partnership Center plans to:</p>
<ul>
<li>help increase students&#8217; academic performance and preparation,</li>
<li>increase the area&#8217;s high school graduation and college enrollments rates, and</li>
<li>further develop a college-going mindset and increase the knowledge of higher education, preparation, and financing among students and their families.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Today and tomorrow&#8217;s workplace inspire the district to reimagine our educational system for our students to compete in the global economy,&#8221; PVUSD Superintendent Michelle Rodriguez said. &#8220;Our partnership is crucial to ensure our students graduate college or are career-ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of its GEAR UP program, the EPC will work with partner organizations Cabrillo Community College, City of Watsonville, County of Santa Cruz, Digital NEST, Food What, MAIA Foundation, Monterey Bay Aquarium, Pajaro Valley Prevention and Student Assistance, Pajaro Valley Unified School District, Santa Cruz Community Credit Union, Santa Cruz County Office of Education, Watsonville Wetlands Watch, Your Future is Our Business, and the YWCA of Watsonville.</p>
<p>The EPC and its partners will offer services that emphasize college and career readiness and create a sustainable college-going and completion culture, work that is guided by recent research, best practices, and a unified framework of academic preparation and college and career readiness, said Rocha-Ruiz.</p>
<p>The program takes a holistic approach, offering additional information and support for students, their parents, teachers, and counselors.</p>
<p>Students will receive customized college, career, and financial aid advising; tutoring; comprehensive mentoring; services that extend and enrich the school day and year, such as summer academies; opportunities for gaining job-ready skills in high demand industry sectors; and referrals to essential college support services at their respective colleges.</p>
<p>Parent academies and the home visit program will empower families with knowledge and skills to help them support their child&#8217;s college and career aspirations.</p>
<p>Teachers will participate in professional development workshops that build knowledge and skills in literacy and language instruction to help all students excel in all academic areas and be prepared for college-level coursework.</p>
<p>Counselors and teachers will partake in professional development that build their capacity to support students&#8217; college aspirations and preparation for college and careers.</p>
<p>Collectively, these services are meant to lead to increased rates of four-year college eligibility; rigorous and advanced courses completion; high school graduation; and college enrollment and completion.</p>
<p>The EPC, a program of the UC Santa Cruz Division of Undergraduate Education, currently oversees two other GEAR UP programs: one in South Monterey County and another in the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District.</p>
<p><em>The Educational Partnership Center coordinates student academic preparation efforts of UC Santa Cruz with the goal of increasing access and opportunity to postsecondary education for students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions. Through ten vital programs (EAOP, MESA, COSMOS, Cal-SOAP, GEAR UP, SIP, GIE, Educational Talent Search, Girls Paving the Way and the California Reading and Literature Project), and with support from federal, state and foundation funding, EPC provides an array of direct services which support students on the college-going pathway through tutoring, mentoring, academic and career planning and counseling, leadership training, test preparation, college and career awareness and enrichment, and teacher professional development.</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c234bdd0807270172739340f012168c8"><name>policy-financial-interests</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New policy on disclosure of financial interests and management of conflicts of interest in private sponsors of research</title><summary>The policy applies to any research activity that is funded or supported by a non-governmental entity in whole or in part through a contract or grant; by a gift which is designated by the gift donor for a specific research project, or a specific Principal Investigator, or a laboratory or research program headed by a Principal Investigator; or through in-kind support provided under a material transfer agreement (MTA).</summary><start-date>1540796400000</start-date><display-name>UC Policy</display-name><path>/2018/10/policy-financial-interests</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/policy-financial-interests</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1540856527302</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1540856527302</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Office of the President has issued a new Presidential Policy on Disclosure of Financial Interests and Management of Conflicts of Interest in Private Sponsors of Research, effective October 23, 2018.

<p>Approximately 125 high school, undergraduate, and graduate students competed in a research poster presentation competition at the conference, which was held in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.sigmaxi.org/meetings-events/annual-meeting-and-student-research-conference">Sigma Xi Annual Meeting</a>. The vast majority of the high school students in the competition were SIP interns, according to the program's faculty director Puragra (Raja) GuhaThakurta, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"As many as 21 of the posters at the conference were led or coauthored by SIP interns, 40 of whom attended the meeting," GuhaThakurta said.</p>
<p>Five SIP interns were among the top presenters selected by judges in each division and research category. Iris Xia of Monta Vista High School in Cupertino and Justin Cai of Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose worked together on their project and were the top high school presenters in the geosciences category. A tie in the physics and astronomy category resulted in shared top honors for Arushi Sahai of Menlo School in Atherton and co-presenters Bryan Wang and Rishi Dange of the Harker School in San Jose.</p>
<p>SIP is a 10-week summer research internship program for high school students interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The students participate in existing research projects at UC Santa Cruz and receive one-on-one mentoring from UCSC faculty, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. GuhaThakurta is also a cofounder of the <a href="http://www.globalspherenetwork.org/">Global SPHERE Network</a>, which promotes programs like SIP that provide research experience for high school students.</p>
<p>Sigma Xi is one of the oldest and largest scientific organizations in the world. Sigma Xi chapters can be found at colleges and universities, government laboratories, and industry research centers around the world. Joel Primack, professor emeritus of physics at UC Santa Cruz, is the current president of Sigma Xi.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="7051dec680727017273daba4a8b5f961"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1538380800000</start-date><path>/2018/10/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/10/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1513712901812</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1513887933645</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
