</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberley Kanani Bitterwolf pulled off a brave and difficult feat at the UC Santa Cruz Grad Slam 2018 competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took a complicated and intimidating topic&#8212;namely, the isotopic composition of salts in sediment layers and how they record our planet&#8217;s climate history&#8212;and refined it down to three entertaining, easy-to-follow minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might even say that she turned salt into narrative gold, giving a fast-paced, lilting, and occasionally hilarious story about the history of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her efforts, Bitterwolf won this year&#8217;s campuswide Grad Slam, otherwise known as &#8220;the three-minute thesis challenge.&#8221; This elevator pitch competition encourages better storytelling about complex academic topics</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitors must distill years of academic research into fascinating and edifying three-minute talks to non-expert audiences. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s one thing to be a master of your own work, and quite another thing to explain it to the public. This daunting process encourages students to clarify ideas and help others understand and appreciate the significance of their research or other graduate work. The contest is open to all graduate students.</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the competition held in late February at the Music Recital Hall on campus, Bitterwolf won $3,000 and the opportunity to compete at the system-wide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Grad Slam on May 3 at LinkedIn in San Francisco. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitterwolf also took home the People&#8217;s Choice Award for an additional $750.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A community panel comprised of leaders in government and the nonprofit sector judged the event held on campus. A crowd of 145 attendees were invited to vote on their favorite presentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grad Slam has a great track record when it comes to fostering unforgettable presentations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year&#8217;s UC Santa Cruz Grad Slam </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">champion, John Felts, earned top marks for his talk about creating environmentally friendly surfboard foam from the shells of shrimp. He went on to take second place at last year&#8217;s UC Grad Slam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it were presented in an unimaginative way, Bitterwolf&#8217;s topic might cause the audience to squirm with confusion, then sink into a deep and dreamless sleep. But Bitterwolf, a fifth-year Ocean Sciences Ph.D. candidate who hails from Lihue, Kauai, and owns a Rottweiler-Husky mix named Pawesome, has a quirky sense of humor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also has an instinctive sense of what will captivate an audience and what will make them break out in fidgets. Rather than baffling the crowd with confusing terminology, Bitterwolf jumped right into the dramatic content. She mentioned, for instance, that &#8220;once Siberia was covered by mega-volcanoes&#8217;&#8217; and that the overwhelming release of particulates from those big, belching craters plunged the Earth into a nuclear winter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But the thing is, how do we know any of this?&#8217;&#8217; she asked. &#8220;How do you know</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t make that up? If you are so inclined, you could read all about it in the Earth&#8217;s underwater library! It is called sediment. The younger sediment is on the top. The older sediment is on the bottom. Here, all events in Earth&#8217;s history are written down, but not in a language you can speak. It is all done in chemistry, specifically the chemistry of salt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am not talking about boring, common table salt,&#8217;&#8217; she added, &#8220;but rare salts. Lithium. Magnesium. Calcium. Strontium. Barium. These are the five I study for my Ph.D. thesis at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be a bit more specific, she studies those five salts in the &#8220;inputs&#8221; that make the ocean salty in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you&#8217;ve ever wondered why the ocean is so eye-burningly salty, Bitterwolf has a ready explanation. That saltiness in ocean water is the result of those elements and more&#8212;sluicing into the ocean from the continent through rivers and streams, or burbling straight into the sea from artesian wells and other groundwater sources. The places where freshwater makes contact with the ocean are where Bitterwolf studies the chemistry in the water.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The second-place finisher, Nickolas Knightly, a fifth-year philosophy Ph.D. student, also wowed the judges, but with a very different kind of presentation. Leaving the visuals behind, he relied entirely on speech when he gave a presentation entitled &#8220;A Better World Depends on Better Ways of Knowing.&#8221;</span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Division of Graduate Studies couldn&#8217;t be prouder of the top two finishers, Kimberley and Nickolas, and of the fact that they had very different presentation styles and represented different academic divisions, PBSci in Kimberley&#8217;s case, Humanities in Nickolas&#8217;,&#8221; said Sonya&#160;Newlyn, program assistant for the Division of Graduate Studies. &#8220;But the staff of the Graduate Division is also justifiably proud of all the finalists, every one of whom gave strong presentations.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

public health departments in both San Francisco and Los Angeles are graduates of the program. And both women are returning to campus this spring as guest lecturers in a special-edition public health class offered by Community Studies.</p>
<p>The class features eight alumni speakers, including <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-garcia.html">Barbara Garcia</a> (Oakes College '84, community studies) and Barbara Ferrer (Rachel Carson College '78, community studies), directors of the San Francisco and Los Angeles County departments, respectively. The class is part of Community Studies&#8217; year-long 50th anniversary celebration, and guest speakers from every decade will discuss their professional paths and lecture on the subject of their expertise; topics include community health care, the opioid crisis, mental health in disaster areas, the gender revolution, and leadership development for global health.</p>
<p>Garcia credits Community Studies with validating her interest in community-engaged health care.</p>
<p>"Community Studies was a really important program for me," said Garcia. "It accepted and embraced community activism, and provided the theoretical base that supported my career."</p>
<p>Health has always been a focus of Community Studies, said course instructor Andrea Steiner. The emphasis is on "health justice," which includes analysis of the production, accessibility, and quality of health care, as well as "social determinants" of health. "Access to fresh air, good food, and housing are all determinants of health," noted Steiner.</p>
<p>Seventy students have enrolled in the class, said Steiner, who teaches the course every other year. The class meets twice weekly, with alumni participants appearing on Monday night, followed by a lecture and discussion on Wednesday afternoon.&#160;</p>
<p><em>Community engaged public health</em></p>
<p>Garcia, who was the first in her family to attend college, stayed in Santa Cruz after graduating in 1984. She helped build food and nutrition programs for farmworkers in Watsonville and was instrumental in opening a free medical clinic that would become the Salud Para la Gente Health Clinic; she was executive director until 1995, overseeing programs that serve thousands of farm worker families every year.</p>
<p>As director of the San Francisco public health department, a position she has held since 2011, Garcia administers a $2 billion budget, more than 8,000 employees, dozens of medical clinics, two hospitals, a skilled nursing facility, and hundreds of organizations that provide mental health and substance abuse services. Garcia said her work involves a "lot of the same philosophies and practices" she learned in Community Studies, particularly around community engagement.</p>
<p>"It's about collective impact and how you bring people together to maintain and improve health," she said, citing the city's Getting to Zero SF program. With a mission of reducing the transmission, death, and stigma of HIV/AIDS to zero by 2020, Getting to Zero is an example of a program that is only as strong as its many partners. "That's the vision. It's going to be a real big lift, given the disparities in access to care, but it's the vision of hundreds of people," she said.</p>
<p>Garcia said her message for undergraduates will focus on how to look at a community and, using public health concepts, identify its overall health. Garcia, who spoke at the Oakes College graduation ceremony a few years ago, said the opportunity to come back as a teacher is "part of the circle of giving back."</p>
<p>Community Studies "kept me in college," she said. "It was easy to get disillusioned, in the face of all the great needs in our community. It was an acknowledgement of the importance of community work."</p>
<p><em>Field-study experiences set graduates on their path</em></p>
<p>Community Studies majors are required to complete a six-month field study, and many students choose health-related internships. Students gain hands-on experience and skills that help them get jobs after graduation; for many, their field study experiences have a lasting impact on their career path.</p>
<p>"They have no idea how much they're going to get out of it," said Steiner, who does a lot of academic advising, too. "We spend a lot of time on preparation, and students all say the same thing: 'They had other interns, but I was treated like staff.' "</p>
<p>Alumni guest speaker Dan Cooper (Merrill College '70, community development) spent six months on a kibbutz in Israel as part of an independent major that was a precursor to Community Studies. Today, Cooper is a professor of pediatric medicine and the associate vice chancellor for clinical and translational science at UC Irvine. As the guest speaker on April 30, Cooper will discuss "Bringing Lab Science to Real World Health Care."</p>
<p>Cooper arrived at UC Santa Cruz a year after the campus opened, drawn by the ways in which it was a "departure from all the other UCs." Eager to make a contribution to society, he was already thinking about medical school and loved the independence of designing his own major.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to major in science, because I didn't think that would be taking advantage of all that was being offered," he said, recalling three "phenomenal" courses: "The History of the American Dream of Success," "Stability and Change in the USSR," and "Introduction to Genetics." "I'm better educated than 99 percent of my colleagues in medicine," he added.</p>
<p>A pediatrician who specializes in childhood lung disease, Cooper has worked in developing countries, El Salvador, and Mexico. "Santa Cruz motivated me to work at the community level," he said.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Cooper joined the faculty at UC Irvine, tasked with establishing a general clinical research center that would support the National Institutes of Health's infrastructure and "get people-oriented research done." "The community part is written in," he said. "I had that skillset from Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>About a decade ago, that initiative morphed into a Clinical Translational Science Award, dedicated to speeding up the process of moving research discoveries from the lab to the clinical setting. Cooper leads that initiative.</p>
<p>Cooper plans to talk with students about today's emphasis on "patient-centered outcomes" as an evolution of ideas he was first exposed to during college. "The emphasis on community and doing stuff for society--it's nothing new," he said. "I studied it as a student at UC Santa Cruz in 1967."&#160;</p>
<p><em>The Gender Revolution</em></p>
<p>The most recent graduate to guest lecture in Steiner's course is Jamie Joy (Stevenson College '16, community studies and feminist studies), the LGBTQ youth program coordinator for The Diversity Center in Santa Cruz, who will talk about "Improving Health through Access to Education: The Gender Revolution."</p>
<p>Today's gender expansiveness is the latest phase of a movement that has evolved over the course of many decades to give people options beyond "being forced into one of two boxes," said Joy. "Our gender identities are related to all our other identities&#8212;where we grew up, how we were raised and taught. How we identify and express our gender is complex and dynamic."</p>
<p>Community Studies was the perfect fit for Joy, who appreciated its interdisciplinary approach. "Community Studies offers opportunities to do work that's meaningful not just for your education but for your community," said Joy.</p>
<p>Joy, who uses gender neutral pronouns, was first involved in public health as a sexual health peer educator and HIV peer test counselor at UCSC. During their field-study placement at The Diversity Center, they managed two initiatives: analyzing the results of a survey of 140 LGBTQ youth in Santa Cruz County high schools, and creating a two-hour sex-education curriculum for LGBTQ youth.</p>
<p>"Santa Cruz isn't as ahead of the curve as we imagine ourselves to be," Joy said of the survey results. Many queer youth reported witnessing and experiencing bullying, and few saw themselves or the LGBTQ community represented in the high school curriculum.</p>
<p>The field-study internship led directly to a job after graduation. Today, Joy co-facilitates queer youth groups that meet weekly in Watsonville and Santa Cruz, supports Gender Sexuality Alliances at county schools, and organizes large-scale events like camping trips, marches and rallies, open mics and mixers, and an annual prom for queer youth. Joy's most recent accomplishment was helping queer youth create a mural at Louden Nelson Community Center that celebrates the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>"At UCSC, I was focused on resources for college students, but now I want to go earlier," said Joy. "Education about gender, consent, sexual health, and bodies should happen as young as possible&#8212;in age-appropriate ways, of course."</p>
<p><em>Broad interest in public health</em></p>
<p>The willingness of alumni like Joy, Cooper, and Garcia to come back to teach has been gratifying, said Steiner. Community Studies graduates feel deep bonds to the program and the campus, she said.</p>
<p>Steiner has taught in Community Studies for 18 years. Interest in public health has been a constant, and the class attracts students from a wide range of disciplines, including human biology, psychology, and anthropology.</p>
<p>"Some take it because they think it will help them get into medical school, but the social dimensions of health are new concepts for them&#8212;things like the number of uninsured, or the impact of living under a highway on a mother's health," she said. "It's mind blowing for them&#8212;in a good way. Getting the science students talking to the feminist studies students is really great."</p>
<p>In its 50th year, Community Studies is more timely than ever, said Steiner.</p>
<p>"Pick a field&#8212;anything to do with making a better world&#8212;and you'll find Community Studies graduates," said Steiner. "What makes this major so inspiring is that these students are serious and really dogged about their pursuit of equity and justice&#8212;in health and so many other realms.

UC Santa Cruz retirees appear especially active.<br/><br/>Drawing on a survey of 4,478 retirees, the report, <a href="http://cucra.ucsd.edu/survey/RetireeSurveyReport.pdf"><em>UC Retirees: Advocates, Ambassadors, Assets</em></a>, finds former UC employees have continued productive and engaged lifestyles. It quotes one respondent who said retirees &#8220;retired from working but not from living.&#8221; <br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz Retiree Association member Lee Duffus exemplifies active former staff, volunteering both for the UC Santa Cruz Retirees Association and for off-campus groups. The former Associate Vice Chancellor of Student Services led the committee that created the survey for the statewide Council of UC Retiree Associations. <br/><br/>The survey found particularly high volunteerism at UC Santa Cruz, which Duffus attributed to the loyalty former staff feel. <br/><br/>&#8220;A lot of us have devoted our careers to the institution,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/>Parking seems to be a factor for retirees&#8217; on-campus activities. UC Santa Cruz affords free parking permits to its retirees. Parking restrictions were an obstacle to involvement in other campuses.<br/><br/>Duffus said his committee created the report to complement <a href="http://cucea.ucsd.edu/documents/AVirtualEleventhCampus.pdf">a survey of emeriti faculty</a> that shows retired professors continue teaching and conducting research.<br/><br/><strong>Not much changes</strong><br/><br/>Emeritus chemistry professor Todd Wipke said that for many of his fellow faculty, retirement isn&#8217;t a cessation of work, but a change in the relationship with the campus. Wipke has carried on his own research, serves as president of the local emeriti association, and for several years after he retired he sponsored research by graduate or undergraduate students. <br/><br/>&#8220;My wife said &#8216;not much changes,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was in my office every day.&#8221;<br/><br/>The biggest difference for Wipke was that he stopped teaching classes. He said one colleague still leads classes 20 years into retirement and another has published 50 papers since he retired. <br/><br/>&#8220;Nobody is being paid to do this,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;The motivating force here is the person themselves and what they enjoy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A virtual 11th UC campus</strong><br/><br/>Statewide the collective ongoing work of emeriti faculty produces an equivalent amount equivalent of research to a whole separate research university. Wipke noted that a 2016 report by the Council of University of California Emeriti Association was titled &#8220;A Virtual Eleventh Campus.&#8221;<br/><br/>Retirees represent a significant source of financial donations, pledging more than $11 million in planned gifts and contributing $1.8 million to UC Santa Cruz programs from 2013 to 2016.<br/><br/>About one in eight retirees reported doing some part-time work for their former campuses. While drawing a pension, retirees are limited to 43 percent time and may only be appointed a year at a time. The survey suggests taking advantage of the skills and experience of retirees could save money and time for the UC system. <br/><br/>University retirees also contribute to their communities as volunteers in cultural and educational organizations. Statewide, 63 percent reported performing volunteer work in their communities, a rate more than twice as high as is typical for retirement-aged populations. <br/><br/><strong>Rich and full of opportunities</strong><br/><br/>Like many survey respondents, Duffus also gives time to off-campus organizations. He serves on the board of the Cabrillo College Foundation and volunteers to help bring Santa Cruz Symphony and Santa Cruz Shakespeare programs to nearby schools. His community volunteering is driven by the gratifying feeling that his efforts extend the reach of these groups.<br/><br/>Duffus said he actually struggles with the word &#8220;retirement,&#8221; calling his post-career experience &#8220;rich&#8221; and &#8220;full of opportunities.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;Our language hasn&#8217;t come up with anything better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Retirees don&#8217;t just shut down and sit on top of their pensions. They&#8217;re active people.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8c99bb37807270177f502a173065a751"><name>socsci-alumni</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz honors alumni: bestselling author Hector Tobar and historian Virginia Espino </title><summary>Award-winning journalist and author Héctor Tobar and filmmaker Virginia Espino are the 2018 recipients of the Social Sciences Division's Distinguished Alumni Award.</summary><keywords>tobar, espino, alumni award, social sciences</keywords><start-date>1522738800000</start-date><display-name>SocSci-Alumni</display-name><path>/2018/04/socsci-alumni</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/socsci-alumni</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1522777306870</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1523392596692</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value><value>Sociology</value><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/tobar-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/tobar-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tobar-450.jpg</name><display-name>tobar-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>39036</file-size><width>450</width><height>245</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Virginia Espino and Héctor Tobar</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/tobar-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/tobar-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tobar-80.jpg</name><display-name>tobar-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7972</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Héctor Tobar</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Virginia Espino and H&#233;ctor Tobar will be honored for their "sustained and exemplary contributions to society" during a public reception on Friday, April 27.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>2018 Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award recognizes contributions to society</article-subhead><article-text><p>An award-winning journalist, H&#233;ctor Tobar is perhaps best known for his bestselling account of 33 Chilean miners who were buried alive for 69 days. Virginia Espino is an oral historian and filmmaker who has documented the civil rights struggles of California's Latinx community.</p>
<p>These two talented storytellers, known for their dedication to telling the stories of those whose voices are muted, will be honored by the UC Santa Cruz Division of Social Sciences for their sustained and exemplary contributions to society during a free public reception on Friday, April 27, at 2 p.m. in the La Felix Room at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. The public is invited to join the celebration; please <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/social-sciences-distinguished-alumni-award-2/">register</a> here.</p>
<p>Tobar and Espino are recipients of the Division of Social Science's 2018 Distinguished Alumni Award. This marks the first time two award recipients were selected; Tobar and Espino, who met at UCSC, are married and the parents of three children.</p>
<p>"H&#233;ctor Tobar and Virginia Espino are change agents," said Katharyne Mitchell, dean of the Division of Social Sciences. "Through their work and their commitment to truth and justice, they have empowered individuals, educated the public, and helped create a more fair and compassionate society. It is an honor to recognize their contributions and celebrate their achievements, especially during UCSC's Year of Alumni."</p>
<p>Tobar, a 1988 graduate of Oakes College with degrees in sociology and Latin American Studies, is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has written for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>LA Weekly</em>, and other publications. His book, <em>Deep Down Dark: The Untold Stories of 33 Men Buried in a Chilean Mine and the Miracle That Set Them Free</em>, became the definitive account of the 2010 mining disaster that captivated the world. Based on exclusive interviews with survivors, <em>Deep Down Dark </em>was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist. Tobar's other books include the novel&#160;<em>The Tattooed Soldier</em> and the nonfiction&#160;<em>Translation Nation: Defining a New American Identity in the Spanish-Speaking United States</em>. The son of Guatemalan immigrants, Tobar is an associate professor of Chicano/Latino Studies, English, and literary journalism at UC Irvine.</p>
<p>Espino, a 1987 graduate of Merrill College with a degree in psychology, is a historian who has documented the struggle for social change. Her investigation of the coercive sterilization of immigrant women from Mexico at Los Angeles County General Hospital in the 1970s inspired the Emmy-nominated documentary <em>No M&#225;s Beb&#233;s/No More Babies</em>. Espino conducted oral histories with the women when she was in graduate school, and then served as producer and lead historian on the film, which aired on PBS in 2016. Espino teaches in the Chicana and Chicano Studies Department and in the Labor and Workplace Studies program at UCLA.</p>
<p>The reception will include the screening of a clip from Espino's film, as well as the reading of an excerpt from <em>Deep Down Dark</em>.</p>
<p>The Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award is given annually to a graduate of the division whose career is characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service. Past recipients include marriage equality advocate <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/03/perry-award.html">Kris Perry</a> (Merrill College '86, sociology and psychology), Pulitzer Prize winner <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2006/02/819.html">Dana Priest</a> (&#8217;81, politics, Merrill), and NPR science correspondent <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/aronson-palca.html">Joe Palca</a> (&#8217;82, psychology Ph.D.).</p>
<p>As part of a 2015 <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-life-realized.html">feature</a> about alumni authors in the UC Santa Cruz magazine, Tobar wrote that he arrived on campus as a pre-med major but "quickly switched to the study of Latin American history, and to the theories of injustice and social change. Writing became my passion, in part because I was often in small classrooms where my professors worked hard at critiquing and editing my papers. UC Santa Cruz made me a thinker and a writer."</p>

<p>Arriving from La Jolla in Southern California, Maloney (Stevenson, &#8217;71, psychology) had come to the wooded campus to become a psychologist. But what caught her imagination while working in the college admissions office was the architecture of the eclectic university: the idiosyncratic modern style of Kresge College, the imposing concrete and glass buildings on Science Hill.</p>
<p>Soon, she was enrolled in a masters program in architecture at UC Berkeley and today is an award-winning planning and design principal at the architectural firm Page in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In her four-decade-long career, Maloney, who lives in Sausalito, has done master plan and design work for Carnegie Mellon University; Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia; UC San Francisco and UC Merced, among others. She also has done urban design and community planning projects in cities across the country. Currently, Maloney is part of the Long Range Development Plan process as UC Santa Cruz prepares for its future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about putting the pieces together and problem solving,&#8221; Maloney said of her career.</p>
<p>An only child who was something of a bookworm, Maloney also had a competitive side. She played golf in junior high and high school and was good enough to consider playing in college but she decided to come to Santa Cruz instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;What stood out for me about Barbara,&#8221; said Gregg Herken (Stevenson, &#8217;69, history and politics) who met Maloney at UC Santa Cruz, &#8220;was that she was somebody people could confide in. She was a good listener and had interesting things to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those traits have come in handy for Maloney whose job requires her to listen to opinions, gather information on everything from energy and water issues to geology, and come up with creative solutions to any number of problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara is bright and she works hard and she also can see the viewpoint of other people without being threatened by it,&#8221; said Herken, a retired university history professor who is a longtime friend of Maloney. &#8220;She&#8217;s level headed and doesn&#8217;t panic easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like the time a bear invaded the campsite where she was staying with friends in Yosemite and stole all their food.</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t get overwrought,&#8221; Herken says.</p>
<p>Maloney, who helped in the planning process for the brand-new UC Merced, said working in higher education is &#8220;endlessly interesting,&#8221; involving not only issues like sustainability and town-gown relations but also transportation and new ways of learning.</p>
<p>For instance, instead of studying alone in the corner of a library, today&#8217;s students are more likely to learn in collaboration with one another which means locating and planning for study lounges, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To help colleges and universities figure out how to maintain and grow, or expand or even rework the campuses without growth? What better cause could you be working for?&#8221; Maloney said.</p>
<p>With close ties to the early years of UC Santa Cruz, when the campus and its system of separate colleges were touted as an unconventional place that pushed against the stodginess of educational institutions, Maloney said she is particularly interested in what role the colleges will continue to play in academic life on the hilltop campus.</p>
<p>Her ties with UC Santa Cruz extend into her personal life as well.</p>
<p>She and three male college friends have stayed in touch over the years and now meet and travel regularly. Calling themselves &#8220;The Chillers&#8221; after the 1983 comedy about college friends who meet for a weekend retreat after a funeral, &#8220;The Big Chill,&#8221; the alumni and their spouses have traveled together to Cuba, Mexico, the Napa Valley and will often rent a house together for a long weekend on Tomales Bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has interesting careers,&#8221; Maloney says. &#8220;They&#8217;re all really smart. We like politics, and food, and wine, and we like to cook. There&#8217;s never a dull moment.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="91b56432807270177f502a1762d8d34c"><name>pan-cancer-atlas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New 'Pan-Cancer' analysis reveals the common roots of different cancers</title><summary>In the largest study of its kind, cancer researchers analyzed and classified more than 10,000 tumors from 33 cancer types to trace connections between different cancers.</summary><keywords>Josh Stuart, Genomics Institute</keywords><start-date>1522944000000</start-date><display-name>New 'Pan-Cancer' analysis reveals the common roots of different cancers</display-name><path>/2018/04/pan-cancer-atlas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/pan-cancer-atlas</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1522863005661</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1522944781709</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Aylin Woodward</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/graphic-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/graphic-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>graphic-410.jpg</name><display-name>graphic-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>103124</file-size><width>410</width><height>283</height></image><image-alt>Pan-Cancer Atlas graphic</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/graphic-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/graphic-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>graphic-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>graphic-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23125</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Pan-Cancer Atlas graphic</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The Pan-Cancer Atlas is the most comprehensive cross-cancer analysis to date and is the final output of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, a joint effort of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).

</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Typically cancers are classified by where they originate in the body&#8212;think breast cancer, stomach cancer, and so on. But a collaboration called the Pan-Cancer Initiative, launched in 2012 at a meeting in Santa Cruz, California,</span> <span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">sought to study cancers from a new angle&#8212;a molecular one. Preliminary analyses showed cancers that start in different organs actually share commonalities at the molecular level, whereas cancers that originate from the same tissue can have very different genomic profiles.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Now, the Pan-Cancer Initiative has released the results of a much larger analysis of genomic and molecular data characterizing 33 different types of cancer from more than 10,000 patients. Called the <a href="https://pancanatlas.xenahubs.net&#8203;">Pan-Cancer Atlas</a>, it is the most comprehensive cross-cancer analysis to date and is the final output of <a href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a> program, a joint effort of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The results appear in <a href="http://www.cell.com/pb-assets/consortium/PanCancerAtlas/PanCani3/index.html">27 papers published April 5 in </a></span><a href="http://www.cell.com/pb-assets/consortium/PanCancerAtlas/PanCani3/index.html"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Cell, Cancer Cell, Cell Reports, </i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">and</span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i><a href="http://www.cell.com/pb-assets/consortium/PanCancerAtlas/PanCani3/index.html"> Immunity</a>.</i></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Insights about how one type of cancer relates to another form of the disease can have real clinical implications,&#8221; said</span> <span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Josh Stuart, Baskin Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at UC Santa Cruz and an organizer of the Pan-Cancer Initiative. &#8220;In some cases, we can borrow clinical practices from better-known diseases and apply them to cancers for which treatment options are less well defined.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Stuart's main collaborators on the pan-cancer analyses have been Christopher Benz, professor of cancer and developmental therapeutics at the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://www.buckinstitute.org/about"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Buck Institute for Research on Aging</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> and a clinical oncologist at UC San Francisco, and Christina Yau, assistant adjunct professor of surgery at UCSF and a senior scientist at the Buck Institute. Stuart and Benz are co-directors of the</span> <span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center, one of seven national centers in the TCGA Research Network.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Comprehensive analysis</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Working with an international team of researchers, they performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of the complete set of TCGA tumor data. The results showed that, based on their cellular and genetic makeup and independent of their anatomic site of origin, all 33 tumor types could be re-classified into 28 different molecular types, or &#8220;clusters.&#8221; Nearly two-thirds of these clusters were considered heterogeneous as they contained up to 25 different histological tumor types that, traditionally, would all be treated differently. These molecular analyses and clustering results, now also linked to multiple clinical outcome endpoints, are available to clinicians and researchers worldwide via a single TCGA portal. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This comprehensive body of final TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas analyses will provide a new foundation for future cancer research efforts and clinical trials,&#8221; Benz said. &#8220;It will also incentivize clinical oncologists to get newly diagnosed and recurrent tumors genomically characterized. Patients will have the best shot at successful treatment if their tumors can first be classified according to their genomic and molecular makeup.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The first wave of cross-tumor comparisons was completed in September 2013, when Stuart and his colleagues in the Pan-Cancer Initiative analyzed 12 types of tumors profiled by TCGA. While most tumors did end up being grouped by their tissue of origin, there were some common DNA, RNA, and protein signals that cut across those groupings. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It became clear, when we found similarities between different types of cancer, people wanted to do a more comprehensive comparison,&#8221; Stuart said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In 2014, he coauthored another pan-cancer paper in which the researchers sorted the tumors into subtypes, or clusters, using a statistical analysis of tumor molecular data. While a majority of the cancer subtypes matched their tissue-of-origin, some of the clusters consisted of tumors that originated in different parts of the body. The 2014 study indicated that one in 10 cancer patients would be classified differently using the new molecular classifications, and those differences could have ramifications for what types of treatment options or clinical trials should be made available to those patients.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Integral role</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">As co-leader of the Pan-Cancer working group for TCGA and the International Cancer Genomics Consortium, Stuart has played an integral role in ensuring the research compiled by the collaboration was organized under one common umbrella and overseen by a single steering committee. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Stuart helped organize the 27 Pan-Cancer Atlas papers published April 5 in </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Cell</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> Press journals.</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">He said the Pan-Cancer Initiative&#8217;s work so far resembles a giant tree, with roots representing different means of classifying tumors, and sub-roots branching off each of the main roots. This organizational structure provided the basis for &#8220;themed working groups,&#8221; rather than groups based on organ or tissue type. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Stuart and Benz are senior authors of one of the papers, <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30302-7">published in </a></span><a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30302-7"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Cell</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> and led by Peter Laird of Van Andel Research Institute, which provides a roadmap for other researchers seeking to delve into the findings of the various working groups. &#8220;It&#8217;s a survey of what kinds of overarching systems underlie the data. It&#8217;s less about clinical implications, and more about the patterns we&#8217;ve found,&#8221; Stuart said. The first authors of the paper include Yau and Christopher Wong, a staff scientist in Stuart's lab at the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Stuart said he is confident that once scientists start scrutinizing the data, clinical implications won&#8217;t be far behind. &#8220;Obviously, finding actionable pieces of logic from these root maps is the holy grail,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The milestone we hit with this paper is finally being able to stand back and look at the big picture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Tumor Map</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The <a href="https://tumormap.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Tumor Map</a>, an interactive browser developed by Yulia Newton and Adam Novak to help researchers visualize the data, displays patient samples on a Google Maps interface. Wong used the browser to compile a set of 10 panels in the </span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>Cell</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> paper illustrating the dominant patterns found in the data. These include the cell of origin, molecular histology, "stemness" or differentiation status, specific altered genetic pathways, and the immune system component of the tumors. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Looking at these Tumor Maps is like looking at the Earth from orbit for the first time,&#8221; Stuart said. &#8220;We now see cancer&#8217;s complete picture and it fills me with hope that we can understand its finite, not infinite, complexity.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">UC Santa Cruz has a legacy of creating browsers for the biological community, starting with the highly popular UCSC Genome Browser. &#8220;We are thrilled to make this rich data available to the public through this new portal,&#8221; Stuart said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Benz said the new TCGA data hold particular promise for expanding treatments designed to enlist the immune system to beat cancer, including approved immunotherapies now showing near-miraculous results against a limited number of classical cancer types. Remarkably, the study shows that one of the most heterogeneous of the observed 28 molecular clusters was composed of 25 different classical tumor types and exhibited very strong features linked to activation of the patient&#8217;s immune response. </span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This finding supports the growing notion that specific immunotherapies approved by the FDA for one cancer type would likely benefit patients with various other cancer types, if these other types could be molecularly identified,&#8221; Benz said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Drugs approved for other diseases could also be effective against some of the newly classified cancer types. &#8220;A couple of our newly defined cancer clusters also show activation of a molecular pathway (JAK/Stat) that&#8217;s commonly upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis,&#8221; said Yau, who provided bioinformatics expertise for much of TCGA&#8217;s work over the past decade. &#8220;Perhaps we can repurpose drugs used to treat that non-malignant chronic disease, as researchers will now have the molecular rationale to explore this novel treatment strategy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Even though TCGA is done&#8212;the database won&#8217;t be added to or changed&#8212;this same kind of comprehensive and collaborative multi-platform genomic analysis continues nationwide under new NCI sponsorship. Stuart, Benz, and Yau continue to work together as part of their bioinformatic analysis center for the newly constituted Genomic Data Analysis Network which, among other challenges, is tasked with determining clinically measurable biomarkers that would make it easier and more cost effective to identify a priori those same tumor molecular subsets identified by the TCGA network&#8217;s multi-platform analysis.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">It&#8217;s time to re-write the textbooks on cancer, and it&#8217;s time to break down the silos in clinical oncology that make it difficult for patients to take advantage of this paradigm shift in cancer classification,&#8221; said Benz.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30302-7</url><title>Cell-of-Origin

kicked up quite a storm recently when he published an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html">opinion piece</a> in the <em>New York Times</em> about genetics and race.</p>
<p>Entitled, "How Genetics is Changing Our Understanding of 'Race,'" the piece by David Reich provoked a swift response from scholars around the globe, including Jenny Reardon, a professor of sociology and the founding director of the Science and Justice Research Center at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Reardon helped write a response in the form of an <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfopinion/race-genetics-david-reich?utm_term=.qaRy3qRKa#.drlM3EPWx">open letter</a> signed by 67 scholars and researchers from leading universities, posted on BuzzFeed, entitled "How Not to Talk About Race and Genetics."</p>
<p>"Race has long been a potent way of defining differences between human beings. But science and the categories it constructs do not operate in a political vacuum," the piece begins.</p>
<p>The letter applauds Reich for challenging others' previous misrepresentations about race and genetics, but the authors say he falls short in the realm of "the cultural, political, and biological meanings of human groups."</p>
<p>The scholars, from a range of disciplines, say Reich's understanding is "seriously flawed" when he warns in the <em>Times </em>piece that "it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among 'races'."</p>
<p>Reich's column provoked other responses, including a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/03/denying-genetics-isnt-shutting-down-racism-its-fueling-it.html">piece</a> by Andrew Sullivan in <em>New York </em>magazine that called it "a rather seismic op-ed." Sullivan summed up Reich's piece by saying it "carefully advanced the case that there are genetic variations between subpopulations of humans, that these are caused, as in every other species, by natural selection, and that some of these variations are not entirely superficial and do indeed overlap with our idea of race." He asserted that Reich's argument "should not be so controversial&#8212;every species is subject to these variations&#8212;and yet it is."</p>
<p>Reardon is tracking developments from Germany, where she is conducting archival research on the history of the efforts of natural and social scientists to write "expert" statements on "race"&#8212;efforts that date back to the 1930s. She said this episode appears to be shaping up as a "touchstone moment."</p>
<p>"One of my big hopes is that this whole episode becomes a moment to model why and how we might&#8212;must&#8212;work together here at UCSC," she said. "Those 67 scholars who signed the BuzzFeed piece included geneticists and biological anthropologists. It was quite the process working it out&#8212;hundreds of emails."</p>
<p>Yet the effort appeared to be worthwhile, she said, noting that the BuzzFeed letter had received 75,000 views in the days following its posting.</p>
<p>"I do think it is going to be tricky navigating this," said Reardon, a leading voice in the field of genomics. She is the author of two books on the subject: <em>Race to the Finish: Identity and Governance in an Age of Genomics</em>, and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/reardon-postgenomic.html"><em>The Postgenomic Condition: Ethics, Justice, and Knowledge After the Genome</em></a>, which was published in January. &#160;</p>
<div>"The way this is playing out is if you critique Reich, you are anti-science," she observed.&#160;"This chills discussion and debate." Although the discussions are not easy, Reardon said she feels "some sense of responsibility. I do see this as an important moment to try&#160;and shape, and open up, the public dialogue at the powerful nexus of science, politics, and race."&#160;&#160;</div>

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Holt's talk, "Science, Politicians, and the Public: What's the Story?", is the 2018 Osterbrock Distinguished Leadership Lecture. With many public decisions being made on the basis of political partisanship rather than scientific evidence, what storyline should scientists follow, and what difference does it make for the practicing researcher? Holt will explore these questions and the role of scientific leadership in shaping public policy and opinion.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Holt is an American teacher, scientist, administrator, and policymaker. As CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), he leads the world's largest multi-disciplinary scientific and engineering membership organization. Prior to joining AAAS in 2015, Holt served as the U.S. Representative for New Jersey's 12th Congressional District, directed the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and taught physics at Swarthmore College. He holds M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from New York University.</span></p>

Its four floors of confined space were vertically</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>threaded through by a narrow stairway. On one occasion when Kip Thorne came to dinner, Stephen climbed up the stairway to retrieve something he wanted to show Kip. Jane stopped me when I offered to help. She indicated that Stephen would like to do everything by himself and the exercise was good for him. It was clearly evident that with Jane's steadfast devotion and tender loving care, Stephen was determined to live as normal a life as he possibly could. </span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><br/> <br/> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>On sunny days, Jane often took their toddlers to visit Stephen at the Institute of Astronomy, where a small area of the director's garden was carved out to be the Hawkings&#8217; vegetable plot. On one clear summer evening after their visit, I volunteered to help Stephen view Saturn through the Northumberland Telescope, where James Challis failed to discover Neptune a century earlier. Being a theorist</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>I was not particularly good at lining up the telescope pointing. Since Saturn was not much above the horizon, I had to put Stephen in a wooden chair to move up a laddered track. It was actually the first time he saw with his own eyes the spectacular rings of Saturn. He told me that Galileo was among the first to see Saturn's rings, and then proudly announced that he, Stephen Hawking, was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's passing. It is also notable that Hawking passed away on the 139th anniversary of Albert Einstein's birthday. </span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><br/> <br/> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>Much of the social life in Cambridge revolves around the colleges. I was in the same college, Gonville and Caius, as Stephen. The master of the college was Joseph Needham, whose monumental contribution on the history of science and civilization of China was often the focal point of conversation over formal dinners around the high table. Stephen regularly participated in these social gatherings, where scholars of different disciplines inspired each other. In order for him to get up to the second-floor dining hall, Stephen had to delicately maneuver his wheelchair through the food delivery elevator in the college kitchen. Physical disability and speech impediment did not diminish his active engagement in these uniquely intellectual social events.<br/> <br/> The Institute of Astronomy received many distinguished visitors. In the mid 1970s, the great mathematician and astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar gave a colloquium on relativistic</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>ellipsoidal figures. In a manner similar to the arguments in his encyclopedic books, Chandra methodically</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>presented some very complex equations which were beautifully derived and</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>hand-written on many transparency sheets for the overhead projector. Halfway through the lecture, a voice from the back of the room mumbled some incomprehensible comment. After a minute of silence, one of Stephen's</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>students translated his joking remark that &#8220;the second term on the third line on page 7 has a sign error.&#8221; While everyone burst out with laughter, Chandra looked seriously and thoughtfully at the equation in</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>question and then declared, &#8220;The sign is correct!&#8221;</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><br/> <br/> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>It was also during this period that Hawking made the discovery of black hole</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>radiation.

On the occasion of mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern's visit, Stephen and Jane came to our home for dinner. We were terrified when he choked on a piece of chicken.

By the late 1970s, Stephen's ALS had advanced to the stage that he had to use a motorized wheelchair. This gadget became the favorite toy go-cart for his own and other visiting young children. His smiles reflected his amusement and pleasure on these occasions. </span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><br/> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span><br/> Stephen Hawking&#8217;s inspiration and persona made him an instant superstar.</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>He enjoyed his role as a public figure and the limelight everywhere he went. While most people would complain about inconvenience and avoid long-haul flights, Stephen was actually invigorated by adventures into exotic places, from the Great Wall to the White House. He was eager and enthusiastic to experience a weightless flight in a NASA training plane.<br/> <br/> Unfortunately, during one trip to Switzerland he came down with life-threatening pneumonia. Jane decisively ordered an emergency airlift to bring Stephen back to the U.K. The tracheotomy operation, though it saved his life, completely disabled his vocal cords.</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>When I visited him in the Addenbrook's Hospital in Cambridge a few weeks</span></span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> </span></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span>later, he appeared to be very depressed and seemed to have lost the will to live. Jane was at his bedside and tried to help him to develop a new way of communicating through eye movement over the alphabet board mounted on a transparent frame. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of technology soon enabled him to acquire a voice synthesizer that he could control with his thumb.

<div>Officers with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department arrested Jeff Gatlin, a non-affiliate, on March 20 after a student reported seeing him leave her dorm room. The student discovered that there were belongings missing from her apartment.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Gatlin was found near the Performing Arts Center in possession of the victim's stolen property. He was transported to the Santa Cruz County Jail.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Although there is no known connection to Gatlin, the department continues to investigate a burglary at the Humanities 1 building that happened sometime between March 15-16. The suspect or suspects broke into two offices and stole computers and monitors.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyone who may be a witness or has information regarding these crimes is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831-459-2231, ext. 1.</div>

<p>The fifth college founded at the campus was renamed Porter College in 1981, and a gift of nearly 70 acres of Porter-Sesnon land created an endowment for the college that has provided countless scholarships, grants, and funding for Porter undergraduates and programs.</p>
<p>In 1968, a gift from Barbara Sesnon Cartan also established the <a href="http://art.ucsc.edu/sesnon"><strong><em>Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery</em></strong> </a>at UC Santa Cruz, in memory of her mother. And now in 2018, the gallery will present a special exhibition celebrating the life of Mary Porter Sesnon (1868-1930) and her influence on the arts in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Titled &#8220;Mary Porter Sesnon and Pino Alto,&#8221; it opens on April 12, with a public reception at the gallery beginning at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Mary Porter spent her childhood in Soquel, CA, before moving to Los Angeles and San Francisco, and traveling to Europe with her family. She married William T. Sesnon in 1896 and together they returned to her childhood property, where they built a summer home called Pino Alto and hosted cultural salons from 1911 to 1927. (Pino Alto was named after a tall pine tree near the driveway; it is now called the Sesnon House and serves as headquarters for the culinary arts program and restaurant for Cabrillo College in Aptos).</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz exhibition will feature sketches and watercolors from a remarkable scrapbook made during those historic Santa Cruz salons, including calligraphy by Mary Porter Sesnon, along with paintings by California artists such as Will Sparks, a painter known for his depictions of California missions; Ferdinand Burgdorff, celebrated for his works on coastal views<strong>; </strong>Haig Patigian, a renowned neoclassical sculptor; and landscape artist Cor de Gavere, a member of the &#8220;Santa Cruz 3,&#8221; along with fellow artists Leonora N. Penniman and Margaret E. Rogers<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The exhibition places Ms. Sesnon at the center of it all--organizing creative salon-type parties that helped break down social and intellectual barriers and brought a variety of people together in new ways,&#8221; said curator Shelby Graham, director of the Sesnon Gallery.</p>
<p>&#8220;These salons were gatherings that lasted for days,&#8221; Graham added. &#8220;Artists of all types attended, from painters to playwrights, politicians, family, friends, and members of the LBGT community. The scrapbook on display from the salons is filled with original poetry, musical scores, paintings, drawings, limericks, comments, and signatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Graham noted that the Sesnon Gallery continues to host salons today as contemporary academic gatherings for lively discussions and performances.</p>
<p>&#8220;This narrative has been brewing in my mind for the past 20 years as director of the Sesnon Gallery,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;Students at UC Santa Cruz are eager to hear this tale of bringing friends together to share art, stories, food and ideas that question the political climate of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The work of Sesnon&#8217;s great-granddaughter</strong>, UC Santa Cruz alumna Molly Porter Cliff Hilts, and other Sesnon family members can also be found in the show. In fact, Hilts&#8217; recent paintings and larger-than-life drawings will be featured in the adjacent Porter Faculty Gallery during the exhibition.</p>
<p>&#8220;My great-grandmother was a muse with a strong sense of community,&#8221; Hilts noted. &#8220;She loved to bring people together. These attributes resonate with, and echo, my own life's path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hilts graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1981, with a B.A. in Fine Art from Porter College. Her art is part of an emerging form that melds painting, photography and printing, using wax, lithographic ink, oil and graphite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I entered UCSC my junior year, and I loved riding my bike up the hill with my heavy art history books in my backpack, amidst the golden rolling hills and big oak trees, with the backdrop of the Monterey Bay,&#8221; Hilts recalled in a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/50th-alumni-art.html"><strong><em>2015 interview</em></strong></a>. &#8220;I loved my classes: astronomy, Russian, art history, printmaking, sculpture, and especially photography with Norman Locks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made friends for life at UCSC and stayed in Santa Cruz after college, for a few years, working for a couple of local architecture and design firms,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Hilts&#8217; artwork can now be found in notable collections worldwide, including the private collection of Bill and Melinda Gates.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Stream restoration efforts along the coast of Central California are unevenly distributed, with activity more likely to occur in areas that are more highly populated and dominated by residents who are "whiter, wealthier, and more educated," according to an analysis by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>In addition, coastal stream restoration is heavily concentrated in Santa Cruz, Morro Bay, and southern Santa Barbara County, creating "restoration deserts" with virtually no activity, said lead author Bronwen Stanford, a doctoral candidate in environmental studies.</p>
<p>"Restoration projects were really unevenly distributed, and a lot of the Central Coast had no projects at all," said Stanford. "This disparity is troubling for social and ecological reasons. It begs the question, are we overlooking certain communities or certain types of ecological sites?"</p>
<p>Stanford's paper, "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320717320049"><em>Where and why does restoration happen? Ecological and sociopolitical influences on stream restoration in Coastal California</em></a>," appears in the May issue of <em>Biological Conservation</em>, which is online now.</p>
<p><em>Ecological and social drivers</em></p>
<p>Stanford's study looked at 699 sites of publicly funded stream restoration projects between Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara counties that were completed between 1983 and 2017.</p>
<p>Stream restoration projects benefit ecosystems by improving fish habitat, water quality, and riparian habitat&#8212;the interface between land and rivers or streams. Human-oriented benefits include improved recreational access, flood protection, and educational outreach and training.</p>
<p>Stanford's analysis found that restoration projects target many areas of ecological need. The presence of native fish was the biggest ecological factor driving the distribution of restoration sites, with steelhead present in 95 percent of sites. Water quality and riparian conditions were other environmental drivers.</p>
<p>On the social side, Stanford found that stream restoration occurred most frequently in a particular type of community: those with higher percentages of residents who are wealthy, non-Hispanic white, and have college degrees. Stanford identified three mechanisms that could explain the distribution pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, communities with higher incomes could be better able to provide matching funds required by most restoration grants.</li>
<li>Second, wealthier residents with higher levels of education might be more adept at securing a disproportionate share of restoration funding.&#160;</li>
<li>Third, local demographics may influence the location of restoration organizations, which in turn may influence site selection. Stanford found that restoration is often dependent on the existence of a local organization, and they are more likely to be present in areas with wealthy, white, and educated populations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results suggest that not all residents are benefitting equally from public funds spent on restoration projects, and not all areas of ecological need are getting attention, said Stanford.</p>
<p>"Most restoration was hyper local&#8212;happening within 12 miles of a restoration organization's office&#8212;so we might be missing some really important sites that aren't right next to an office," said Stanford.</p>
<p>The social disparities didn't surprise coauthor Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"We know that other environmental benefits, like clean air and water, are not equitably distributed in California to even greater degrees," said Zavaleta. "Whatever the cause of this inequity, the outcome is a relative lack of restoration investment in lower-income communities with larger populations of color and with less college education. Environmental quality is foundational to health and well-being, and disadvantaged communities need more investment, not less."</p>
<p>Conservationists, she said, can and should be looking for opportunities to restore sites and take on other environmental projects in communities where these investments are lacking. "They could be social, as well as ecological, game changers," she said.</p>
<p>Stanford, like Zavaleta, suggests a more diverse conservation workforce would help benefit more types of communities, and she called for a regional approach to environmental planning.</p>
<p>"We need to think regionally, because we are missing places," she said. &#8220;Areas like the Salinas River watershed are important for fish and other wildlife. They are highly impacted by human activities, and yet had relatively few restoration projects. A regional approach would help us focus on areas of highest need, rather than just communities that are good at applying for funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross Clark is director of the Central Coast Wetlands Group at Moss Landing Marine Laboratory, which performs restoration work from Santa Cruz to Santa Barbara with a focus on the Salinas Valley. He agrees that a regional approach is desirable.</p>
<p>The challenge of how to distribute state funding more equitably is complicated, in part because funding waxes and wanes, and priorities shift, he said. "Preferential selection" for state-funded water projects that benefit disadvantaged communities will help. "But there are still huge hurdles to overcome," said Clark. "To develop a project&#8212;to apply for and administer grants&#8212;requires a significant amount of infrastructure, staff, programs, and coordination among local agencies and nonprofits. Lower-income areas just don't have the same levels of support to get these projects."</p>
<p>Clark favors an approach that integrates environmental objectives into long-term water-management efforts that currently tend to be focused on storm water management and water quality, rather than ecological restoration.</p>

<h2>Has the CP/EVC and Senate leadership worked out a timeline for Senate review of the Strategic Academic Plan?</h2>
<p>Yes. Senate leadership and I have recently come to an agreement on a timeline that will afford the opportunity for a comprehensive Senate review and, just as importantly, time for meaningful consideration of Senate feedback and for implementation to start during the 2018-19 academic year. I am grateful to Senate Chair &#211;l&#1255;f Einarsd&#243;ttir, Vice Chair Kim Lau, and Planning and Budget Committee Chair Carl Walsh for their creative, thoughtful efforts to work with me in developing a practical way forward.</p>
<p>Senate engagement is critical to our SAP process, and I have deep respect for our shared governance and for our Senate leadership. Indeed, the Senate was the first group I consulted on the possibility of producing a SAP. While many universities simply bring together senior leadership to set a strategic direction, that didn&#8217;t seem right for UC Santa Cruz. Ours is a campus in which broader engagement matters. At the launch of the planning process, I requested we solicit Senate input on a wide range of consequential issues pertaining to internal barriers, development of resource streams, and resource and FTE allocation. And I&#8217;ve asked that all of the reports produced by our consultants be sent out for Senate review and comment as soon as they arrive. I have no doubt our plan will be enriched through the Senate&#8217;s active participation, and I look forward to its ongoing involvement over the course of the year.</p>
<p>We expect to have a first draft of the SAP in June. While the Senate will have seen all major components of the plan, as each piece is produced and posted along the way, this will be the first time all parts of the plan will be united. Senate leadership and I have agreed to complete the review by Aug. 31. This will permit time to consider and incorporate Senate feedback, present the plan to campus, allow our deans to engage their departments regarding the 2018-19 faculty FTE call, and permit the same Senate committee membership that has seen the materials all along to opine. I will gladly compensate committee members who engage in plan review over the summer. The chancellor and I will be pleased to receive Senate feedback in a timely fashion, so that we can deploy our resources strategically during the 2018-19 academic year. Without Senate input on this timeline, we do not feel it would be appropriate for us to proceed allocating resources including FTE. We genuinely care about the Senate insights and want to make sure our strategic directions reflect our engagement with them.</p>
<h2>Is my research area/department likely to wither if my Themed Academic Working Group is not ultimately selected as a campus priority area?</h2>
<p>No. We will commit to a strategic investment of resources, but we also have an earnest commitment to offer a comprehensive liberal arts and sciences education. It is foundational to our identity, and each of our curricular areas depends upon and benefits from the contribution of the others. Every UC Santa Cruz student should experience and grow from the full richness of our curriculum. In addition, we hope that our new focus on resource generation will enable us to advance all areas of the university.</p>
<p>Moreover, the focus of our SAP on eliminating barriers should improve the research and teaching opportunities for everyone on campus. The Senate, the academic departments and leadership, and many support units have responded at length to our request to identify internal barriers to their work. In many cases, they have even provided imaginative solutions. Over the coming months we will work with the Senate and the deans to rank the significance of the many barriers you&#8217;ve identified, then engage a staff implementation group to develop options for their reduction or elimination.</p>
<h2>Is campus feedback being taken into account in the SAP process?</h2>
<p>Absolutely, and it is worth naming a few of the ways in which this has happened.</p>
<ul>
<li>We responded to more than 250 email questions and ideas and have made numerous adjustments to the process in response to the thoughtful suggestions of faculty, staff, and students.</li>
<li>We added student representatives to the Academic Advisory Committee, the group charged with evaluating, shaping, and ranking our academic priorities.</li>
<li>We created the Themed Academic Working Groups to ensure all academic employees have an opportunity to make a case for what their research areas could accomplish with the right support.</li>
<li>We provided an online forum for discussion of SAP topics.</li>
<li>We posted online notes from every committee and group meeting held to date.</li>
<li>We added eight community forums to provide updates, take questions, and get your feedback.</li>
<li>We scheduled meetings with every interested department to explain the SAP process and receive comments.</li>
<li>And finally, we extended the timeline for Senate review to ensure adequate consultation and the ability to allocate resources strategically during the 2018-19 academic year.</li>
</ul>

<p class="western"><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192132"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Published April 11 in</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i> PLOS ONE</i></span></a><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><i>,</i></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> the study compares the cost effectiveness of nature-based and artificial solutions for flood reduction across the Gulf of Mexico. The results clearly demonstrate the value of nature-based solutions such as marsh and oyster-reef restoration. Overall, wetland and reef restoration can yield benefit-to-cost ratios greater than seven to one, meaning more than $7 in direct flood-reduction benefits for every $1 spent on restoration. Many artificial solutions (such as levees and home elevation) have benefit-to-cost ratios near or below one-to-one; their benefits can be high, but they are expensive to implement at scale.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The study was led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz, the Nature Conservancy, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at ETH Zurich. It applied the <a href="http://www.swissre.com/eca/">Economics of Climate Adaptation</a> (ECA) approach, which was developed by reinsurance company Swiss Re and partners to understand what drives coastal risk and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adaptation options.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Increasing risks</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The devastating 2017 hurricane season offered a harsh reminder of the destructive power and economic impacts of coastal storms. The U.S. Gulf Coast faces intense hurricanes, as well as land subsidence and rising sea level, and climate change is increasing the risks of coastal flooding.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The new study quantified the flood risks to people and property for the entire U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico under current and future climate scenarios and economic growth projections. It showed that future flood risks from coastal hazards will grow, and that the major driver of risk in the Gulf is coastal development, particularly for the most extreme and costly events: the more people and property exposed to coastal hazards, the greater the flooding risk. Climate change, however, will result in more frequent losses. Events causing $100 billion in damages may become approximately three times more frequent in the future, the study found.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">State and federal agencies are investing in coastal protection strategies to reduce these risks, but most of the funds are going toward so-called "gray infrastructure," such as seawalls, which can further degrade coastal ecosystems. There is growing interest in "green" or nature-based options, such as restoration of coastal wetlands, but comparative studies of their effectiveness have been lacking.</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Cost effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">This study is the first to quantitatively compare the cost effectiveness of a wide suite of natural and artificial flood reduction measures across an entire region. In the Gulf of Mexico, oyster reefs, coastal wetlands, barrier islands, and beach dunes provide coastal protection by reducing wave energy, trapping sediments, and attenuating storm surge.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">We show that nature-based measures for flood reduction can be considered right alongside artificial or gray measures such as seawalls in industry-based benefit-cost models. This removes a major impediment for engineers, insurers, and risk management agencies for building coastal resilience more naturally,&#8221; said project team leader Michael Beck, lead marine scientist at the Nature Conservancy and a research professor at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The study found that nature-based solutions alone could help avert more than 45 percent of the climate risk over a 20-year period, saving more than $50 billion in flood damages, with average benefit to cost ratios above 3.5. Nature-based solutions can be directly compared with artificial, "gray" measures in a common framework using open-source tools based on those used by the insurance risk industry. In the Gulf of Mexico, the study found, oyster reef and marsh restoration are among the most cost-effective solutions for flood risk reduction. These nature-based solutions can be even more cost effective if additional ecosystem services such as fisheries, recreation, and other benefits are considered.</span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The need for adaptation is increasing, and the cost of inaction is too high,&#8221; said lead author Borja Reguero, a coastal engineer at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;Our &#8216;adaptation gap&#8217; requires innovative approaches and targeted research to inform our investments in protection and risk management, and to balance the goals of development, conservation, and public safety.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The team developed open-source software based in part on Swiss Re&#8217;s natural catastrophe model to assess flood risks and adaptation solutions. All of the results and maps showing the cost effectiveness of adaptation solutions under future climate change and development scenarios are available in an interactive mapper available online at <a href="http://maps.coastalresilience.org/gulfmex/">CoastalResilience.org</a>. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b09283f0807270177f502a17e3a87446"><name>child-care-dialogue</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Input sought on the future child care program at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Please join us for an open dialogue session regarding the future child care program at UC Santa Cruz.  &#13;

<p>On April 4 the campus issued a Notice of Preparation to request input regarding the scope and content of the draft environmental impact report. An information and scoping session will be held from 5&#8211;7 p.m. on April 17 at the Kresge College Town Hall. The meeting is open to the public.</p>
<p>The Kresge College renewal project will be composed of new construction, renovation, and selective removal of buildings. The project will expand the college&#8217;s living-learning environment with additional space for residential, academic, and student support programs while addressing issues of accessibility, code compliance, and sustainability throughout the site</p>
<p>The project will increase housing for students, adding between 175 and 225 student beds to the approximately 365 currently provided within the college. New construction will increase the total College size from 133,000 to 200,000 gross square feet.</p>
<p>Fourteen buildings will be renovated, in some cases rehabilitating residential buildings as academic and student support spaces. In order to provide an accessible route through the college, recycled water storage, larger gathering spaces to anchor the college communities, and expanded program space, nine existing buildings&#8212;two of which were not part of the original college design&#8212;would be removed. Four buildings will be newly constructed, including an academic building, two or three residential buildings for first-year students, and a student assembly space.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the project is to embrace the important legacy of the site by retaining the character-defining site organization and landscape features and the majority of existing buildings while amplifying the campus&#8217; relationship to the natural environment by improving the natural landscape and bringing existing buildings up to higher standards of sustainability.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b0c406fc807270177f502a17d6d41e63"><name>drone-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Unmanned aircraft system (drone) policy</title><summary>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) recently finalized the University of California Unmanned Aircraft System (Drone) Policy and an accompanying guidance document.</summary><start-date>1523343600000</start-date><display-name>UC policy</display-name><path>/2018/04/drone-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/drone-policy</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1523384058528</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1523384058528</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Office of the President (UCOP) recently finalized the University of California Unmanned Aircraft System (Drone) <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3500671/Drone">Policy</a> and an accompanying <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/enterprise-risk-management/_files/uas/uas-policy-guidance-document.pdf">guidance document</a>.</p>
<p>The systemwide policy was developed in response to the growing usage of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), commonly known as drones. An increasing number of UC faculty, staff, and students fly for university business. At UC Santa Cruz we also have a number of visitors flying drones on campus.</p>
<p>The UCOP UAS policy is intended to address the widespread use of drones across a diverse range of applications throughout the UC system. To facilitate the implementation of the UCOP policy, a UCSC campus-specific policy will be developed to address the needs of our campus. UCSC Environmental Health and Safety (EH&amp;S) will begin drafting a campus UAS policy this spring with the intent of finalizing the document by next year.</p>
<p>Information on the existing UCSC drone safety program can be <a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/research-safety/drones.html">found online</a>. Any flights on the UCSC campus, or for UCSC business, should be conducted in compliance with local and federal laws and in consideration of public safety, privacy, and civil rights. Questions regarding the UCSC drone safety program or comments on the upcoming campus policy can be directed to uas@ucsc.edu.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor, Business and Administrative Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b18ea541807270177f502a17c1c0171b"><name>goldwater-scholar</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Engineering undergraduate wins prestigious Goldwater Scholarship</title><summary>Aviv Elor, a junior studying robotics engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been named a 2017 Goldwater Scholar.</summary><keywords>Goldwater Scholar, Aviv Elor</keywords><start-date>1523343600000</start-date><display-name>Engineering undergraduate wins prestigious Goldwater Scholarship</display-name><path>/2018/04/goldwater-scholar</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/goldwater-scholar</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1523397337071</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1523564235067</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/aviv-elor-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/aviv-elor-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aviv-elor-350.jpg</name><display-name>aviv-elor-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>90729</file-size><width>350</width><height>385</height></image><image-alt>Aviv Elor</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/aviv-elor-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/aviv-elor-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aviv-elor-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>aviv-elor-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24914</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Aviv Elor</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Aviv Elor</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Aviv Elor, a junior studying robotics engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been named a 2017 Goldwater Scholar by the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation.</span></p>
<p class="western"><a name="_GoBack"></a> <span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The Goldwater Scholarship is a prestigious national competition for undergraduates in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. The scholarships provide up to $7,500 per year for sophomores and juniors from across the country to cover the costs of tuition, fees, books, and other expenses.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The foundation awarded 211 scholarships this year, selecting the scholars on the basis of academic merit from a field of 1,280 students nominated by representatives of colleges and universities nationwide.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Elor has been working on a research project to develop virtual reality applications to help patients in physical rehabilitation from stroke. His advisers are Mircea Teodorescu, associate professor of computer engineering, and Sri Kurniawan, professor of computational media. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Elor&#8217;s first research experience was with Teodorescu, working on an autonomous drone project. In 2016, however, he suffered an elbow injury in a national judo competition, which required reconstructive surgery and extensive physical rehabilitation. When he learned that Teodorescu and Kurniawan were working on a project to improve the rehabilitation experience, he was eager to contribute. Elor developed a virtual reality game called Project Star Catcher, in which players perform rehabilitative arm motions by catching falling stars in a fun virtual environment. The project has involved teaming up with physical therapists, stroke survivors, and their caregivers at Cabrillo College&#8217;s Stroke and Disability Learning Center. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Elor has presented his research at an international conference and submitted it for publication in peer-reviewed journals. He plans to pursue a Ph.D. in computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>As a clinical psychologist working in the juvenile court system, Shelly Grabe was eager to help youth. She wanted to make a lasting difference in their lives. But she felt like she was doing little more than putting a Band-Aid on a gaping societal wound.</p>
<p>That's when a fateful trip to Nicaragua in 2005 changed her life. Grabe, now an associate professor of psychology, met women who were organizing to fight domestic violence, and she saw what real and lasting social change looked like.</p>
<p>These women were combatting domestic violence by helping women claim ownership of land to which they were entitled. Becoming property owners empowered the women, and that had ripple effects: rates of domestic violence dropped, the women asserted their rights to birth control, and they began to raise their daughters differently, insisting they attend school.</p>
<p>Grabe was captivated by the social psychological benefits of what was, in essence, a human rights campaign. "As one woman put it, she felt like she went from <em>being</em> property to <em>owning </em>property," said Grabe.</p>
<p>Feeling compelled to document the profound social change that was unfolding before her eyes, Grabe secured a $9,000 research grant and proceeded to interview more than 300 women&#8212;the kind of large-scale, data-collection effort the World Health Organization undertakes with hundreds of thousands of dollars, Grabe points out now, her laughter tinged with irony.</p>
<p>Strikingly, Grabe noted that the social transformation wasn't rooted in the economic value of the land, most of which was not productive agricultural land. Rather than greater economic well-being, owning property gave the women greater status&#8212;personal and social.</p>
<p>The women in Nicaragua were organizing at a grassroots level to enforce property-rights laws that had been on the books since the 1979 revolution. "It's not unlike pay-equity laws in the United States," noted Grabe. "The law can be on the books but nobody follows it."</p>
<p>Using land ownership as a structural indicator of gender inequity, Grabe documented a greater sense of "agency" among women property owners. "It shifts the gender ideology and changes assumptions about women's roles," she said. "Women talk about themselves differently, and husbands respect their wives more."</p>
<p>As a social psychologist, Grabe explores the links between social and political conditions that determine how, why, and under what circumstances resistance emerges. If her career path had unfolded more traditionally, Grabe said she might have chosen sociology rather than psychology, which takes an "individual focus rather than a structural one" to phenomena like domestic violence. But social psychology allows her to focus on the impact of social structures on individuals, and she has carved out a niche for herself in what she calls the "sub field" of feminist psychology.</p>
<p>"That's why UC Santa Cruz was such a perfect fit for me," she said. "Nobody else would hire a psychologist looking at land use! The department gave me a long leash and said 'Go for it.' "</p>
<p>Grabe has overcome challenges in the field, including the language barrier. She doesn't speak Spanish well enough to conduct in-depth interviews, so she hired local women, which is in keeping with her commitment to participatory research.</p>
<p>"I was upfront about my shortcomings&#8212;I don't speak Spanish, I don't have expertise in Latin American history or politics, and I don't have a background in feminist studies," she said. But what she brought to the project was a determination to "follow" the grassroots activists and document their work, letting them set the agenda rather than impose her own research program on the community.</p>
<p>Word of her scholarship, and her research approach, has traveled around the globe. Members of a grassroots organization in Tanzania engaged in a similar land-rights effort reached out to Grabe, who has documented reductions in violence against women there, too&#8212;despite significant cultural differences, including a pastoral system and polygamy.</p>
<p>A year ago, Grabe published <em>Narrating a Psychology of Resistance: Voices of the Compa&#241;eras in Nicaragua </em>(Oxford University Press, 2016), which presents first-hand accounts from members of the Nicaraguan women's movement.</p>
<p>"Humans are complex beings, and our psychological responses to sociopolitical oppression can lead to gendered justice that brings about lasting social change," said Grabe. "It's important to recognize and understand that phenomenon if we want a more just and equitable world."</p>
<p>In November, Grabe followed that book with the edited volume, <em>Women's Human Rights: A Social Psychological Perspective on Resistance, Liberation, and Justice </em>(Oxford University Press, 2017)<em>. </em>Contributing authors, including Grabe's colleague Heather Bullock, a professor of psychology who specializes in economic justice, write about violations of women's human rights that occur around the world&#8212;rape, sexual orientation, homelessness, civic participation, violence&#8212;to highlight the relevance of psychology to the defense of women's rights.</p>
<p>The book represents a "radically different approach to women's rights" than the typical legal framework, Grabe writes in the introduction. By using social psychological theory as a framework to defend women's human rights, it provides a path to understand how violations operate&#8212;and, importantly, offers strategies that extend beyond changing laws or monitoring international human rights treaties.</p>
<p>As a "scholar-activist," Grabe takes satisfaction in having documented the ways in which women working at the grassroots level have resisted marginalization and implemented social change. Demonstrating the efficacy and transformational power of their work has been personally and professionally gratifying, and she looks forward to growing the community of scholars who are building what she calls a "feminist psychology of resistance."</p>

Garcia-Luna-Aceves has been appointed to serve as the UC Santa Cruz director for CITRIS (Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society) and the Banatao Institute, effective July 1. Garcia-Luna-Aceves is the Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">As the CITRIS-UC Santa Cruz director, Garcia-Luna-Aceves will be responsible for directing operations and ensuring that the CITRIS mission is carried out at the campus level. As a major contribution, and in collaboration with the other campuses, Garcia-Luna-Aceves said he hopes to launch a new CITRIS initiative focusing on cyberphysical systems and the &#8220;Internet of Things.&#8221; His goal is to establish a research center headquartered at the UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Campus, which will include participation by the four UC CITRIS campuses&#8212;Berkeley, Davis, Merced, and Santa Cruz&#8212;and will integrate industry participation and sponsorship as key elements. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">We have several faculty members in the Baskin School of Engineering with considerable expertise in cyberphysical systems, data science, data and computer systems security, and what we now refer to as the &#8216;Internet of Things,&#8217;&#8221; Garcia-Luna-Aceves said. &#8220;Together, these faculty members, along with our colleagues on other CITRIS campuses, can find new approaches to computing and security that will ensure data is impervious to corrupted systems and malicious individuals.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Garcia-Luna-Aceves&#8217;s own research focuses on the principles of computer communication, wireless networking, mobile and pervasive computing, information-centric networks and cyberphysical networks. He said our society is at an inflection point in computing and that without a radical new approach to security, we are putting ourselves at an escalating risk for privacy breaches, fake news, and other serious security infractions. &#8220;We need to be able to trust the data, even if we can&#8217;t trust the participants or the container that holds the data,&#8221; he said. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Garcia-Luna-Aceves said he is looking forward to enhanced collaboration between UC Santa Cruz faculty and colleagues across the CITRIS organization, not only through a new initiative, but also through existing CITRIS initiatives, which include healthcare, human-centric robotics, sustainable infrastructure, and connecting communities through technology. </span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">We are happy to welcome Professor Garcia-Luna-Aceves to the leadership team,&#8221; said CITRIS director Costas Spanos. &#8220;CITRIS will benefit from his deep technical expertise as well as his knowledge of the Santa Cruz campus, to facilitate collaboration across the four CITRIS campuses and enhance research and student engagement for technology in the interest of society.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Garcia-Luna-Aceves said he sees CITRIS as an amplifying force. The combined expertise of four UC campuses working together in conjunction with industry partners could lead to positive societal impact well beyond the sum of the individual parts.</span></span></p>
<p class="western">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The Baskin School of Engineering has established strong relationships with industry partners in Silicon Valley,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;Connecting the dots between UC Santa Cruz, Silicon Valley, and CITRIS will bring additional tangible benefits to the region and the state.&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">The presence of a UC Santa Cruz campus in Silicon Valley will further help to establish a CITRIS presence there, he said.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span size="3" style="font-size: medium;">Garcia-Luna-Aceves takes over from Patrick Mantey, who was the CITRIS campus director at UC Santa Cruz for more than 15 years. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to express my sincere gratitude to Pat for his service as the inaugural director of CITRIS at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Wolf said. &#8220;He is the longest-serving CITRIS director, and he cares deeply about the organization and its mission to create technology for the benefit of society.&#8221;</span></span></p>

<p>Finding a fawn (baby&#160;deer) alone in the woods or a meadow is fairly common. Many people assume that young wildlife found alone are abandoned, helpless and need assistance for their survival. In nearly all cases this is a mistake, and typically human interaction does more damage than good. If you see a fawn or other newborn wildlife, enjoy your encounter, but for the animal&#8217;s well being, it is important to keep the encounter brief and maintain some distance.</p>
<p>A fawn's best chance of survival lies in being raised by its mother. Fawns nurse three to four times a day, usually for less than thirty minutes at a time, but otherwise the doe keeps her distance. This helps reduce the chances that she will attract a predator to the fawn. The fawn's protective coloration, near lack of scent and ability to remain motionless all help it avoid detection by predators and people.</p>
<p>If you find a fawn you should not approach it and by no means touch it or pick it up. The mother will most likely return to claim it. If you feel that the animal is in harms way, maintain a substantial distance while still being able to observe it and contact the&#160;<strong>campus police department 459-2231</strong>&#160;or&#160;<strong>county&#160;</strong><strong>Animal Control: <span color="#000000" style="color: #000000;">831-454-7227</span>.</strong></p>
<p>In addition to potentially harming a fawn, state and federal laws forbid possession of game and many non-game animals, so adopting newborn wildlife is usually illegal. If a fawn has been "rescued" when it shouldn't have been, it can often be released at the same location. Parents tend to remain in the area for at least a day, looking for the lost youngster.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s most innovative educators will offer insights and advice about fostering lively, dynamic, and relevant classrooms during a special edition of the </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Weekend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Teach-Ins.</span></p>
<a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/teach-in-with-citl-how-slugs-teach-and-learn-now-what-is-active-learning-and-why-does-it-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How Slugs Teach Now: What Is Active Learning And Why Does It Matter&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be the first Teach-In sponsored by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s new Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning (CITL), which is dedicated to revitalizing UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s teaching mission, while promoting equity and accessibility in the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century classroom. The talk takes place on Saturday, April 28, from 12:30 to 2 p.m. at Humanities Room 259. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzanne Alonzo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Daniel Press, professor of environmental studies and executive director of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), will discuss &#8220;How Social Behavior Can Save the World.&#8221; Psychology professors Christy Byrd and Rebecca Covarrubias will delve into &#8220;Place and Belonging in a UC Santa Cruz Education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz literature professor Jody Greene, CITL&#8217;s founding director, hopes the presentation sends a strong and positive message to returning Banana Slugs: &#8220;I wanted to let alumni know that we are putting energy into sustaining and revitalizing the teaching mission at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the teaching mission has been part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s DNA since the university opened in 1965, the campus has grown enormously, especially over the past 20 years, Greene continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That growth creates new opportunities as well as challenges. Classes are much larger than they used to be. While the student body is now much more reflective of California&#8217;s demographics than it was 50 years ago, and while students bring a wealth of cultural and life experiences campus, many undergraduates face serious barriers to completing their education. Some are first-generation students, for example&#8212;students who are the first in their family to attend a four-year university. Some are undocumented, or facing economic, cognitive and emotional challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of these changes, UC Santa Cruz educators have been looking into ways to revisit and refine teaching methods that support learning while taking full advantage of the recent &#8220;outpouring&#8217;&#8217; of research into higher education, Greene said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She emphasized that professors must not take their pedagogical missions for granted. &#8220;Until recently, those of us who teach in higher education were able to do so without pedagogical training,&#8221; Greene said. &#8220;In the past, you could teach college without such training.&#8221;&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, there has been a dramatic shift, with professors learning from new studies in cognitive dynamics, as well as surveys and information designed to make classrooms more impactful, relevant, and engaging. At the same time, educators have embraced the potential&#8212;as well as the distractions&#8212;of high-tech equipment such as laptops and a new generation of more interactive cellular phones. &#8220;Those devices change us socially and neurocognitively,&#8221; Greene said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fittingly, the Teach-In itself, focusing on interactive learning, will be a dynamic experience for returning alumni. Greene wanted an alternative to a group of professors &#8220;standing up, giving a lecture to alumni, and then they nod and smile and maybe ask a question at the end.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, alumni will see what active learning looks like. There will be a modest amount of lecturing, but also plenty of interactive activities. For instance, Press and Alonzo will showcase the way that social behavior helps people respond to climate issues by having their Teach-In &#8220;students&#8217;&#8217; try their hand at group problem-solving. Byrd and Covarrubias will use exercises to show how a strong sense of place and belonging supports student learning. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni will have a chance to share their own recollections about place and community while attending UC Santa Cruz&#8212;and their stories are sure to be instructive, Greene said. &#8220;If we can help students feel at home in this place, we give them a greater sense of belonging, which supports their educational success.&#8221; </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Teach-In is bound to be a powerful experience for all participants. Rather than sit back and absorb information, returning alumni &#8220;will have a chance to go to school in ways that we hope our students are going to school right now, with students taking control of their own learning, and engaging with one another,&#8221; Greene said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d06898968072701712b15d6e03bec9bb"><name>control-theory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Control theory symposium April 27 features leading academic and industry experts </title><summary>The Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz will host a regional symposium on Control Theory and Automation on Friday, April 27.</summary><keywords>CITRIS, Cyber-Physical Systems</keywords><start-date>1523948400000</start-date><display-name>Control theory symposium April 27 features leading academic and industry experts </display-name><path>/2018/04/control-theory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/control-theory</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1523914937381</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1523984780805</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/aj-krener-226.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/aj-krener-226.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aj-krener-226.jpg</name><display-name>aj-krener-226.jpg</display-name><file-size>40313</file-size><width>226</width><height>284</height></image><image-alt>Arthur Krener</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/citris-logo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/citris-logo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-logo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>citris-logo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18093</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>CITRIS logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Arthur Krener</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/pk-menon.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/pk-menon.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pk-menon.jpg</name><display-name>pk-menon.jpg</display-name><file-size>28956</file-size><width>226</width><height>286</height></image><image-alt>P.

The symposium will bring together the leading experts in control theory and automation from both academia and industry in Northern California.</p>
<p>The People and Robots Initiative of the <a href="http://citris-uc.org/"><span>Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Banatao Institute</span></a> joined with the <a href="https://cps.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span>Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center</span></a> at UC Santa Cruz to organize the symposium. It is the inaugural event for what is planned as an annual Northern California workshop for researchers working in the broad area of systems and control. Control theory is the basis of most of the electronic systems people rely on every day in machines and devices ranging from automobiles to mobile phones. The field is driving advances in areas such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and aerospace.</p>
<p>"Algorithms designed using control theory provide the intelligence needed to most systems of today, from autonomous cars to the internet," said Ricardo Sanfelice, associate professor of computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz and one of the symposium's faculty organizers. "By bringing together local experts from industry and academia, this symposium will focus on key challenges and future opportunities for the development of solutions to the control and automation problems faced today."</p>
<p>The symposium will feature two keynote speakers. <strong>P. K. Menon</strong>, chief scientist and chief executive of Optimal Synthesis, a high-technology aerospace research and development company, will give a talk on "Dynamics and Control of Air Traffic." <strong>Arthur Krener</strong>, who retired from UC Davis as a distinguished professor of mathematics in 2006 and is currently a research professor of applied mathematics at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, will discuss "Computational Issues in Nonlinear Control and Estimation."</p>
<p>The event also includes a panel with systems and control experts from academia and industry discussing current challenges and emerging trends, presentations by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a poster and networking session.</p>
<p>The topics of interest in the symposium are automation, systems, and control theory, along with their applications in and intersections with devices, hardware architecture, machine learning, networking, optimization, and robotics. One goal of the event is to spark discussions around questions such as: What are the key challenges in the development of control and automation solutions to the complex problems of today? What are unique future opportunities and problems where control and automation would play a key role?</p>

<p>"We talked with over 500 renters in Watsonville and Freedom, and two-thirds are spending more than 30 percent of their household income on rent and utilities," said UC Santa Cruz Sociology Professor Steve McKay. "On top of that, overcrowding is a real problem."</p>
<p>University researchers and community leaders will host a public forum about the affordable housing crisis on Wednesday, May 2, at 7 p.m. in the Community Room of the Watsonville Civic Center. The program will be conducted in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>The forum, "The South County Affordable Housing Crisis and Ways to Move Forward," will feature Watsonville Mayor Lowell Hurst; Fred Keeley of Affordable Housing Santa Cruz County; attorney Gretchen Regenhardt of California Rural Legal Assistance; UC Santa Cruz Sociology Professor Miriam Greenberg; student researchers; and McKay.</p>
<p>The forum will focus on sharing information about tenant rights and housing-related support, as well as a discussion with city and county leaders about local community action, policy options, and "steps forward."</p>
<p>Greenberg and McKay are cofounders of the <a href="http://noplacelikehomeucsc.org/en/">No Place Like Home</a> project at UC Santa Cruz, which has deployed more than 200 UCSC students over two years to survey 1,700 renters across Santa Cruz County. No Place Like Home has partnered with the Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County and Community Bridges to produce a detailed and revealing portrait of renters, including non-English speakers in South County.</p>
<p>The forum is being cosponsored by the UCSC Center for Labor Studies; the Department of Sociology; the Division of Social Sciences; the City of Watsonville; Community Bridges' La Manzana Community Resources program; the Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County; California Rural Legal Assistance; SEIU Local 251; Economic Justice Alliance; and Affordable Housing Santa Cruz County: The Housing Solutions Initiative.</p>

85 projects, including three at UC Santa Cruz, to support efforts to develop a comprehensive reference atlas of all cells in the human body</article-subhead><article-text><p>The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) has announced funding for three new projects at the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/"><span>UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</span></a> to support the <a href="https://www.humancellatlas.org/"><span>Human Cell Atlas</span></a>, a global effort to map every type of cell in the healthy human body as a resource for studies of health and disease. The UCSC projects are among 85 to receive new grants from CZI totaling $15 million over one year.</p>
<p>In addition to the three new projects, researchers at the Genomics Institute have been collaborating with partners in the United States and Europe to build the <a href="https://www.humancellatlas.org/data-sharing"><span>Data Coordination Platform</span></a> for the Human Cell Atlas. The <a href="https://www.chanzuckerberg.com/human-cell-atlas/comp-tools">new projects</a> are focused on developing open computational tools, algorithms, visualizations, and benchmark datasets to enable researchers around the globe to work with the large variety of molecular and imaging data being generated by the effort.</p>
<p>Two of the projects, led by research scientists Jingchun Zhu and Maximilian Haeussler, build on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s legacy of creating web-based browsers for the biological and medical research communities. Zhu, for example, leads a project to develop a single-cell browser for the visualization and exploration of Human Cell Atlas data.</p>
<p><strong>Xena Browser</strong></p>
<p>The Human Cell Atlas project aims to create a comprehensive reference map of all human cells through the collection and dissemination of diverse datasets obtained with state-of-the-art technologies for imaging and molecular analysis. Researchers will use the data to thoroughly characterize each cell type. Zhu's team plans to showcase this powerful dataset through <a href="http://xena.ucsc.edu/"><span>UCSC Xena</span></a>, a web-based tool for visualization, integration, and exploration of diverse genomics datasets and their associated metadata. Xena has an international user base and is a proven resource for showcasing important datasets for the larger scientific community.</p>
<p>"Our work will enable the exploration of the HCA datasets by the wider scientific community," Zhu said. "We look forward to working with CZI scientists, the Data Coordination Platform, and other awardees to display their results and data."</p>
<p>A related project led by Haeussler will build a web-based viewer for visualizing single-cell gene expression data and integrate it with the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/"><span>UCSC Genome Browser</span></a> and the Xena Browser. "There is no good web-based viewer available yet for single-cell expression data," Haeussler said.</p>
<p>The viewer will allow a visual comparison of large single-cell datasets in two dimensions, overlaying metadata, marker gene levels, and cell clustering information. These tools will be integrated into the popular UCSC Genome Browser to display Human Cell Atlas data linked from the gene and chromosome level. The researchers will build the software as a standalone component that is easy to integrate into other websites. Zhu's group plans to integrate it into the UCSC Xena Browser.</p>
<p><strong>Cell trajectories</strong></p>
<p>In the third project, Joshua Stuart, Baskin Professor of Biomolecular Engineering, will use CZI funding to develop a unified classification of cellular processes. His team will develop standards for describing "cell trajectories" found in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is used to study changes in gene expression over time by analyzing the RNA transcripts copied from active genes. Studying RNA-Seq data at the single-cell level promises new insights into cellular processes. Stuart's project includes developing methods to align cell trajectories, and tools to search known and novel cell differentiation transitions. Using these tools with Human Cell Atlas data will enable detailed comparisons of intermediate cell states within and across a variety of cellular processes.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next year, the grantees will work together and share progress to coordinate efforts and maximize the usability of these tools. Working with CZI's science and software engineering teams, they will work to bring these tools to the broader scientific community and, where appropriate, link them to the Human Cell Atlas <a href="https://www.humancellatlas.org/data-sharing"><span>Data Coordination Platform</span></a>.</p>
<p>The Human Cell Atlas is an international effort to create a shared, open reference atlas of all cells in the healthy human body as a resource for studies of both health and disease. The effort has been spearheaded by Aviv Regev at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Sarah Teichmann at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, co-chairs of the HCA Organizing Committee.</p>
<p>CZI is supporting the project in several ways&#8212;through funding to develop the Data Coordination Platform to facilitate open sharing of data produced for the HCA efforts, and through funding for 38 pilot projects to build new technologies, best practices, and data analysis techniques for the Human Cell Atlas. Recommended funding for the 85 new projects is the latest support CZI is providing toward this effort.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d4d9363e8072701712b15d6eab02aba3"><name>keynote-staff-engagement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Enhancing staff engagement</title><summary>Staff members play a central role in the mission of UC Santa Cruz, and it is vital that they feel valued and engaged.

This is important for staff retention, as well&#160;as for the success of our campus and the fundamental health of our community. It was, in fact, the importance of staff that inspired the reinstitution of the Campus Welfare Committee (CWC) last year and the charge that instructed this group to focus on ways to improve staff engagement.</p>
<h3>The work of the CWC</h3>
<p>CWC began by looking at the research on employee engagement to better understand what impacts it. The committee also reviewed the results of the last three UC employee engagement surveys. Compared to other campuses in the system, UC Santa Cruz has performed at or near the bottom on the level of engagement.</p>
<p>Four areas where UC Santa Cruz had statistically significant lower levels of performance were in the areas of engagement, career development, organizational change, and image/brand. In addition to reviewing the engagement survey findings, the committee invited members from the <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/human-resources/coro/2017_forms/2016-CORO-Projects-Northern-California-Final-Report.pdf">2016&#8211;17 CORO cohort</a>, which is a UC-wide leadership development program, to present the findings of their year-long study on diversity and inclusion across employees at UC. The committee felt the CORO findings would help provide additional context on the engagement of employees.</p>
<p>From this work, the CWC identified six categories to frame their exploration on engagement and the development of recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>community building</li>
<li>communication</li>
<li>workload</li>
<li>professional advancement</li>
<li>change management</li>
<li>training and mentorship</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to generate feedback to form recommendations in each of the six categories, the CWC conducted focus groups and sent out a campus survey. The CWC also sought feedback on activities already underway across the campus in the six categories.</p>
<p>As a result of this work the CWC identified a set of recommendations in the six categories of engagement. These recommendations consist of a mix of current best practices, enhanced communication about existing programs, and potential new initiatives and programs.</p>
<h3>Ways to learn more and provide feedback</h3>
<p>In order to share the recommendations, discuss actions underway and get feedback on the priorities for investment, we are hosting three staff listening sessions. They will take place at:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 a.m., May 4 in the Auditorium at the UC Santa Cruz Scotts Valley Center.&#160;</li>
<li>2 p.m., June 6 at the Stevenson Event Center at the UC Santa Cruz main campus.&#160;</li>
<li>3 p.m on June 26 in Room 2110 at the Silicon Valley Center.&#160;</li>
</ul>
<p>Each session will last one hour and is open to all staff. Members of the CWC and Staff Human Resources will be on hand to help facilitate the discussion and feedback.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Through 2018, the committee will continue its work into the next phase of activity, consisting of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitoring implementation of actions already underway,</li>
<li>Engaging with the campus community as to other recommendations that would require new programs, initiatives, or resources, and</li>
<li>Overseeing a task force charged with focusing on the development of a compensation philosophy. The lack of a locally articulated compensation philosophy can lead to confusion and negatively impact employee engagement and satisfaction. This task force will work to develop a campus compensation philosophy. During our listening sessions, we will review the charge of the compensation philosophy task force.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensuring we can enhance our employee engagement is a priority for the campus leadership team. Our employees and their contributions are valuable to our community. We hope that staff will join us for our listening sessions to discuss this very important aspect of our campus community.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d554ac9e8072701712b15d6ea980b64e"><name>casfs-plantsale</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spring Plant Sale Takes Place April 28-29</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden's Spring Plant Sale takes place Saturday, April 28 and Sunday, April 29, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the base of the UC Santa Cruz campus, near the intersection of Bay and High Streets.</summary><keywords>CASFS, plant, sale, spring</keywords><start-date>1523948400000</start-date><display-name>CASFS-Plant Sale</display-name><path>/2018/04/casfs-plantsale</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/casfs-plantsale</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1523997517890</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1523997612802</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Martha Brown</name><title></title><phone/><email>mtbrown@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/spring-sale-poster-18.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/spring-sale-poster-18.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>spring-sale-poster-18.jpg</name><display-name>spring-sale-poster-18.jpg</display-name><file-size>117367</file-size><width>275</width><height>421</height></image><image-alt>Plant sale poster</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/casfs-plantsale_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/casfs-plantsale_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>casfs-plantsale_80.jpg</name><display-name>casfs-plantsale_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>4713</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Plant sale poster</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Annual Spring Plant Sale offers a wide array of organically grown selections for the gardener and landscaper</article-subhead><article-text><p>The UCSC Farm &amp; Garden&#8217;s annual Spring Plant Sale welcomes gardeners with the region&#8217;s largest offering of organically grown vegetable, herb, and flower starts, along with a wide variety of landscape plants.</p>

Selected by the students as the title for the 2018 show, it refers to the historical moment and conditions that have shaped their work and lives.<br/><br/>"We are thrilled to be presenting this work as part of DANM's rich tradition of working at the intersection of the arts, humanities, sciences and technology," noted Robin Hunicke, acting director of the DANM program. <br/><br/>"Whether that's taking a hard look at how entertainment and social media impact our society, engaging in projects of civic participation and social justice, exploring race, representation and gender, or looking at the environmental impacts of the Anthropocene, DANM students present work that asks hard questions and inspires dialogue."<br/><br/>"Now, more than ever, it is so critical that the University provides students with the opportunity to explore how the digital impacts our lives,&#160;and to envision how we can approach technology as part of critical artistic practices," Hunicke added. "We're honored to host this event in the Digital Arts Research Center and invite the entire campus to come and participate." <br/><br/>The exhibition will be curated by John Weber, director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. He noted that the artists in this year&#8217;s exhibition embrace video, virtual reality, the internet, computer programming, photography, and digital fabrication as baseline tools and conditions for making art.&#8232;</p>
<p>"Like the DANM program, the students adopt a resolutely interdisciplinary stance and approach digital technology as a fundamental component of 21st century art, even as they insist on the freedom to work with analog media as needed," said Weber. <br/><br/>"Yet technology, however omnipresent, is not an end in itself. It is a means to speak about the social and natural worlds and be heard. There is hope here, along with skepticism, critique, anxiety, and fascination. This work testifies, if at times quietly, to the belief that art can challenge the world and should ultimately change it," he added. <br/><br/><strong>The projects in the exhibition</strong> include Lindsay Moffat&#8217;s "We Are All the Same But Different," a piece that explores the the systematic suffering of industrially-farmed animals. Exposing viewers to the realities of animal agriculture, it includes stop-motion animation, video footage of animals reared inside the factory farm system, plus an experiential, interactive installation component. <br/><br/>Simon Boas&#8217;s project, "No in Disguise" features videos of men reading transcripts of interviews with dating app users who express harmful attitudes toward women. He notes that his video "recombines the physical features of the readers into an endless procession, resembling every man and no man in particular."<br/><br/>And Tony Assi&#8217;s "Gaze Relations" illuminates the differences between people and computer vision algorithms in perceiving the body. He notes that "gaze tracking demonstrates the complexity of human perception in comparison with body-detection algorithms that reduce the body to simple patterns, revealing and contrasting the processes of human and machine vision."<br/><br/>Gallery hours for the show are noon to 5 p.m., April 27-29. Artists&#8217; talks with the students take place from 2 to 4 p.m. on Saturday, April 28, with a public reception following from 4 to 6 p.m. Admission is free and open to everyone.

The greatest impact is expected from 3&#8211;6 p.m.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Similar to 2017, we will have an increased law enforcement presence with additional UC police officers, as well as allied law enforcement agencies throughout the campus conducting enforcement activities. These officers will conduct enhanced patrols throughout the day, looking for individuals in violation of the law, including the possession of and/or using marijuana and alcohol or other drugs; drivers under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol; and will enforce distracting driving laws, unpermitted vending of any merchandise, food, water, services, or marijuana of any kind on the campus. Campus parking regulations will also be strictly enforced.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to these enforcement efforts, the <strong>Santa Cruz Area CHP will be conducting a DUI checkpoint near the west side of campus</strong>, aggressively seeking those who choose to drive under the influence. In 2017, we arrested two DUI drivers at the checkpoint, including one driver in possession of a firearm. Arrests for DUI by the UC Santa Cruz Police Department have risen. We also wrote numerous citations for marijuana violations and traffic related violations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Campus Loop and Metro bus service may be delayed. Traffic diversion measures may be instituted if needed to alleviate impacted areas. If driving a vehicle, be alert for increased pedestrian traffic on all roadways, as well as the signage indicating the presence of the DUI checkpoint.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are potentially serious consequences of choosing to attend. We ask that individuals consider the risks and possible criminal penalties. Individuals affiliated with the campus are also subject to sanctions by the Student Conduct Office or Human Resources.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As we continue to talk about the impacts of drugs and alcohol on this campus, and to the greater Santa Cruz community, it is also important to know the facts around Proposition 64 as it pertains to the recreational use of marijuana at UC Santa Cruz. You should know that:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Possession and/or use of marijuana in any form (edibles, plant, concentrated, vaporized, etc.) on the campus, or any university property is not legal.</li>
<li>Medical marijuana is not allowed on campus.</li>
<li>It is not legal for any person to smoke or ingest marijuana in a public place, both on and off campus.&#160; A citation could cost you up to $500 per violation when court fees are attached.</li>
<li>It is not legal to drive a vehicle or ride a bicycle impaired or under the influence of marijuana.</li>
<li>It is not legal to possess marijuana for sale, transport, import, furnish, or give away marijuana.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>We are committed to the health and safety of our community. We know that this can be a challenging day for our students who are substance free or who are trying to stay away from those using marijuana. As such, the Cove and SHOP teams are sponsoring <strong>The Other 420</strong> event at the Cove. More information can be found at <a href="http://shop.ucsc.edu">shop.ucsc.edu</a>.</div>

She was born on July 1, 1927 in Queens, New York and graduated from Forest Hills High School. A gifted student, Helen was awarded a full scholarship to Cornell University, studying psychology for two years before deciding ultimately to attend Queens College where she completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. From there she earned a masters degree in Philosophy of Education from New York University (NYU), and began her teaching career during the 1940s in the New York public school system. Helen would eventually pursue doctorates in both the Philosophy of Education at NYU and in Clinical Psychology at SDIU.<br/><br/>In the early 1950s, she met, fell in love and married a young artist, Newton Harrison. After moving to Florence in the 1950s with Newton and 2 young children, she co-founded a Montessori school, working closely with Mario Montessori, Maria&#8217;s nephew. Moving back to the Lower East Side of New York in the early 1960s with a family that now included four children and a well-traveled German shepherd, she threw herself into a cultural scene that merged the art world, the folk music world and the peace movement. She hosted concerts and Hootenannies to raise funds for the civil rights movement and other causes, befriending musicians ranging from the Clancy Brothers to Archie Shepp. She founded the Tompkins Square Peace Center. The group she helped put together included Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker, Dave McReynolds of the War Resisters League, Judith Malina and Julian Beck of the Living Theater, David Dellinger of the Pacifist Anarchist Group, Robert Gilmore from the American Friends Service Committee. She was the first New York coordinator for the Women&#8217;s Strike for Peace, a major force in the anti-war movement and a critical organization behind the 1964 Nuclear Test Ban treaty. <br/><br/>After Newton completed his master&#8217;s degree at Yale in 1965, they both were offered teaching positions at the University of New Mexico where Helen taught literature. In a state with a large marginalized Native American population, Helen set up special classes for Native American children, who often had to leave school to assist their families with harvesting. Helen developed a range of creative curricula that accommodated their lives while respecting their culture.<br/><br/>Two years later, when Newton was offered a faculty position in the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego, Helen was recruited to direct the UC Extension Division&#8217;s education programs, and found herself in line to become the first woman vice-chancellor in the history of the university. <br/><br/>In 1972 Helen resigned from UC Extension to pursue art full-time. The Harrisons eventually both secured faculty appointments in the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego and subsequently emeriti faculty appointments in the Art Department at UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>Helen found her true calling when she joined her life partner Newton Harrison as an ecological artist. In turn she became a noted feminist, lecturer, teacher, and mentor to hundreds of emerging artists from her base at UCSD and later UC Santa Cruz. Her nearly 50-year creative collaboration (as the Harrisons or Helen Mayer and Newton Harrison) quickly focused on explorations of life and living systems, opening up a new movement in the arts, &#8220;eco-art.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;What we have to be concerned about is what is happening to the entire planet,&#8221; said Helen of their work. &#8220;What we are concerned about is the survival of the people and all living things.&#8221;<br/><br/>Helen&#8217;s unbridled curiosity and ability to synthesize ideas across a broad range of disciplines was a critical aspect of their ability to engage ideas and systems at the highest level. In their master work, The Lagoon Cycle, which examines the power and function of estuarial lagoons from the laboratory to the great Pacific gyre, the narrative thread is an encounter between two characters, a &#8216;Lagoon Maker&#8217; and a &#8216;Witness&#8217;, whose dialog establishes the philosophical basis for the ecological argument in many later works. <br/> <br/>In her final years, Helen worked with Newton on Sagehen in the High Sierra: A Future Garden for The Center for the Study of the Force Majeure, a center they developed at UC Santa Cruz that brings together artists, scientists, engineers, planners, and visionaries to design ecosystem adaptation works in regions around the world that are nearing critical tipping points due to planetary warming.<br/><br/>The Harrisons&#8217; deep interest in involving&#160;people&#160;of the Washoe Tribe, who for thousands of years&#160;have called the Sagehen area and beyond their ancestral home, was essential to the project. The relationship evolved from a public meeting at the Nevada Museum of Art, where Helen addressed the meeting and asked for help. Tribal elder Benny Fillmore notes that it was the first time he&#8217;d been asked by anyone outside the tribe to collaborate on an art project.<br/><br/>Laura Fillmore, who met Helen in the course of working on Sagehen, wrote recently, &#8220;Today is the 4th day since her passing and I feel such tenderness towards her circles of friends and artists and especially am grateful for the teachings that came from her collaboration with Newton, her life mate in the deepest sense of the respect one has for couples who really can &#8216;be one another&#8217;. She taught us about&#160;'caring' because, she would say, it makes people shy when you talk about love. It will always be all about that love and her grace and elegance and eloquence as well.&#8221;<br/><br/>The Harrisons have been represented for the past 45 years by the Ronald Feldman Gallery in New York, joined recently by Various Small Fires in Los Angeles. Ron Feldman writes, &#8220;Helen's fierce dedication, compassion, and warmth is irreplaceable.&#8221; Their archives are housed at Stanford University.<br/><br/>Helen&#8217;s work lives on through Newton, who is actively continuing their work.<br/><br/>In addition to her husband, Helen is survived by their children, Steven (Cheryl) Harrison, Joshua (Laurie Stricks) Harrison, Gabriel (Maureen) Harrison, and Joy (Bryan Stubbs) Harrison, and grandchildren, Ashlee, Marshall, Joseph, Michael, Mackenzy, Ana Sofia, Julian, Silas and Ruby along with 4 great grandchildren and many nieces and nephews.<br/><br/>In lieu of flowers the family requests that people make donations to the Sierra Club in her name.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

graduate and undergraduate alums</article-subhead><article-text><p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Medicinal chemist Thomas Webb and physicist and entrepreneur Susanne Hering are being honored by the UC Santa Cruz Division of Physical and Biological Sciences (PBSci) as the recipients of the PBSci Distinguished Alumni Awards.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The division established the awards to honor graduates of the division who have gone on to extraordinary accomplishments in diverse fields and whose careers are characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service. The Physical and Biological Sciences Distinguished Alumni Awards will be presented annually to a former graduate student and a former undergraduate student.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Webb, who earned a Ph.D. in synthetic organic chemistry from UC Santa Cruz in 1980, is being honored for the impact of his work </span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">in basic science and drug discovery. He is currently the director of medicinal chemistry in the Center for Chemical Biology at SRI Biosciences, where he leads small-molecule drug discovery for cancer and influenza. His accomplishments include development of an innovative anti-tumor drug which will enter clinical trials in 2019.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Before joining SRI, Webb worked on discovery of new cancer therapeutics in the Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, where he held a senior faculty position and directed the high-throughput chemistry center. He has also held key positions at ChemBridge Corporation, Neurocrine Biosciences, Corvas International, and Genentech, Inc. An active inventor, Webb holds 32 U.S. patents. He has written two book chapters and 72 peer-reviewed publications, and he has served as a reviewer for more than 30 major scientific journals. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hering, the </span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">founder and president of </span></span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://aerosol.us/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Aerosol Dynamics</span></a></u></span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> in Berkeley</span></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, is being honored for</span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> her impact as both a scientist and a developer of novel instruments that are advancing atmospheric science. She entered UC Santa Cruz with the pioneer class in 1965 and graduated in 1969 with a joint major in physics and history. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;">&#8220;<span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Both inside and outside the classroom, Santa Cruz heightened my joy of learning and showed me the thrill in intellectual discovery,&#8221; Hering said. &#8220;UCSC gave me the idealism and the academic background to pursue an unusual career, and enabled me to focus on one specific, small way in which I felt I might contribute to a better world.&#8221; </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hering continued her education at the University of Washington, earning a Ph.D. in low temperature physics in 1974. She studied atmospheric aerosols as a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology and continues to focus her research on the fine airborne particles that create haze in the atmosphere. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In 1991, Hering founded Aerosol Dynamics to develop effective methods to measure and characterize these particles. She and her team have developed a host of new measurement techniques that have been broadly used in air quality monitoring and research. They are currently working on a miniature system that could be worn or deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Hering</span><span color="#222222" style="color: #222222;"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> is a past-president of the American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR), a founding AAAR Fellow, and a recipient of AAAR&#8217;s Benjamin Y.

<p>The conference will bring together U.S. and Canadian recipients of the <a href="http://www.rightlivelihoodaward.org/">Right Livelihood Award</a>. Dubbed the "Alternative Nobel Prize," the award was established in 1980 "to honor and support courageous people and organizations offering visionary and exemplary solutions to the root causes of global problems." Presented annually in Stockholm, the annual award is usually shared by four recipients, or laureates, who are nominated through a process that is open to all.</p>
<p>McKibben and Ellsberg will be joined by 15 other laureates for the first North American Regional Conference. It will take place at UC Santa Cruz, which in 2013 was designated the first <a href="https://kresge.ucsc.edu/commonground/rlc/rlc-press-release.html">Right Livelihood College</a> in North America.</p>
<p>"Kresge College is excited and honored to host this historic conference, which creates a space for these extraordinary leaders to collaborate and find dialogue with our own community," said Ben Leeds Carson, an associate professor of music and provost of UCSC's Kresge College. "The <span>Common Ground Center</span> at Kresge College is dedicated to education and activism about human rights, cooperative economies, and the protection of diverse, sustainable ecologies. When you add Kresge&#8217;s broader commitments to service-centered education, media literacy, and the free press, this conference promises to ignite powerful new possibilities both locally and internationally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The public is invited to attend free events, including a day-long teach-in with laureates. Seating at all events is limited and <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=3028&amp;cid=5548">advance registration</a> is requested.

<p>The barn won technology awards from the Golden Gate Chapter and Region X of <a href="mailto:https://www.ashrae.org/">ASHRAE</a>, a 56,000-member organization that represents heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration professionals. The project also received an honorable mention in the national ASHRAE competition.</p>
<p>The Hay Barn, a certified <a href="https://www.usgbc.org/projects/ucsc-haybarn">LEED-2009 Gold</a> building, has previously received honors from <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/12/barn-award.html">architects</a>, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/10/casfs-barn.html">preservationists</a>, and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/01/casfs-barn.html">woodworkers</a>.</p>
<p>The restoration of the dilapidated historic structure incorporated <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/hay-barn-raising.html">period construction techniques</a> from the 1860s. Now home to the headquarters of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), the barn is a multi-use facility that has become a popular site for campus and community gatherings, weddings, and special events. The restoration, which was completed in <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/barn-dedication.html">September 2015</a>, was made possible by a $5 million grant from the Helen and Will Webster Foundation. Architect Richard Fernau (BA, philosophy, '69) led the project.</p>
<p>The ASHRAE awards recognize the Hay Barn's energy-conservation systems, which include a passive natural ventilation cooling strategy rather than air conditioning. In addition, the building's well-insulated "envelope"&#8212;the roof, walls, and floor&#8212;was constructed to minimize the flow of air, water, and heat; skylights and windows were placed strategically; and a highly efficient heating-only ventilation system was installed. Other notable features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A zone-controlled, in-slab, all-electric radiant heating system that circulates hot water through the exposed concrete floor.</li>
<li>Highly insulated roofs, walls, and windows that lower heat loss.</li>
<li>Large barn doors, windows, and skylights that provide cross ventilation and give occupants hands-on control of the indoor environment, while also minimizing repair and maintenance costs.</li>
<li>A high-efficiency, occupant-controlled LED lighting system, modeled and specified by Assistant Energy Manager Sarah Gilchrist, that provides quality lighting with minimal energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>"The Hay Barn project is a perfect blend of innovation and restraint," said Patrick Testoni, campus energy manager. "We integrated simple but reliable systems into this historic structure, but we were restrained, too&#8212;avoiding big, complicated systems in favor of taking advantage of our mild climate."</p>
<p>Leveraging local wind and weather patterns meant designers could rely on simpler heating and ventilation systems, which also blend in with the site ecology; the Hay Barn is located in the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2007/05/1271.html">Cowell Lime Works Historic District</a>.</p>
<p>The Hay Barn's energy systems have earned rave reviews from users, as well.</p>
<p>"Whether we have a small group of staff working in the office or a very large wedding party, there's great air flow, and it's relatively easy to get the place warm or cool, as circumstances dictate," said CASFS Executive Director Daniel Press. "The energy systems operate very much in the background, out of sight and quietly, so we can focus on our work and the beautiful aesthetics of the barn itself."</p>
<p>The goals of the renovation were to maintain the historic nature of the building, dramatically increase its comfort, and reduce energy use to the point that its consumption could be offset by a new central campus photovoltaic array. After two years of operation, the barn uses only about one-fifth the average energy typically used by 50 university buildings in the state, according to the campus's ASHRAE award submission. An added benefit of the simple mechanical systems that were used is that the cost was only $25 per square foot&#8212;about half of the normal industry standard in the region, according to the campus award submission.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e00319d28072701712b15d6eea4a59ca"><name>deep-learning-galaxies</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Face recognition for galaxies: Artificial intelligence brings new tools to astronomy</title><summary>A 'deep learning' algorithm trained on images from cosmological simulations has been surprisingly successful at classifying real galaxies in Hubble images.</summary><keywords>Joel Primack, David Koo, VELA Simulations, CANDELS</keywords><start-date>1524492000000</start-date><display-name>Face recognition for galaxies: Artificial intelligence brings new tools to astronomy</display-name><path>/2018/04/deep-learning-galaxies</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/deep-learning-galaxies</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1524176721304</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1524495217563</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/galaxy-images-750.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/galaxy-images-750.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>galaxy-images-750.jpg</name><display-name>galaxy-images-750.jpg</display-name><file-size>187064</file-size><width>750</width><height>762</height></image><image-alt>images of simulated and real galaxies</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/galaxy-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/galaxy-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>galaxy-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>galaxy-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14428</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image of simulated galaxy</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>A 'deep learning' algorithm trained on images from cosmological simulations is surprisingly successful at classifying real galaxies in Hubble images. <strong>Top row:</strong> High-resolution images from a computer simulation of a young galaxy going through three phases of evolution (before, during, and after the "blue nugget" phase). <strong>Middle row:</strong> The same images from the computer simulation of a young galaxy in three phases of evolution as it would appear if observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. <strong>Bottom row:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope images of distant young galaxies classified by a deep learning algorithm trained to recognize the three phases of galaxy evolution.

<p>In a new study, accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal</em> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07307.pdf">available online</a>, researchers used computer simulations of galaxy formation to train a deep learning algorithm, which then proved surprisingly good at analyzing images of galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p>The researchers used output from the simulations to generate mock images of simulated galaxies as they would look in observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. The mock images were used to train the deep learning system to recognize three key phases of galaxy evolution previously identified in the simulations. The researchers then gave the system a large set of actual Hubble images to classify.</p>
<p>The results showed a remarkable level of consistency in the neural network's classifications of simulated and real galaxies.</p>
<p>"We were not expecting it to be all that successful. I'm amazed at how powerful this is," said coauthor Joel Primack, professor emeritus of physics and a member of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UC Santa Cruz. "We know the simulations have limitations, so we don't want to make too strong a claim. But we don't think this is just a lucky fluke."</p>
<p>Galaxies are complex phenomena, changing their appearance as they evolve over billions of years, and images of galaxies can provide only snapshots in time. Astronomers can look deeper into the universe and thereby "back in time" to see earlier galaxies (because of the time it takes light to travel cosmic distances), but following the evolution of an individual galaxy over time is only possible in simulations. Comparing simulated galaxies to observed galaxies can reveal important details of the actual galaxies and their likely histories.</p>
<p><strong>Blue nuggets</strong></p>
<p>In the new study, the researchers were particularly interested in a phenomenon seen in the simulations early in the evolution of gas-rich galaxies, when big flows of gas into the center of a galaxy fuel formation of a small, dense, star-forming region called a "blue nugget." (Young, hot stars emit short "blue" wavelengths of light, so blue indicates a galaxy with active star formation, whereas older, cooler stars emit more "red" light.)</p>
<p>In both simulated and observational data, the computer program found that the "blue nugget" phase only occurs in galaxies with masses within a certain range. This is followed by quenching of star formation in the central region, leading to a compact "red nugget" phase. The consistency of the mass range was an exciting finding, because it suggests the deep learning algorithm is identifying on its own a pattern that results from a key physical process happening in real galaxies.</p>
<p>"It may be that in a certain size range, galaxies have just the right mass for this physical process to occur," said coauthor David Koo, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The researchers used state-of-the-art galaxy simulations (the VELA simulations) developed by Primack and an international team of collaborators, including Daniel Ceverino (University of Heidelberg), who ran the simulations, and Avishai Dekel (Hebrew University), who&#160;led analysis and interpretation of them and developed new physical concepts based on them. All such simulations are limited, however, in their ability to capture the complex physics of galaxy formation.</p>
<p>In particular, the simulations used in this study did not include feedback from active galactic nuclei (injection of energy from radiation as gas is accreted by a central supermassive black hole). Many astronomers consider this process to be an important factor regulating star formation in galaxies. Nevertheless, observations of distant, young galaxies appear to show evidence of the phenomenon leading to the blue nugget phase seen in the simulations.</p>
<p><strong>CANDELS<br/></strong></p>
<p>For the observational data, the team used images of galaxies obtained through the CANDELS project (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey), the largest project in the history of the Hubble Space Telescope. First author Marc Huertas-Company, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory and Paris Diderot University, had already done pioneering work applying deep learning methods to galaxy classifications using publicly available CANDELS data.</p>
<p>Koo, a CANDELS co-investigator, invited Huertas-Company to visit UC Santa Cruz to continue this work. Google has provided support for their work on deep learning in astronomy through gifts of research funds to Koo and Primack, allowing Huertas-Company to spend the past two summers in Santa Cruz, with plans for another visit in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>"This project was just one of several ideas we had," Koo said. "We wanted to pick a process that theorists can define clearly based on the simulations, and that has something to do with how a galaxy looks, then have the deep learning algorithm look for it in the observations. We're just beginning to explore this new way of doing research. It's a new way of melding theory and observations."</p>
<p>For years, Primack has been working closely with Koo and other astronomers at UC Santa Cruz to compare his team's simulations of galaxy formation and evolution with the CANDELS observations. "The VELA simulations have had a lot of success in terms of helping us understand the CANDELS observations," Primack said. "Nobody has perfect simulations, though. As we continue this work, we will keep developing better simulations."</p>
<p>According to Koo, deep learning has the potential to reveal aspects of the observational data that humans can't see. The downside is that the algorithm is like a "black box," so it is hard to know what features in the data the machine is using to make its classifications. Network interrogation techniques can identify which pixels in an image contributed most to the classification, however, and the researchers tested one such method on their network.</p>
<p>"Deep learning looks for patterns, and the machine can see patterns that are so complex that we humans don't see them," Koo said. "We want to do a lot more testing of this approach, but in this proof-of-concept study, the machine seemed to successfully find in the data the different stages of galaxy evolution identified in the simulations."</p>
<p>In the future, he said, astronomers will have much more observational data to analyze as a result of large survey projects and new telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope. Deep learning and other machine learning methods could be powerful tools for making sense of these massive datasets.</p>
<p>"This is the beginning of a very exciting time for using advanced artificial intelligence in astronomy," Koo said.</p>
<p>In addition to Primack, Koo, and Huertas-Company, the coauthors of the paper include Avishai Dekel at Hebrew University in Jerusalem (and a visiting researcher at UC Santa Cruz); Sharon Lapiner at Hebrew University; Daniel Ceverino at University of Heidelberg; Raymond Simons at Johns Hopkins University; Gregory Snyder at Space Telescope Science Institute; Mariangela Bernardi and H. Dominquez Sanchez at University of Pennsylvania; Zhu Chen at Shanghai Normal University; Christoph Lee at UC Santa Cruz; and Berta Margalef-Bentabol and Diego Tuccillo at the Paris Observatory.</p>
<p>In addition to support from Google, this work was partly supported by grants from France-Israel PICS, US-Israel Binational Science Foundation, U.S. National Science Foundation, and Hubble Space Telescope.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s graduate student alumni are making their way in the world, curating exhibits, helming research labs, holding academic chairs, and pursuing private clinical practice. Outstanding scholars with advanced degrees from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s academic divisions have found ways to leave their mark, making use of the rigorous training they received on campus. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">During this month&#8217;s </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Weekend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celebrations (April 27&#8211;29), the five recipients of this year&#8217;s Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni Award will be at UC Santa Cruz to inspire current and alumni graduate students. They will share career and life advice during the </span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/graduate-student-alumni-career-paths-panel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Graduate Student Alumni Career Paths Panel,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which takes place Friday, April 27, at 10 a.m. in the </span><a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu/content/directions-stevenson-fireside-lounge"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson Fireside Lounge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni Award Luncheon follows the Career Paths Panel, at which the graduates will be honored by their respective academic divisions. The five graduate alumni honorees and the academic divisions they represent include the following:</span></p>
<strong>Rachel Nelson, curator and program manager, Institute of the Arts and Sciences (IAS), UC Santa Cruz. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distinguished graduates travel the world for prestigious job offers, but some find their dream jobs right on campus. One prime example is Rachel Nelson, who earned her Ph.D. in 2016 in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Visual Studies program. Aside from her role at the IAS, Nelson teaches in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department at UC Santa Cruz. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Nelson came to UC Santa Cruz as a graduate student in 2010, she was part of the first cohort in the Visual Studies Ph.D. program, which was brand new at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson was excited to join the program because of its intellectual heft and interdisciplinary philosophy. &#8220;The department also encouraged me to take&#160;classes outside of the department and think about my work in context of the larger university and the larger world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A diverse group of scholars pushed me to reckon with art&#8217;s relationships with geopolitics, which has had a lasting effect on my work.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson said that her training in the Visual Studies program launched her career at the IAS. &#8220;This has allowed me great opportunities to build the program and develop new exhibitions and arts programming that draws on my understanding and experience of the strengths of interdisciplinary research at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelson is planning a nationally touring exhibition about the prison-industrial complex for the fall of 2019. This project will draw on UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s scholarship and activism, including work done on prison abolition by UC Santa Cruz humanities professor emerita Angela Davis and the research on the psychological effects of incarceration and solitary confinement by UC Santa Cruz psychology professor Craig Haney. &#8220;The exhibition will feature artists working nationally whose&#160;voices speak powerfully about the prison-industrial complex and its links to racism in our country,&#8221; Nelson said. </span></p>
<p><strong>Naomi J. Andrews, associate professor of history at Santa Clara University</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had a comprehensive educational experience at UC Santa Cruz, where she earned a B.A. in history in 1988, an M.A. in history in 1993, and a Ph.D. in history in 1998. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am so pleased to receive this honor from UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Andrews said. &#8220;The history department was my intellectual training ground as both an undergraduate and eventually as a graduate student, beginning with an upper-division class on Russian intellectual history with Jonathan Beecher in the spring of my first year of college.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrews trained to be a rigorous researcher. At the same time, her professors gave her a vivid sense of what excellent teaching looked like, creating a template for her future classrooms. &#8220;I received enthusiastic encouragement to pursue my own questions, wherever they led,&#8221; Andrews said. &#8220;My career at UC Santa Cruz traversed the change in the university from its early primary focus on undergraduate education to the expansion of graduate programs in the &#8217;90s.&#8221;</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she was an undergraduate, almost all of her instruction was from faculty rather than graduate students. The classes were small, and many were run as seminars. &#8220;And we still had only narrative evaluations!&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, &#8220;Santa Cruz is still home in so many ways, and my career as a historian and professor at Santa Clara University has been fundamentally shaped by my experiences as a student at all levels in the History Department and the university as a whole,&#8221; Andrews said. &#160;&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Thomas R. Webb, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">director of medicinal chemistry in the Center for Chemical Biology at SRI Biosciences, leads small-molecule drug discovery for cancer and influenza. His accomplishments include development of an innovative anti-tumor drug, which will enter clinical trials in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webb</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">earned his chemistry Ph.D. from UC Santa Cruz in 1980. He said receiving the Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni Award from UC Santa Cruz has inspired him to dedicate himself to scholarship and applications of medicinal chemistry with renewed energy and focus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, Webb considers his experience as a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry as some of the best years of his life, though he did not realize this at the time. He credits professors John McMurry, Phil Crews, Todd Wipke, and Harry Noller for inspiring him with their broad expertise, scholarship, and research focus on synthetic chemistry, natural product chemistry, computational chemistry, and RNA molecular biology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I directly credit my training here at UC Santa Cruz with the establishment of the standards of scholastic excellence that I have relied on throughout my career,&#8221; Webb said. &#8220;My love for organic chemistry, a fascination with the chemical biology of RNA, applied computation chemistry, and an appreciation of the importance of natural products have led me to where I am now; all of this is built on the foundation of the training I was fortunate to receive while at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that this prestigious honor has given him a renewed sense of purpose. &#8220;Any future success that I may have will be fueled by the encouragement that this award has given me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before joining SRI, Webb worked on discovery of new cancer therapeutics in the Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital, where he held a senior faculty position and directed the high-throughput chemistry center. </span></p>
<strong>Diane Bridgeman, a licensed clinical psychologist with a private practice in Santa Cruz,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holds a Ph.D. in psychology from UC Santa Cruz. She is honored to be recognized among the other Graduate Student Alumni honorees. &#8220;I deeply value my experiences at UC Santa Cruz, which helped to develop and strengthen my life philosophy of attempting to understand the mysteries and magic of mind and behavior, the questioning of why everyone isn&#8217;t a social justice advocate, and an appreciation for the haunting and inspiring effects of music.&#8221;</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridgeman was also drawn to UC Santa Cruz because of her lifelong commitment to social equity. &#8220;From childhood puzzlement as to why children teased and bullied each other, to horror around the inexplicable Vietnam war, to the injustices of the civil rights atrocities, I honed a strong sense of social justice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her lessons from UC Santa Cruz served her well. Bridgeman has maintained a clinical psychology practice for over 20 years. She also gives keynote addresses and workshops. Bridgeman has been honored with several awards from psychological associations and from the American Red Cross, where she is a volunteer manager. They recognized her with both the Professional Hero Award and Sisters in Service Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridgeman has held committee chairs with both the California Psychological Association and the American Psychological Association, and is a past president of the Monterey Bay Psychological Association. She currently chairs its Public Service/Education &amp; Outreach Committee, and co-chairs its Disaster Mental Health Response Committee.</span></p>
<p><strong>Randal Chilton Burns, professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, earned his M.S. in 1997 and his Ph.D. in 2000 from the Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Cruz. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, Burns said that his time at UC Santa Cruz &#8220;placed me on a journey to build the data systems used to make discoveries in physics, fluids, and neuroscience. I have gotten to work at universities, in corporate research, and at national labs with the best scientists in the world. I am humbled by my peers and collaborators and humbled to be recognized as a Distinguished Alumnus.&#8221;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Burns completed his Ph.D. working with Professor Darrell Long researching delta compression and storage system performance. He earned his B.S. from the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University.</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burns&#8217;s research focuses on the management, performance, and security of large data sets for scientific applications.&#160;His current focus is to build scalable systems that support neuroscience imaging analysis and annotation with the goal of reverse engineering the neurophysiology of mammalian brains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1990s, when Burns was pursuing his graduate degrees, computer science at UC Santa Cruz was both deeply connected with, and yet in stark contrast to, the internet boom, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Curious souls with a desire to solve the hardest problems collected at the edge of the dot-coms.&#160; My peers from that era have gone on to transform computational biology and&#160;computer systems and networks at top universities around the world.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f3fc74f58072701712b15d6e5d4278bf"><name>kzsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Making airwaves</title><summary>Celebrating 50 years of broadcasting, KZSC continues to offer homegrown programming to the greater Monterey Bay region.

The station will have a number of Alumni Weekend events to celebrate the milestone. </article-subhead><article-text><p>When Kavya Aswadhati first heard of the ICE raids in the Beach Flats neighborhood of Santa Cruz, she immediately thought of all the people she&#8217;d gotten to know working in the community garden and she placed a phone call.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke to a family who had the door broken down at 4 a.m., whose children stood out in the cold while agents went through their home,&#8221; Aswadhati said. &#8220;We got them on the air and that&#8217;s important because those voices aren&#8217;t being heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aswadhati serves as a news director for the fledgling local news program at <a href="https://www.kzsc.org/">KZSC</a>, the student-run radio station at UC Santa Cruz. But like many people at the radio station, she wears many hats, DJing for music programs, producing or participating in various talk radio programs, and filling in where needed.</p>
<p>But the news program in particular is a point of pride for the students who run the radio station&#8212;February marked its one-year anniversary.</p>
<p>&#8220;We try and tell stories about the entire Monterey Bay,&#8221; said Morgan Corona, the station manager at KZSC and a third-year student. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about the campus or the westside of Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>KZSC, 88.1 on the FM radio dial, broadcasts 20,000 watts, which sends its signal across three counties&#8212;Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito&#8212;and to cities like Watsonville and Salinas. The signal can even be heard in King City, more than 90 miles from campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Day one we get our reporters trained on the editing software, give them the equipment they need, and we put them on a story,&#8221; Corona said.</p>
<p>Right now, the station produces enough stories for a 10-minute segment every Thursday at 8 a.m. Considering the time and care it takes to produce every minute of a quality radio news story Corona, Aswadhati, and others are satisfied with the current output but have an eye on expansion, hoping to add another full slate on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing an all-volunteer, nonprofit newsroom is a delicate process,&#8221; said KZSC broadcast adviser Keith Rozendal. &#8220;And at KZSC, just as people build up enough experience to serve as news editors and trainers for the next generation, they tend to graduate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rozendal earned a Ph.D. in social and political psychology from UC Santa Barbara and has volunteered at college and community radio stations in Texas, California, and Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>Given that KZSC is 100 percent student-run, Rozendal facilitates the work of the 24-person governing board that is duly elected on an annual basis.</p>
<p>So Corona is not merely the student figurehead, but runs the station through the governing board&#8212;fellow students who help her manage the various unwieldy aspects of a radio station that is broadly popular within the community as well as the friendly confines of the campus.</p>
<p>Her team analyzes the $250,000 budget, sets the program schedule every quarter, and leads all the fundraising to keep the programs running while managing quality control on every front. KZSC raised more than $70,000 in donations last year, a record for the station. Among student-run groups on campus, KZSC generates the most gifts by far.</p>
<p>But along with celebrating a year for the news station, KZSC is also preparing to celebrate 50 years of student-run broadcasting during Alumni Weekend in late April.</p>
<p>Created in 1968, just three years after the university itself was founded, KZSC was initially called KRUZ. The studios were in the basement of Stevenson College dormitories. The station&#8217;s studios had relocated to the Communications Building on Science Hill by the time the FCC gave the station a toehold on the FM radio band, with a 10 watt signal at 88.1 FM. The studios moved to its current location above Crown College in 1980 and starting broadcasting at 10,000 watts in 2002 before amping up to its current 20,000 watts in 2007.</p>
<p>But along with celebrating its technical evolution that has facilitated the station&#8217;s broad reach on California&#8217;s Central Coast, KZSC is reaching out to alumni and collect the stories of the innumerable students that passed the radio station&#8212;and its unique student-run culture&#8212;from one year to the next down through the decades.</p>
<p>&#8220;We keep discovering amazing things about the people who passed through these doors, who helped make KZSC into something special,&#8221; Rozendal said as he digs through several boxes of fading paper files.</p>
<p>Those unorganized records have gradually yielded a directory of KZSC alumni, who have been invited back to the station&#8217;s 50th Anniversary celebration&#8212;set for Alumni Weekend April 27&#8211;29.</p>
<p>Throughout the weekend, alumni programmers will <a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/kzsc-alumni-airchecks-open-house/">return to the airwaves</a> to spin some classics and share personal reflections about their glory days on the air. KZSC takes over the Quarry Amphitheater at 7 p.m. on April 28 to present a live radio variety show featuring personalities, artists, and other creative types who were part of the 50-year history of student radio at UCSC. It&#8217;s a free event, open to the public to celebrate KZSC&#8217;s mission and history.

<p>This new department, part of Business and Administrative Services, is comprised of Real Estate Services, Physical &amp; Environmental Planning Services, Design &amp; Construction Services, Engineering Services, Physical Plant Services, and a Construction Projects Business Office. It is led by Associate Vice Chancellor Traci Ferdolage.</p>
<p>As a newly merged organization, PPDO&#8217;s focus is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve delivery of services by increasing overall responsiveness;</li>
<li>Enhance communication at all levels of the organization and with the campus;</li>
<li>Develop clear processes to improve transparency and efficiency; and</li>
<li>Ensuring use of resources are prioritized based on overarching campus priorities while considering total lifecycle cost of ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p>The different units within PPDO lead efforts to serve the campus and its facility and infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>Real Estate Services delivers services associated with managing the complex leases and licenses associated with conducting campus business. This unit also manages campus land records and serves as a commercial advisor and manager for campus real estate matters.</p>
<p>Physical &amp; Environmental Planning Services is responsible for overall planning associated with campus land use and the implementation of its capital plan and other construction projects. This unit is also responsible for the development, management and implementation of the Long Range Development Plan and Campus Physical Design Framework.</p>
<p>Design &amp; Construction Services delivers design and construction management services for campus projects while also ensuring appropriate standards are in place for the development of our facilities. This unit also provides services related to area master plans as well as preliminary studies required for capital projects.</p>
<p>Engineering Services delivers design and construction management services specific to utility and infrastructure projects and also advises Design &amp; Construction Services as well as Physical Plant Services regarding integration of utility and infrastructure networks into building projects and operations.</p>
<p>Physical Plant Services operates and maintains the physical campus whether it be utility system maintenance and repair, grounds management, custodial services, lockshop services, autoshop services, or planning and implementing important deferred maintenance and capital renewal projects approved by the campus. This Unit is first in line to take care of the campus day to day needs while ensuring the lights will still be on tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Construction Projects Business Office works with all units with PPDO to ensure business operations including the procurement and contracting process are in alignment with applicable legislation, UCOP and campus policies and protocols. The Office provides important support to campus project managers such as records management and also ensures budgets are accurately tracked.</p>
<p>Other changes forthcoming include a PPDO website, project process improvements, and updates to internal processes to streamline efficiencies toward best practices benchmarks.</p>

<h2>Themed Academic Working Groups</h2>
<p>I am delighted to announce that 28 groups have submitted Themed Academic Working Group reports. I am deeply impressed, though not surprised, by the exciting initiatives proposed. The collaborations are breathtaking in their ambition and interdisciplinary promise. They offer a window into the distinctive work for which our campus in known. It is my hope that members of the campus community will now take the opportunity to weigh in on the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ibIPFiIz5jEhSmRCYUs5azriL8T9S1WA">proposals</a>. Once the corresponding videos are recorded in the coming week, they also will be <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xa_XiNldOLWvFtoyzWV7RSw7FIKsx9Bj">available</a>. An online survey to collect campus feedback is available <a href="https://api.ucsc.edu/2018-academicgroups/login">here</a>. The survey closes at 11:59 p.m. May 3.</p>
<h2>Design Principles</h2>
<p>Over the Winter Quarter, we worked to craft design principles: clear, tightly defined guidelines that identify our institutional aspirations. The first draft of our principles emerged through a campuswide survey and many group conversations. They were refined by the Academic Advisory Committee, then workshopped by the Steering Committee, Academic Advisory Committee, Academic Senate Executive Committee, and an all-campus group of faculty, students, and staff. The principles that emerged from this elaborate process, which were forwarded to the chancellor and to me for final decisions, can be found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19uMNU2WhF_reFSc3_R8vxopl63e8udwM">Future State Design Brief</a>.</p>
<h2>Barriers to Research and Teaching</h2>
<p>In November, we began soliciting input on the internal barriers that campus community members feel stand in the way of our research and teaching. To date, we&#8217;ve solicited input from Senate committees, departments, a range of units, and from staff and student groups. We also have collected unsolicited comments from individual faculty, students, and staff. The feedback has resulted in a list of more than 400 items. A large number of these barriers were duplicative, related to narrowly focused department or divisional concerns, or touched upon issues well beyond the scope of academic planning. Multiple groups and individuals identified some 50 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huZ3yfjnA0lcQEHHx6j70NFIq3bfkGVUBIPsVsrJLG0/edit">barriers</a> that impede universitywide academic work.</p>
<p>Once the Academic Senate and SAP committees prioritize the list, I will direct a working group to study ways to reduce or eliminate the barriers identified as the highest priorities for attention.</p>
<h2>Student Engagement</h2>
<p>We have worked to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jwnSLA8pt8ODI-gZ5NaKkFCgxktz6TaYOJaMJtvsXw/edit?usp=sharing">engage students</a> in the process. To date, we have met with student leadership, held forums to answer questions, responded to many emailed inquiries, requested student participation in a SAP survey and workshop, and extended invitations to numerous student groups to answer questions and gather ideas about the SAP. At present, we are seeking additional meetings. If you have suggestions about how we can increase our student engagement efforts, we welcome your thoughts. Please email us at <a href="mailto:academicplan@ucsc.edu">academicplan@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<h2>Upcoming SAP forums</h2>
<p>We will hold additional SAP all-campus forums in late May to provide a progress report and to take questions. To help with our planning for the May 23 and 24 events, please <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/events.html">register</a> by noon Monday, May 21. Thank you.</p>

He starts Aug. 1.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Berger, who joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 2005, has been a driving force in our strategic academic planning initiative and has served as a leader in many capacities, including as acting vice provost for Academic Affairs in 2016&#8211;17, acting dean of the Arts Division from 2014&#8211;15, and associate dean of the Arts Division from 2012&#8211;14.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">His departure from UC Santa Cruz in June will align with the release of the first draft of the strategic academic plan, providing Vice Provost of Academic Affairs Herbert Lee with the opportunity to oversee its finalization and&#8212;in the 2018&#8211;19 academic year&#8211;its implementation.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0;">Additionally, Berger's leadership as co-chair of Beyond Compliance has led to several initiatives that will serve our campus for years to come. Academic Affairs will continue to play an instrumental role in engaging with faculty to reshape campus culture with the goal of creating an environment free from sexual violence and sexual harassment.</p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.4; margin: 18px 0 0;">Berger's thoughtful and collaborative approach to leadership will no doubt serve him well as he begins this next chapter in his career. I wish him the best.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f983c4898072701712b15d6ee07bcf3e"><name>lynda-rogers-departure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lynda M.

Rogers, dean of UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, has decided to retire, marking more than 12 years with UC Santa Cruz and 30 years of service in public education.<br/><br/>Lynda has been instrumental in the success and growth of UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, which is serving more students than ever. About 15,000 students annually enroll in extension courses to advance their professional skills, while 7 million K-12 students take standardized assessments designed and administered by Smarter Balanced. UC Scout, meanwhile, ensures every student in the state can take essential courses needed for college admissions by offering online college preparation and Advanced Placement courses.<br/><br/>Please join me in thanking Lynda for her academic and strategic leadership for this crucial area of our campus and system.<br/><br/>The campus will soon start a search for Lynda's successor.<br/><br/>In the meantime, it is a pleasure to announce that Therese Ammiro, assistant dean of UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, has agreed to serve as dean for extension on an interim basis. Pending approval from UC President Janet Napolitano, this appointment will begin July 1, 2018, and extend until we fill the position on a permanent basis.<br/><br/>Therese has been part of UCSC Silicon Valley Extension for 15 years, working in roles across the organization starting as an academic programs specialist and later advancing to a systems analyst and project manager.

Carroll, an award-winning scientist, writer, educator, and film producer, will give a free public lecture at UC Santa Cruz on Thursday, May 10, at 7 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.</p>
<p>An internationally recognized evolutionary biologist, Carroll is vice president for science education at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) and the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He is the author of several books, most recently <em>The Serengeti Rules: The Quest to Discover How Life Works and Why It Matters</em>. A film based on the book, also called <em>The Serengeti Rules</em>, premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival and will be screened at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz on Friday, May 11, at 7 p.m. Admission is free; <a href="https://connect.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=3014&amp;content_id=3049"><span>register online</span></a> to reserve seats.</p>
<p>Carroll&#8217;s talk on May 10, "Butterfly Spots and Rattlesnake Tales," is the 2018 Robert L. Sinsheimer Distinguished Lecture, sponsored by the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology. Carroll will address one of the central questions of evolution, the origin of novelty. His laboratory has been focused on the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of animal form and, more recently, on biochemical novelties such as the evolution of snake venom. While the general mechanisms involved are distinct, he says, a common lesson from these two pursuits has been to expect the unexpected in biology.</p>
<p>In <em>The Serengeti Rules</em>, Carroll told the stories of pioneering scientists who sought the answers to fundamental questions about how biological systems are regulated, from the human body to vast ecosystems like the Serengeti. The film version of <em>The Serengeti Rule</em>s, directed by Emmy and BAFTA award-winning filmmaker Nicolas Brown, focuses on a handful of young scientists who, beginning in the 1960s, ventured into wild areas from the tropics to the Arctic, driven by their curiosity about how nature works.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz ecologist James Estes, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, is among the scientists featured in the film. Ultimately, their investigations revealed a set of "rules" that govern all life on Earth. Now in the twilight of their eminent careers, these five unsung heroes of modern ecology share the stories of their adventures, reveal how their pioneering work flipped our view of nature on its head, and give us a chance to reimagine the world as it could and should be.</p>
<p>Carroll has served as executive producer or executive in charge of several feature documentary films or series including <em>The Farthest</em> (2017), <em>Amazon Adventure</em> (2017), <em>The Lucky Specials</em> (2017), <em>Spillover: Zika, Ebola &amp; Beyond</em> (2016), <em>Mass Extinction: Life at the Brink</em> (2014) and <em>Your Inner Fish</em> (2014), as well as approximately twenty short films.</p>
<p>In addition to <em>The Serengeti Rules</em>, Carroll's popular books include <em>Brave Genius: A Scientist, A Philosopher, and Their Daring Adventures from the French Resistance to the Nobel Prize;</em> <em>Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origins of Species</em>, which was a finalist for the 2009 National Book Award for non-fiction; and <em>Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo</em>. Carroll received Rockefeller University's Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing About Science in 2016.</p>
<p>For his educational contributions, Carroll has received the Stephen Jay Gould Prize for the advancement of the public understanding of evolution from the Society for the Study of Evolution, the Distinguished Service Award of the National Association of Biology Teachers, and the Viktor Hamburger Outstanding Educator Award from the Society for Developmental Biology.</p>
<p>In recognition of his scientific contributions, Carroll has received the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Sciences, been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>

<p>She is one of 84 artists from 18 states and six countries&#8212;out of a pool of 978 applicants&#8212;who have been awarded a 2018 fellowship from the <a href="http://www.macdowellcolony.org"><em><strong>MacDowell Colony</strong></em></a>, located in Peterborough, New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The incoming group of MacDowell Fellows also includes Pulitzer Prize-winning author Andrew Sean Greer, poet Monica Youn, composers Mark Dresser, Laura Schwendinger, and Kate Soper, and playwrights Brian Selznick and Rebecca Taichman.</p>
<p>A panel of distinguished professionals in each discipline selects MacDowell Fellows based solely on their talent, as evidenced by a work sample and project description. The highly competitive fellowships, each with an average value of $10,000, include the use of a private studio for a period of up to eight weeks, accommodations, and three meals a day.</p>
<p>Taylor said she plans to use the fellowship to work on her new feature documentary film in progress, currently titled <em>The Gut</em>.</p>
<p>The MacDowell Colony was founded in 1907 by composer Edward MacDowell and his wife, pianist Marian MacDowell, &#8220;to nurture the arts by offering creative individuals of the highest talent an inspiring environment in which to produce enduring works of the imagination.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Each year, MacDowell welcomes more than 300 architects, composers, filmmakers, interdisciplinary artists, theatre artists, visual artists, and writers from across the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>More than 14,500 residencies have been awarded since its inception, and past recipients have included&#160;Ayad Akhtar,&#160;James Baldwin,&#160;Ta-Nehisi Coates,&#160;Ellen Driscoll,&#160;Louise Erdrich,&#160;Osvaldo Golijov,&#160;Cathy Park Hong,&#160;Dee Rees,&#160;Colson Whitehead, and&#160;Julia Wolfe.</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author&#160;Michael Chabon&#160;is currently the chairman of MacDowell&#8217;s board of directors.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/taylor-pbs-race.html</url><title>Film professor contributes to new PBS documentary on race in America</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/carmel-festival-documentary.html</url><title>Carmel International Film Festival to screen film professor’s new documentary</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ff0c642d8072701712b15d6ef2fc5c0a"><name>studies-in-medicine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Innovative ‘Studies in Medicine’ course will be offered online to all UC students</title><summary>Developed by UC Santa Cruz biology professor Grant Hartzog and local physician Dr. Greg Gates, the popular course examines the field of medicine through a historical and philosophical lens.</summary><keywords>Grant Hartzog</keywords><start-date>1524751200000</start-date><display-name>Innovative ‘Studies in Medicine’ course will be offered online to all UC students</display-name><path>/2018/04/studies-in-medicine</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/studies-in-medicine</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1524697423882</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1524752670208</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Aylin Woodward</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/gates-hartzog-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/gates-hartzog-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gates-hartzog-410.jpg</name><display-name>gates-hartzog-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>92909</file-size><width>410</width><height>280</height></image><image-alt>Greg Gates &amp;

an interdisciplinary general inquiry course designed for both science majors and non-majors to dip their intellectual toes into the vast ocean of the modern healthcare marketplace.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a grant from UC's <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/innovative-learning-technology-initiative/">Innovative Learning Technology Initiative</a> (ILTI), Hartzog is working to take the popular course online and make it available to all UC students in spring 2019.</p>
<p>A professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, Hartzog said he strives to teach his students to be critical thinkers. &#8220;I want them to reflect, &#8216;How, as a non-expert, do I critically evaluate what I&#8217;m told about healthcare? How do I assess whether the information that is being advertised to me is reliable?&#8217;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hartzog worked with Gates, a retired emergency room physician, to design the "Studies in Medicine" course. The two co-teach each session of the class, with Gates sharing an insider&#8217;s perspective on how physicians gather information and solve problems and what patients can reasonably expect to get from the world of Western medicine. According to Hartzog, Gates wants to create a more educated populace and help students discern the difference between real medicine and quackery.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s more, we want to teach these students about how they can, as patients, help their healthcare providers do a better job,&#8221; Hartzog said.</p>
<p>Along the way, Gates and Hartzog lead students through discussions about the history of medicine&#8212;both Western and other traditions like Chinese and Indian medicine&#8212;and the development of modern medical technology. Students delve into the emotional and psychological issues that cloud medical treatments, the role of placebos, and ethical considerations in a multicultural healthcare workplace. In their quest to evaluate the evolution of modern medicine, they read everything from Siddhartha Mukherjee&#8217;s Pulitzer-Prize-winning <em>The Emperor of all Maladies</em> to Thucydides&#8217;s account of the Peloponnesian Wars.</p>

<p>Soon, students at other UC campuses will be able to join in Gates and Hartzog&#8217;s cerebral smorgasbord. The ILTI grant provides funding to shoot videos and develop a fully online version of the course. &#8220;We&#8217;ve committed to teaching the course fully online five times in next five years,&#8221; Hartzog said.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first UC Santa Cruz course to be offered system-wide. Others include online calculus courses, a water policy course, and "Geology of the National Parks."</p>
<p>&#8220;The final frontier is taking this class online,&#8221; Hartzog said. &#8220;This was always Gates&#8217;s original vision for the course&#8212;for it to become something of value for people across the state, not just in Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hartzog said he knows the coming year will be filled with challenges as he and Gates work to adapt the course and its curriculum for a life online. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to manage that transition from having a live audience to having a remote one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How do we keep them engaged and provide a vital learning experience for them? It&#8217;s something that keeps me up at night right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hartzog and Gates are teaching the course this quarter in the new Active Learning Classroom in the Science &amp; Engineering Library. With 96 students enrolled, it is the biggest class yet. The course draws students from nearly every academic discipline&#8212;not only pre-med majors, but also students from the arts, social sciences, and the humanities. Hartzog thinks this diversity adds to the depth and breadth of class discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students are exposed to a wider range of opinions, viewpoints, and experiences than when they are in courses required for their majors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been teaching for 20 years, and this is one of the most rewarding and most popular courses I have taught.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://giving.ucsc.edu/donor-profiles/helping-students-spot-medical-pseudoscience/</url><title>Helping students spot medical pseudoscience</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/07/online-courses.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz develops innovative online courses available to all UC students</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="03a2c1488072701712b15d6e98c4902c"><name>prescribed-burn</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Prescribed burns through April, early May</title><summary>Cal Fire has advised that prescribed pile burns will continue on Saturday and through the next two weeks in the areas of Wilder State Park and north campus. </summary><start-date>1524207600000</start-date><display-name>Prescribed burn</display-name><path>/2018/04/prescribed-burn</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/prescribed-burn</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1524774386989</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1524774386989</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Cal Fire has advised that prescribed pile burns will continue on Saturday and through the next two weeks in the areas of Wilder State Park and north campus. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/04/images/pile-burns.pdf">View a map</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Crews will be at Marshall Field in Upper Campus on Wednesday, May 2.</p>
<p>Pile burns are controlled and condensed, and typically produce less smoke than do surface burns. However, persons susceptible to smoke or visiting these areas should be advised of air quality concerns.</p>
<p>What to do: If you are affected by air quality issues, stay indoors or leave the immediate area. Close windows until the burn has concluded.</p>
<p>BE SAFE: When there is a fire warning, be alert to as to what is going on around you. If you see fire, call 911 from a safe location.</p>
<p>REDUCE EXPOSURE: If the air is considered unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous, limit your outdoor activities and stay inside with the window and doors closed, or if possible, leave the area. Drink plenty of fluids to keep your airway moist and easier to clear. If you are feeling unhealthy due to poor air quality see your medical provider. You can check the air quality <a href="https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;cityid=548">online</a>.</p>
<p>RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: NIOSH-approved N95 filtering respirators can be helpful in filtering poor-quality air. N95s can be purchased online or at local hardware stories. A medical provider may also be a source.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of this distressing situation, distinguished scientist and former congressman Rush Holt urged scientists to &#8220;stop complaining about public misunderstandings and decrying public attitudes toward science&#8221; and do something about it during a rousing speech at UC Santa Cruz last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holt was on hand to deliver this year&#8217;s Osterbrock Distinguished Leadership Lecture, sponsored by the </span><a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/academics/Osterbrock/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osterbrock Leadership Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides thoughtful and informed leadership training for UC Santa Cruz graduate students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holt addressed a rapt audience of 115 people, which was like a &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; listing of distinguished science professors at UC Santa Cruz. No less than Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics and a recipient of the National Medal of Science, introduced him to the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rush Holt is better qualified than almost anyone to talk about the role of the Ph.D. scientist in shaping science policy,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holt urged scientists to empower and not talk down to the public, while encouraging non-scientists to value hard evidence rather than empty rhetoric. During his remarks, he spoke with urgency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The disregard for evidence right now is really great,&#8221; Holt said. &#8220;Peddling falsehood is a boom industry. We can&#8217;t count on experts to be present at every opportunity to eradicate falsehoods, not when they are being replicated by hundreds of thousands, by millions, on social media.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holt, a teacher, scientist, administrator, and policymaker, asked scientists to reconsider their approach to getting the word out about their research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The most important challenge is how to build a broad and deep understanding of how science works, convincing readers, and the public, that the most important benefit of science to society is science itself,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holt is in a strong position to address such pressing issues. As CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), he leads the world's largest multidisciplinary scientific and engineering membership organization. Prior to joining AAAS in 2015, Holt served as the U.S. Representative for New Jersey's 12th Congressional District, directed the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, and taught physics at Swarthmore College. He holds M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from New York University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how can scientists foster such strong evidence-based values? Before providing a potential answer, Holt provided a list of &#8220;don&#8217;ts&#8221; for scientists. For example, he urged scientists to &#8220;resist the temptation to hand down findings of science with an authoritative arrogance.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that mere &#8220;clarity and simplicity&#8221; for their own sake is &#8220;not a very good way to build rapport with an audience.&#8221; It would be far more effective if scientists found ways to encourage audiences to &#8220;think like scientists,&#8221; Holt said. &#8220;Every talk, every communication, should tell the story of evidence, and build a respect, even a reverence for evidence.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the process, he said, scientists need to work harder to fight the notion that science is something esoteric and inaccessible, locked in a secret vault that is accessible only to trained scientists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People need to feel that they can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">use </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">science,&#8217;&#8217; Holt said. Science literacy, he said, is not about equipping people to understand the jargon and nomenclature of scientific inquiry &#8220;but rather to equip them to deal with evidence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If evidence itself becomes the primary talking point, this shift in focus could change the public discourse around science, while diminishing the hostility that scientists face, Holt said. At the same time, this emphasis on evidence could change public scientific discussions and lead to the reframing of crucial questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instead of asking you, &#8216;Do you believe in climate change?,&#8217; which of course is the wrong question&#8212;it is not a matter of belief&#8212;your friend would ask, &#8216;What is the evidence?&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holt, in closing, explained the reasoning behind his scientific outreach advice. He said that America is a place where too many people will let preexisting beliefs and political affiliations determine their positions on scientific issues, and where &#8220;ideology and evidence are frequently taken to be interchangeable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time has come to get out an important message: &#8220;Science does work, even if it is sometimes slow and sometimes requires course-correction,&#8221; Holt said. &#8220;In fact, it works remarkably well. It is the greatest invention of the last half millennium.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0813dcc88072701712b15d6e0eed14f7"><name>thwaites-glacier</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz glaciologist leads project to study Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier</title><summary>Earth sciences professor Slawek Tulaczyk will lead one of eight projects in a joint U.S.-U.K. research program to understand how quickly the massive Antarctic glacier could collapse.</summary><keywords>Slawek Tulaczyk, West Antarctic ice sheet, Thwaites Glacier</keywords><start-date>1525096800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz glaciologist leads project to study Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier</display-name><path>/2018/04/thwaites-glacier</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/thwaites-glacier</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1524848908380</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1525098792920</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/thwaites-edge-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/thwaites-edge-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>thwaites-edge-410.jpg</name><display-name>thwaites-edge-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>74239</file-size><width>410</width><height>568</height></image><image-alt>Thwaites Glacier</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/thwaites-edge-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/thwaites-edge-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>thwaites-edge-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>thwaites-edge-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>12118</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Thwaites Glacier</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The rate of ice loss from the massive Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica has doubled since the 1990s.

Draining an area roughly the size of Britain or Florida, Thwaites Glacier already accounts for around 4 percent of global sea-level rise, and satellite measurements show that its rate of ice loss has doubled since the 1990s.</p>
<p>Yet this glacier is remote even by Antarctic standards and remains poorly understood. To unravel its mysteries, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) are launching the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), a $25 million initiative supporting the efforts of about 100 scientists working on eight different research projects to help predict the future evolution of Thwaites Glacier and assess the sensitivity of the Antarctic ice sheet to changes in climate.</p>
<p>Slawek Tulaczyk, professor of Earth sciences at UC Santa Cruz, will serve as the U.S. leader of the Thwaites Interdisciplinary Margin Evolution (TIME) project, involving 11 U.S. and U.K. scientists. The researchers will use precision GPS, seismic, and radar instrumentation to collect new data on the current behavior and future evolution of the side margins of Thwaites Glacier. These new data will help improve computer models used to predict the future contribution of the West Antarctic ice sheet to global sea level changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Side margins of large glaciers like Thwaites control how rapidly ice flows from the Antarctic ice sheet into the ocean,&#8221; Tulaczyk explained. &#8220;This international research effort will enable us to collect new data that will result in more reliable predictions of future sea level changes. I feel very privileged to have this opportunity to address an important scientific problem while working with an excellent group of highly skilled scientists in one of the most remote locations on Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tulaczyk has been studying the West Antarctic ice sheet for nearly two decades, most recently as co-leader of a major NSF-funded project to drill beneath the ice sheet and examine subglacial environments (the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/wissard-update.html"><span>WISSARD project</span></a>).</p>
<p>The TIME project has received $3.4 million in funding, including $2.4 million from NSF for the U.S. investigators and $1 million from NERC for the U.K. investigators. The U.K. co-leader of the project is Poul Christoffersen of the University of Cambridge, who will focus on ice-penetrating radar data collection with Dustin Schroder of Stanford University. Seismic investigations will involve Adam Booth at University of Leeds, U.K.; Galen Kaip, Marianne Karplus, and Steven Harder at University of Texas, El Paso; and Norimitsu Nakata and Jacob Walter at University of Oklahoma. The development of improved computer models will be executed by Marion Bougamont at University of Cambridge and Jenny Suckale at Stanford University.</p>
<p>In addition to funding for the research teams, the logistics of mounting a scientific campaign in one of the most remote places in Antarctica could cost as much again in logistical support. The nearest permanently occupied research station to the Thwaites Glacier is more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away, so getting the scientists to where they need to be will take a major joint effort from both nations. While researchers on the ice will rely on aircraft support from U.K. and U.S. research stations, oceanographers and geophysicists will approach the glacier from the sea in U.K. and U.S. research icebreakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;For more than a decade, satellites have identified this area as a region of massive ice loss and rapid change. But there are still many aspects of the ice and ocean that cannot be determined from space,&#8221; said Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the lead U.S. scientific coordinator of ITGC. &#8220;We need to go there, with a robust scientific plan of activity, and learn more about how this area is changing in detail, so we can reduce the uncertainty of what might happen in the future.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Abigail Usita (College Nine &#8217;18, human biology), learning the traditional Pilipino stick-dance called Tinikling wasn&#8217;t just about having fun. It was about a cultural journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created during Spanish colonial times in the Philippines, the dance involves two people clapping together a pair of bamboo poles while a dancer leaps and moves around them. The steps are meant to represent the deft movements of the tikling bird as it jumps over branches, runs through the grass, and evades capture in farmers&#8217; bamboo traps, but it also suggests the strength and resilience of the Pilipino people who have rebelled under both conquerors and dictators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had a traditional family,&#8221; says Usita, who is a member of the UC Santa Cruz Pagkakaisa Dance Troupe, which regularly performs the Tinikling dance. &#8220;I was proud of my culture, but I didn&#8217;t appreciate it until I came here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday and Saturday, April 27&#8211;28, the dance group will be on the bill as part of the Pilipino Cultural Celebration, which will be at 7:30 p.m. on the campus Mainstage Theater and will also include music, theater, and poetry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are about 30 members on the squad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pagkakaisa Dance Troupe has been around campus for three decades or so and has a long list of alumni, according to Brandon Edwin De Guzman (Crown &#8217;18, human biology), who is one of the group&#8217;s coordinators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For him and others, the dance group is not only a way to de-stress from the rigors of college but is also a way to form community and build stronger ties to their heritage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The troupe &#8220;filled I void I didn&#8217;t understand until college,&#8221; says De Guzman while sitting in the Stevenson Events Center and waiting to rehearse for the upcoming Pilipino Cultural Celebration. &#8220;I grew up in a town where our community wasn&#8217;t that big, so I didn&#8217;t have that cultural interaction with my Pilipino background except with my family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really wanted to find my Pilipino roots and just know more about my culture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What draws people to this (the dance troupe) is that a lot of people of color are becoming more comfortable with displaying their culture,&#8221; says Kevin Chung (College Nine &#8217;18, intensive psychology) and another coordinator for the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is Korean-American but found a place in the group, which is under the umbrella of Bayanihan, previously known as the Filipino Student Association. Here, he says, he learned not only to appreciate culture but also to teach others about his heritage as a Korean as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me it is about being a strong ally and appreciating the parallels and differences of culture, and learning to appreciate my own Korean heritage through this process that keeps me dedicated to this space,&#8221; Chung says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sentiment, the need to find community on a large campus, is a big draw for its members. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I met a great community,&#8221; Usita says. &#8220;I had a little family within the space.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the Stevenson Events Center is filled with about 100 students eating take-out, laughing, and working at their computers as their friends rehearse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maelia Uy-Gomez (Rachel Carson &#8217;18, bioelectronics engineering and bioinformatics), whose roots are both in Mexico and the Philippines, says she learned a lot about her Mexican culture in school but not much about the Pilipino side of her family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to appreciate and embrace my heritage and learn things you were never taught in school,&#8221; says Uy-Gomez, who is another coordinator for the dance troupe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her, dance is a physical connection to a rich heritage and history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got a newfound appreciation of where I came from.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/splinters-in-ankles.html</url><title>Dance professor fights cultural amnesia with ‘Splinters in Our Ankles'</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1771b93c8072701712b15d6e0bcb567b"><name>staff-engagement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Enhancing staff engagement</title><summary>Ensuring we can enhance our employee engagement is a priority for the campus leadership team.</summary><start-date>1524812400000</start-date><display-name>Enhancing staff engagement</display-name><path>/2018/04/staff-engagement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/staff-engagement</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1525106717964</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1525106717964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Staff members play a central role in the mission of UC Santa Cruz, and it is vital that they feel valued and engaged. This is important for staff retention, as well as for the success of our campus and the fundamental health of our community. It was, in fact, the importance of staff that inspired the reinstitution of the Campus Welfare Committee (CWC) last year and the charge that instructed this group to focus on ways to improve staff engagement.</p>
<h2>The work of the CWC</h2>
<p>CWC began by looking at the research on employee engagement to better understand what impacts it. The committee also reviewed the results of the last three UC employee engagement surveys. Compared to other campuses in the system, UC Santa Cruz has performed at or near the bottom on the level of engagement.</p>
<p>Four areas where UC Santa Cruz had statistically significant lower levels of performance were in the areas of engagement, career development, organizational change, and image/brand. In addition to reviewing the engagement survey findings, the committee invited <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/human-resources/coro/2017_forms/2016-CORO-Projects-Northern-California-Final-Report.pdf">members from the 2016&#8211;17 CORO cohort</a>, which is a UC-wide leadership development program, to present the findings of their year-long study on diversity and inclusion across employees at UC. The committee felt the CORO findings would help provide additional context on the engagement of employees.</p>
<p>From this work, the CWC identified six categories to frame their exploration on engagement and the development of recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>community building</li>
<li>communication</li>
<li>workload</li>
<li>professional advancement</li>
<li>change management</li>
<li>training and mentorship</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to generate feedback to form recommendations in each of the six categories, the CWC conducted focus groups and sent out a campus survey. The CWC also sought feedback on activities already underway across the campus in the six categories.</p>
<p>As a result of this work the CWC identified a set of recommendations in the six categories of engagement. These recommendations consist of a mix of current best practices, enhanced communication about existing programs, and potential new initiatives and programs.</p>
<h2>Ways to learn more and provide feedback</h2>
<p>In order to share the recommendations, discuss actions underway and get feedback on the priorities for investment, we are hosting three staff listening sessions. They will take place at:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 a.m., May 4 in the Auditorium at the UC Santa Cruz Scotts Valley Center.</li>
<li>2 p.m., June 6 at the Stevenson Event Center at the UC Santa Cruz main campus.</li>
<li>3 p.m on June 26 in Room 2110 at the Silicon Valley Center.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each session will last one hour and is open to all staff. Members of the CWC and Staff Human Resources will be on hand to help facilitate the discussion and feedback.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Through 2018, the committee will continue its work into the next phase of activity, consisting of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monitoring implementation of actions already underway,</li>
<li>Engaging with the campus community as to other recommendations that would require new programs, initiatives, or resources, and</li>
<li>Overseeing a task force charged with focusing on the development of a compensation philosophy. The lack of a locally articulated compensation philosophy can lead to confusion and negatively impact employee engagement and satisfaction. This task force will work to develop a campus compensation philosophy. During our listening sessions, we will review the charge of the compensation philosophy task force.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensuring we can enhance our employee engagement is a priority for the campus leadership team. Our employees and their contributions are valuable to our community. We hope that staff will join us for our listening sessions to discuss this very important aspect of our campus community.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They cooled down with frozen chocolate-covered bananas after stomping their way through the Campus 5K Fun Run. They posed for pictures with Sammy the Slug, flagged down free &#8220;Slug taxis&#8217;&#8217; driven by campus staff members, and took to the airwaves at KZSC FM, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s homegrown radio station, now celebrating 50 years of music and inspiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, returning alumni were never at a loss for things to do, people to meet, beer glasses to drain, and topics to explore. But these prodigal Banana Slugs also had time to look back and reflect on how their time at UC Santa Cruz molded their philosophies and career outlooks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was certainly true for Jeremy Mifsud (Cowell &#8217;14, philosophy), a substitute teacher who plans to go to San Francisco State University for his teaching credential. Mifsud has his sights on a career as a history teacher&#8212;and UC Santa Cruz helped him on his way by awakening his social consciousness while honing his critical thinking skills. &#8220;This place shaped me immensely&#8221; he said, while taking a break from Alumni Weekend festivities in Quarry Plaza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz felt like welcome break from San Mateo County when he first set foot here. &#8220;Not to say my hometown is horrible, but no one smiles,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what a tight-knit community was until I got here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JoanMay Cordova (Cowell, &#8217;77, community studies) felt like she was among family while attending Alumni Weekend with close pal Evelyn Casuga (Merrill &#8217;76, community studies/psychology.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the two of them met for the first time as undergraduates, they were among a tiny contingent of Filipino-American students on campus. Both hail from small, Central Valley farming communities, and their connection was immediate: &#8220;It felt like we were twin sisters with different mothers!&#8221; Cordova said.&#160; <br/></span></p>
<p><strong>Raise the roof. Bring down the house </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">B</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eloved feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker held court on Saturday at the recently reopened campus landmark, the UC Santa Cruz Quarry Amphitheater. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A steady and reliable force on campus for four decades, Aptheker gave a powerful speech about the ethical role of public universities. </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Given the state of &#8216;no ethics&#8217; percolating through the current administration in Washington, it is very hard to know quite where to begin today,&#8221; Aptheker said during the Faculty Keynote/Baskin Ethics Lecture. &#8220;The ethical collapse in Washington pervades the country.&#8221; </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She argued that this collapse is tethered to misogyny, racism, and assaults on women&#8217;s reproductive health, along with a spirit of anti-intellectualism. She also decried the &#8220;grossly underfunded&#8221; state of California&#8217;s K-12 educational system and diminished public funds for higher education, which paved the way for nominal college fees giving way to tuition costs that create new barriers to young scholars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Aptheker&#8217;s speech was far from gloomy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t give up. Don&#8217;t be despaired. Oh, no, no, no, we don&#8217;t despair, we just get ourselves up and go forward.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker, the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies, l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aid out this path forward for the audience, and got a standing ovation for her efforts. She urged strong public resistance to ensure that the university is a &#8220;sanctuary for human rights, Dreamers, scientific research, and academic freedom.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she also urged academics to step up their game and broaden their outreach. &#160;In her on-stage dialogue with campus provost and executive vice chancellor Marlene Tromp, Aptheker said that today&#8217;s academics, faced with a climate of rampant anti-intellectualism, must make sure their work is accessible and beneficial to the public, and that their writings and research have an audience that goes far beyond other academics.</span></p>
<p><strong>Arts, crafts, and the return of DJ Oy Dog </strong></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All over campus, so much was going on that it was easy to get double-booked. Everywhere you looked, something big was happening. Alumni toured biomedical science labs, browsed through the farm, and succumbed to the power of Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller&#8217;s astounding sound installation, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest (for a thousand years&#8230;)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KZSC FM called alumni deejays back to the station to celebrate its 50th. One of those returning broadcasters was Dylan Music&#8212;yes, that is his real name&#8212;who made a name for himself on campus with his radio show Muzikal Jewz, a smorgasbord of rarities, comic masterpieces, and Jewish-themed novelty songs. In those days, his on-the-air nickname was DJ Oy Dog.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Music (Kresge &#8217;08, literature), now a morning host at KAZU FM, the Monterey Bay NPR affiliate, rhapsodized about the creative breakthroughs he had at KZSC. &#8220;They let you have free rein,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do you want to do to fill radio air space? There were unlimited possibilities.&#8221; </span><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While on the air, Music hoped for &#8220;50 more years of the log cabin in the woods,&#8221; referring to KZSC&#8217;s rustic digs at Merrill College. Then he spun a toe-tapping little ditty called &#8220;It&#8217;s a Scream When Levine Does the Rhumba,&#8221; a vintage tune sung by Ruth Wallis. </span></p>
<p><strong>Getting serious</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the glories of Alumni Weekend is the variety. Just by walking a few feet, you could go from silly to serious, from goofy to revelatory, simply by switching up the venue. Within short walking distance of KZSC, professor Mark Fathi Massoud drew a capacity crowd to the annual</span><a href="http://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/sessions/noel-q-king-memorial-lecture/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Noel Q. King Memorial Lecture in History and Comparative Religion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where he explored intricacies of shari&#8217;a. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massoud, associate professor of politics and legal studies at UC Santa Cruz, said shari&#8217;a, &#160;which encompasses ethical formation, faith traditions, and living practices that invite interpretation, learning, and education, is &#8220;much more malleable&#8217;&#8217; than many people realize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we see it merely as the divine revelation of God interpreted by jurists, judges, and people every day,&#8221; we miss the way that Muslims across the world &#8220;make and remake and embrace&#8221; shari&#8217;a, using it as a tool to make ethical decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, he talked about interviewing a devout Muslim woman, living in conservative Orange County, who decided in 2008 to vote against Proposition 8, a California ballot initiative whose supporters wished to roll back same-sex marriage. The measure was effectively overturned by the Supreme Court five years later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She read the Koran, she went on YouTube to hear religious leaders speak, and she spoke to an imam,&#8221; Massoud noted. &#8220;She decided that to be shari&#8217;a compliant, her duty was not to take a legal right from people who already had it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same venue, a Merrill College Alumni Panel regarding free speech and academic freedom&#8212;part of Merrill&#8217;s 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary celebration&#8212;included a passionate exploration of a pressing question: What would they do if a highly controversial and inflammatory far-right speaker, with a history of homophobic, anti-Semitic, and racist statements, was invited to speak on campus? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a presentation entitled &#8220;Five Decades of Free Speech and Political Action at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; the panelists said that such people should be allowed to speak, regardless of their odious views, to preserve freedom of speech on campus, insisting that these events, painful as they may be, can still be an opportunity for dialogue and transformation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m concerned about the suppression of free speech,&#8221; even in cases where a speaker is bringing forth loathsome and hateful points of view, said Mark Stephens, (Merill, &#8216;83, community studies and sociology) who is an author and yoga teacher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But panelists also insisted that hate speech be challenged in nonviolent ways. &#160;History has shown that unchecked and unchallenged hateful and divisive speechmaking can lead to violence and even genocide, said Adam Butler (Merill, &#8216;09, American studies) who works for Lezyne USA Inc., a San Luis Obispo-based company that creates high-tech bike accessories.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sometimes the absolute acceptance of free speech can lead to danger and violence,&#8221; Butler said. &#160;&#8220;Things can go wrong very quickly if there aren&#8217;t some kinds of checks and balances.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he also has concern that mere &#8220;shock purveyors,&#8221; passing themselves as political commentators, are showing up at communities expressly to cause trouble. </span></p>
<strong>Getting down </strong><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such hot topics on their minds, alumni needed a chance to mellow out before leaving campus. That&#8217;s why hundreds of them flocked to the aptly named &#8220;Wind Down: Alumni Beer and Wine Reception&#8221; at the Quarry Amphitheater, where jazzy music, good conversation, mini-hot dogs, assorted cheeses, and delicious beverages awaited them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs sipped local offerings from homegrown breweries New Bohemian and Uncommon, tried wines from alumni vintners, and looked forward to the next reunion. In the waning light, Sammy Slug joined the crowd in doing &#8220;the wave.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The festivities ended with a wish from Marlene Tromp, who toasted the gathering before a striking backdrop of rocky outcroppings, majestic trees, and open sky: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here&#8217;s to 50 more magical years,&#8221; she said, invoking the crowd to raise their glasses. &#8220;Salud!&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1ba4fda88072701712b15d6efe90c14f"><name>summer-session</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Enrollment opens for Summer Session</title><summary>Open enrollment is underway for UC Santa Cruz Summer Session, which offers a wide range of classes and online courses across multiple departments.</summary><start-date>1525071600000</start-date><display-name>Summer session</display-name><path>/2018/04/summer-session</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/04/summer-session</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1525177186659</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1525191457889</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/summer-session-lab-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/summer-session-lab-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>summer-session-lab-500px.jpg</name><display-name>summer-session-lab-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>219200</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Students in a lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/04/images/summer-session-thumb-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/04/images/summer-session-thumb-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>summer-session-thumb-80px.jpg</name><display-name>summer-session-thumb-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>17516</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Student in a lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Open enrollment is underway for UC Santa Cruz Summer Session, which offers a wide range of classes and online courses across multiple departments.</p>
<p>Summer is the perfect time for smaller class sizes and a peaceful atmosphere. There are more than 300 courses including STEM essentials, life in the sea, survey of rap and hip hop music, and anything UC Santa Cruz students need to graduate. There are also 34 online classes offered so students can take summer anywhere.</p>
<p>Extended again this year, UC Santa Cruz staff and faculty get half-off tuition to encourage professional and personal development. Students and staff can enroll up until the first day of classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Summer is a unique time when classes are open to everyone,&#8221; said Monica Parikh, director of Summer Session. &#8220;Staff, community members, high school students eager to start their college education, and students from other universities can take advantage of this fabulous campus.&#8221; With multiple sessions, summer allows ample time to study with top-notch faculty, while still having time to work and have fun.</p>
