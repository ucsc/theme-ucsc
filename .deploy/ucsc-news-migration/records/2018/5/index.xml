discovery grant funds quest by UCSC chemistry professor Ted Holman to bring a new drug treatment for stroke to clinical trials</article-subhead><article-text><p>Most strokes occur when a blood vessel carrying oxygen to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. A drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can dissolve the clot and restore blood flow, but only a small percentage of stroke patients get this treatment due to the risks associated with it. Stroke is currently the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s clearly a big need for a novel stroke drug,&#8221; said Theodore Holman, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Holman has been collaborating with Klaus van Leyen at Massachusetts General Hospital to develop a new type of drug that can protect brain cells from the damaging effects of a stroke. When a stroke interrupts the flow of blood in the brain, the affected area of the brain is deprived of oxygen and brain cells begin to die. Abilities such as movement or speech that were controlled by the damaged parts of the brain are then impaired, sometimes permanently.</p>
<p>But if blood flow and its associated oxygen are restored fast enough, the patient enters a &#8220;grey zone&#8221; where doctors could potentially rescue the brain tissue, Holman said. That grey zone is where his team&#8217;s new drug, called ML351, comes in.</p>
<p>ML351 works to inhibit an enzyme known as 12/15-lipoxygenase, which is produced in large amounts when brain tissue is under oxidative stress. Lipoxygenase, which Holman has been studying since 1993, is a major contributor to irreversible cell death during strokes. By inhibiting the enzyme&#8217;s activity in the aftermath of a stroke, the new drug treatment could protect brain cells and reduce the amount of damage in the brain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can induce strokes in mice, and if we give them our drug, we can reduce the damaged area by 40 percent,&#8221; Holman said. &#8220;Even lowering damage by 20 percent can have clinically significant outcomes&#8212;like restoration of the patient&#8217;s verbal skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holman said he envisions the new drug being used in combination with tPA or possibly on its own. The problem with tPA is that it has to be given promptly, but it can seriously harm patients with strokes caused by a ruptured artery (hemorrhagic stroke) rather than a blood clot (ischemic stroke). And if given too late, it can even cause bleeding in brain tissue already damaged by an ischemic stroke. Therefore, the decision to administer tPA or not must often be made before doctors can perform the tests needed to differentiate an ischemic stroke from a hemorrhagic stroke.</p>
<p>It is this dilemma that has limited the use of tPA to fewer than 10 percent of stroke patients. Holman said the new drug might give doctors more time to conduct tests and make an informed decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hope is that it will replace tPA,&#8221; he said. &#8220;TPA may be needed eventually to remove the clot, but our hope is that the new drug will become a stand-alone therapy that can be given immediately to both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>ML351 is currently the lead compound, but the researchers are still working to optimize its pharmacological properties. Getting a drug from this experimental phase to clinical trials involving human subjects is very costly, and van Leyen and Holman have had a hard time getting pharmaceutical companies interested in ML351.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think the drug companies would be falling all over themselves to tap into that market, but they aren&#8217;t because getting a drug candidate through clinical trials is too expensive,&#8221; Holman said. &#8220;Klaus and I talked to three different companies, and they won&#8217;t touch it with a ten-foot pole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has stepped in, awarding the duo $1.5 million in direct funding, with another $8.5 million in support funds, to bring their lipoxygenase inhibitor drug to Phase I clinical trials in the next five years.</p>
<p>According to Holman, the NIH usually doesn&#8217;t get involved in clinical discovery, but the agency developed a funding stream called the <a href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/bpdrugs/index.htm"><span>Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network</span></a> to support discovery and development efforts for neurotherapeutic drugs that pharmaceutical companies often hesitate to invest in. Since the network&#8217;s inception in 2011, it has funded 23 projects&#8212;about three per year.</p>
<p>Holman called this grant the &#8220;golden ticket&#8221; that will enable him and van Leyen to take their drug from the lab bench to clinical trials and, eventually, to the marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate the NIH is rolling the dice on this,&#8221; Holman said. &#8220;Now the pressure&#8217;s on&#8212;we have to solve the stroke dilemma.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1c1787a68072701712b15d6e1ecfc0ff"><name>strike-advisory</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scheduled labor strike for week of May 7</title><summary>The University of California has been informed that there will be a AFSCME service worker labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers beginning at 4 a.m. on May 7  and ending at 4 a.m. May 10.</summary><start-date>1525158000000</start-date><display-name>Strike advisory</display-name><path>/2018/05/strike-advisory</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/strike-advisory</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1525184693114</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1525190631921</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University of California has been informed that there will be a AFSCME service worker labor strike on all of its campuses and medical centers beginning at 4 a.m. on May 7 and ending at 4 a.m. on May 10.</p>
<p>UC and AFSCME 3299 have been unable to reach agreement on a new service worker agreement, and the union has called for a systemwide strike. The university acknowledges AFSCME&#8217;s right to engage in protected, concerted activity. However, we expect that participants in a strike will remain respectful of the rights and needs of the broader campus community and that any strike-related activities on our campus will unfold in a safe and positive manner.</p>
<p>At this time, we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus.</p>
<p>Given that the strike falls in the midst of spring quarter, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faculty should communicate via email with students to discuss contingency plans, should access to campus be limited.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Staff members should check in with supervisors and managers ahead of this day to discuss their schedules and work locations.</span> And it is imperative that students, staff, and faculty monitor developments throughout the strike day. As a manager, supervisor, or employee, if you have questions about the strike or the impact of the strike on your working environment or your employees, please contact your Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst.</p>
<p>Toward that end, we will be activating a number of communication channels that will enable members of the campus community to stay informed about any operational impacts caused by strike activities.</p>
<p>Before coming to campus on Monday, May 7, please visit <a href="https://ucsc.edu/advisory">ucsc.edu/advisory</a>, where the Public Affairs Office will post information and updates. The campus's communication hotline (459-INFO) will be activated early in the morning on May 7 and KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) will broadcast news and information on an as-needed basis. We will also share information via <a href="https://twitter.com/ucsc">UCSC's Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you haven't done so already, please make sure your contact information is current in <a href="#">CruzAlert</a>, the campus's phone-based emergency notification system.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your cooperation and patience.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community </audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1cbe974c8072701712b15d6e923e8c33"><name>medina-strauss</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Undergraduate Eric Medina wins $15,000 Strauss Scholarship to reinvigorate Oakes Garden</title><summary>Eric Medina, a fourth year at UC Santa Cruz double majoring in ecology and evolutionary biology and Latin American and Latino studies, has received a $15,000 public service scholarship to reinvigorate the garden at Oakes College.&#13;

<p>The Donald A. Strauss Public Service Scholarship Foundation presents scholarships to up to 15 California college students annually to support projects they will carry out during their junior or senior year.</p>
<p>Medina, who grew up in Mendocino, says food and sustainable gardening are empowering. "Since high school, food has always been incredibly important to me," he said. "It was a major step in my life when I decided that I deserved food that made me feel good and capable."</p>
<p>Reinvigorating the Oakes Garden will increase student access to healthy foods, which is linked to other aspects of wellbeing, he said. "How can one advocate for issues like gender equality or racial justice if they aren&#8217;t having their fundamental needs met?," asked Medina, who was a core member of the Kresge Garden Cooperative and now works for Food What?!, a youth empowerment and food justice program based on the UCSC Farm.&#160;</p>
<p>Medina and other members of the garden want the renewed Oakes Garden to be a place where students can learn about sustainable gardening practices and be a hub for dialogue and action on issues related to food security for students on campus. Medina sees the garden as a space that will build community and empower students from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Donald A. Strauss Public Service Scholarship Foundation was established in 1997 as a memorial to the late Don Strauss of Newport Beach, who demonstrated a strong, life-long commitment to public service and education. Since its inception, the foundation has awarded more than 280 scholarships.</p>

<p>I write to inform you of expected impacts affecting Physical Planning, Development &amp; Operation&#8217;s (PPDO) ability to provide a normal level of service to the campus during the expected union labor strike, announced to start at 4 a.m. May 7 and end at 4 a.m. May 10.</p>
<p>Should entry to the campus be closed down or severely hindered, our ability to provide normal Custodial, Grounds, Building, Utility, and Fleet Services will be greatly reduced. As a result, PPDO will provide services based on a triaged emergency response approach focused on life safety, public health, and business continuity. Normal, routine, or non-emergency work requests and projects will be of a lower priority until staffing levels are re-established in a manner supporting normal operations.</p>
<p>Based on current plans, the following services levels will be provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custodial Services: Sanitation efforts and stocking supplies for restrooms, showers, and other critical areas as well as removal of trash from buildings.</li>
<li>Grounds Services: Refuse removal from exterior locations, management of downed trees/limbs and similar issues.</li>
<li>Building and Utility Services: Emergency calls such as plumbing leaks, sewer backups, fume hood alarms, power outages and structural issues.</li>
<li>Fleet Services: Emergency vehicle support and repairs.</li>
<li>Design and Construction Services, Engineering Services, and Work Management: Monitor construction sites for safety-related issues. It is expected most projects will be shutdown.</li>
<li>PPDO Business Operations: Efforts concentrated on support to the above-noted activities. The Physical Plant Services work control desk will be operational at (9&#8211;4444) or wodesk@ucsc.edu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your understanding and we apologize for any inconvenience. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our offices through the Physical Plant Services work control desk.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Traci Ferdolage, Associate Vice Chancellor | Physical Planning, Development, and Operations</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="22a58f6b8072701712b15d6e1aee780e"><name>health-services</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student Health Services may be closed May 7–9</title><summary>At this time, we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus.

The prestigious award recognizes Wasson&#8217;s extraordinary commitment to the conservation and restoration of our nation&#8217;s wetlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recipients of the National Wetlands Awards are on the forefront of protecting wetland resources in the face of development and climate impacts,&#8221; said Scott Fulton, president of the Environmental Law Institute. &#8220;Through their dedication and achievements, they inspire wetlands protection across the country and worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>For more than 18 years, Wasson has distinguished herself as a researcher, conservationist, and mentor at the Elkhorn Slough Reserve, one of California&#8217;s few remaining coastal wetlands and the largest tract of tidal salt marsh south of San Francisco Bay, and as a leader of collaborative projects that span the network of National Estuarine Research Reserves.</p>
<p><strong>Secret weapon</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We have a secret weapon to help protect our nation&#8217;s estuaries&#8212;Kerstin Wasson,&#8221; said Elkhorn Slough Reserve manager Dave Feliz. &#8220;She thinks deeply about estuarine issues, initiates and implements investigations into these issues, applies the findings toward solutions-based actions, and communicates all aspects of the process in an engaging and effective manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wasson&#8217;s work at the Elkhorn Slough Reserve includes developing and implementing comprehensive long-term monitoring programs, facilitating research by other scientists, mentoring student researchers, informing coastal decision-makers, and guiding an ambitious ecosystem-based management initiative to restore vanishing tidal wetlands. In addition to these responsibilities, Wasson also maintains her own active research projects in wetland conservation, focusing on threats to estuarine ecosystems and species.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m passionate about taking care of Elkhorn Slough, one small, special wetland. But a lot of the joy in my work comes from being part of a collaborative network of folks who are passionate about their special wetlands, across the 29 National Estuarine Research Reserves,&#8221; Wasson said.</p>
<p>With her counterpart from the Rhode Island National Estuarine Reserve, Wasson led a national assessment of salt marsh resilience to sea level rise, synthesizing consistently collected data from 15 reserves in a publication that received national attention. Now Wasson and her colleagues are conducting replicated restoration experiments at eight of these reserves to test strategies for enhancing salt marsh resilience in the face of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Pioneering work</strong></p>
<p>Wasson also leads pioneering work on the ecology and restoration of native oysters in California bays and estuaries, and she has developed a network of collaborators on the Pacific coast, from Baja California to British Columbia, who have authored a series of publications for scientific and management audiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Science is essential not just for detecting threats, but for testing solutions. Both matter, but focusing on the former leads to pessimism, while the latter fosters hope and moves us forward,&#8221; Wasson said.</p>
<p>As a key part of her work at the Elkhorn Slough Reserve, Wasson coordinates a comprehensive long-term monitoring program for Elkhorn Slough, engaging volunteers in all aspects of the work, from collecting water quality data to counting migratory shorebirds to tracking nesting at a heron rookery. With Wasson&#8217;s support and guidance, two of these citizen scientists recently published a peer-reviewed paper on sea otter behavior and ecology in an esteemed scientific journal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of my finest colleagues are volunteers. It is an honor to work with these citizen scientists, and without this community support we could not keep our finger on the pulse of the wetland,&#8221; says Wasson.</p>
<p><strong>Mentoring students</strong></p>
<p>Dovetailing with her work at the reserve, Wasson also mentors graduate students at UC Santa Cruz on thesis subjects ranging from threatened red-legged frogs to sea otters, from eelgrass restoration to salt marsh ecology. With her students and colleagues, Wasson has published five papers in the past two years, as well as coordinating research performed by others. Her evolving effort in conservation science continues to inspire the next generation of researchers and land stewards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Wasson provided mentorship for these projects and students that could not have been provided by anyone else in the department,&#8221; said Pete Raimondi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Since 1989, the National Wetlands Awards Program has honored more than 200 champions of wetlands conservation, recognizing individuals who have demonstrated exceptional effort, innovation, and excellence in wetlands conservation at the regional, state, or local level. In 2013, Mark Silberstein, Executive Director of the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, was honored with the National Wetlands Award for Wetland Community Leader.</p>
<p>The National Wetlands Awards Program is administered by the Environmental Law Institute and supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resource Conservation Service, NOAA Fisheries, and the Federal Highway Administration. A committee of wetlands experts representing federal and state agencies, academia, conservation groups, and private sector organizations selects the Award winners.</p>
<p>The Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (ESNERR) is managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) with funding support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Established in 1972, the National Estuarine Research Reserve System is a national network of 29 sites along our nation&#8217;s coasts. Reserve-based monitoring, research, education, outreach, stewardship, and decision-maker training programs provide much needed information and services to coastal communities.</p>
<p>The Elkhorn Slough Foundation (ESF) is a community-supported non-profit land trust whose mission is to conserve and restore the Elkhorn Slough and its watershed.

<p>Using Europe&#8217;s 8.2-meter Very Large Telescope in Chile, the team studied the atmosphere of the planet WASP-96b when it passed in front of its host star. This enabled the researchers to measure the decrease of starlight caused by the planet and its atmosphere and thereby determine the planet&#8217;s atmospheric composition. The researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0101-7">published their findings May 7 in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>Clouds and hazes are known to exist in the atmospheres of some of the hottest and coldest solar system planets and exoplanets. The presence or absence of clouds and their ability to block light plays an important role in the overall energy budget of planetary atmospheres.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to predict which of these hot atmospheres will have thick clouds. By seeing the full range of possible atmospheres, from very cloudy to nearly cloud-free like WASP-96b, we'll gain a better understanding of what these clouds are made of," explained coauthor Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Just like an individual&#8217;s fingerprints are unique, atoms and molecules have a unique spectral characteristic that can be used to detect their presence in celestial objects. The spectrum of WASP-96b shows the complete fingerprint of sodium, which can only be observed for an atmosphere free of clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking at over twenty exoplanet transit spectra. WASP-96b is the only exoplanet that appears to be entirely cloud-free and shows such a clear sodium signature, making the planet a benchmark for characterization,&#8221; said lead investigator Nikolay Nikolov from the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>WASP-96b is a typical hot gas-giant exoplanet, similar to Saturn in mass but with a much larger radius, exceeding the size of Jupiter by 20 percent. The planet periodically transits a sun-like star 980 light years away in the southern constellation Phoenix, halfway between the southern jewels Fomalhaut (&#945; Piscis Austrini) and Achernar (&#945; Eridani).</p>
<p>It has long been predicted that sodium exists in the atmospheres of hot gas-giant exoplanets, and in a cloud-free atmosphere it would produce spectra that are similar in shape to the profile of a camping tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until now, sodium was revealed either as a very narrow peak or found to be completely missing,&#8221; Nikolov said. &#8220;This is because the characteristic &#8216;tent-shaped&#8217; profile can only be produced deep in the atmosphere of the planet, and for most planets, clouds appear to get in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sodium signature seen in WASP-96b suggests an atmosphere free of clouds. The observation allowed the team to measure how abundant sodium is in the atmosphere of the planet, finding levels similar to those found in our own solar system.</p>
<p>&#8220;WASP-96b will also provide us with a unique opportunity to determine the abundances of other molecules, such as water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, with future observations,&#8221; said coauthor Ernst de Mooij of Dublin City University.</p>
<p>The team aims to look at the signatures of these other molecules in the atmosphere of WASP-96b with the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes as well as with ground-based telescopes.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2d54913f8072701712b15d6eb88a11ef"><name>galloway-alison-online-course</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The bone whisperer</title><summary>Forensic anthropologist Alison Galloway will retire from teaching this year, but her wisdom will live on through new online course that teaches both technical skills and the things you don’t find in textbooks.</summary><start-date>1525473000000</start-date><display-name>The bone whisperer</display-name><path>/2018/05/galloway-alison-online-course</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/galloway-alison-online-course</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1525473905900</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1525809513145</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Faculty Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2_zS5ClDQsA" width="560"></iframe></embed><width/><caption>Professor Alison Galloway talks about teaching forensic anthropology and dealing with the dead.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dead speak to forensic anthropologist and UC Santa Cruz Professor Alison Galloway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mark on the skull of a man&#8217;s body found decomposing in Stanislaus County, for instance, whispered to Galloway that he had been hit on the head. Cut marks on the lower part of his spine told of how his killer had violently stabbed him again and again, and a nick on one of his cervical vertebrae spoke of the way his throat was slit with a knife before he was left to die. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an ugly, torturous death and one that remains in the mind of Galloway, one of the state&#8217;s foremost forensic anthropologists who regularly works 15 to 25 cases a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You realize someone was desperately, probably, trying to stay alive and it wasn&#8217;t like in the movies where someone comes crashing in at the last minute and saves you from the knife blow,&#8221; Galloway says. &#8220;In this case, the knife comes crashing down and nothing saves you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Galloway still has a visceral, almost personal, connection to this victim is a side effect of her job. Often, she says, when she&#8217;s finished her work, she&#8217;ll finds herself filling in the rest of the victim&#8217;s story: the pain and fear someone must have felt as their killer attacked, the loneliness of an old woman as she lay dying in her apartment, and the darkness of the woods as the hiker grew weaker, knowing he or she would never find their way home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s one of the reasons Galloway, who is set to retire from teaching this year (she retired as campus provost and executive vice chancellor in 2016), has created a new online forensic anthropology course. Besides teaching the technical skills&#8212;the examination of bones and teeth&#8212;the course also will enlighten students about the things they don&#8217;t find in textbooks: the connection to the victims, the way it feels to work around human death day after day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;This not a field that should be taken lightly,&#8221; Galloway says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy students from UC Santa Cruz and UC Santa Barbara have already signed up for what some are calling a legacy class that preserves Galloway&#8217;s unique teaching ability even after she leaves the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course, which includes lectures, lab time, and online discussion, covers everything from determining the age, sex, and race of human remains to figuring out how and when someone died. It also examines the legal role of the physical anthropologist, something that has changed dramatically over the past four decades. It is not open to the public, but offers university credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alison is a teacher who brings so much perspective from her long career working as a research-based anthropologist and a practitioner in the field,&#8221; says Michael Tassio (Crown &#8217;03, philosophy), who is assistant director for online education at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;When she talks to students, it comes from a place of deep authenticity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first hint that Galloway is not some academic in an ivory tower is the skeleton artwork on the bulletin board next to her office door. The second is the three-tiered cart next to her desk that is filled with human bones, and the third, in case you missed everything else, is the handmade shirt she&#8217;s wearing that&#8217;s decorated in a colorful pattern of roses and skulls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I sew when I get stressed,&#8221; she says by way of explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galloway started in the relatively new field of forensic anthropology in 1982, becoming interested in bones while studying cultural research management at the University of Arizona and working in nearby O&#8217;odham tribal cemeteries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some people (anthropologists) like tools,&#8221; Galloway says, sitting in her fourth-floor office, the sun dappling the redwoods outside. &#8220;Some like jewelry. Some like art. I just happen to like bones. There is something about them. They are the people who actually lived, not what they made or what they ate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1988, she was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where one of her jobs was to run the infamous Body Farm, a field of donated corpses that forensic anthropologists use to advance their research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She came to UC Santa Cruz in 1990 and was certified by the American Board of Forensic Anthropologists. Over the years she has examined the bodies of suicide victims, people who slipped off cliffs or got lost in the woods, people who died alone and forgotten at home, and people who were violently killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her most publicized case was the murder of Laci Peterson, a pregnant woman who disappeared from Modesto in 2002 and whose body was later found in the San Francisco Bay. Galloway was asked to determine the age of Peterson&#8217;s fetus and reported it was still in Peterson&#8217;s womb when she died. Peterson&#8217;s husband was convicted of two counts of murder and sentenced to death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It does have an impact on the way you think about life,&#8221; Galloway says of her work. &#8220;You see how quickly life gets snuffed out in some situations. How there is a very thin line between life and death.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why does she continue? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because there are dead bodies that need to be examined, dead bodies that still speak,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halloween will be her last day at work (and, yes, she sees the coincidence in that), but while she says she is looking forward to retiring to the Gold Country where she&#8217;ll have more room for her horses and dogs, she worried that she would be replaced by someone who would teach from a textbook rather than from experience in the field. Right now, she says, she is the only active and board-certified forensic anthropologist in the UC system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This (the online course) is my swan song,&#8221; she says, &#8220;My way of saying, &#8216;Look here, I&#8217;ll give you a good run of information from someone who is active in the field.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, the campus&#8217;s online education department not only spent about 300 hours filming and producing the course but also helped develop a hands-on lab component, which Galloway believes is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galloway picks up a humerus, an arm bone, to demonstrate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students aren&#8217;t used to handling three-dimensional material,&#8221; she says, turning the bone in her hands. &#8220;They are more familiar with two dimensions: computer screens, phone screens, paper.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She twists the bone sideways and taps her finger against three knob-like bumps on one end of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The capitulum, the trochlea, the medial epicondyle,&#8221; she says, noting that students are often able to recognize the entire bone from illustrations &#8220;but if they only see these (smaller parts), they can&#8217;t figure out what it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handling an actual human bone is the only way to remedy that, she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tassio sees Galloway&#8217;s online course as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;an example of how master teachers can leverage technology to provide high-quality lectures, and to make meaningful use of class time. Her students interact with the online content, and then they come to lab eager to demonstrate their new knowledge and skills.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As much as we can break down barriers for new and more students, that&#8217;s exciting for me,&#8221; Tassio says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course will be offered again in the summer and is funded as part of the UC system&#8217;s $10 million Innovative Learning Technology Initiative.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Classes held entirely online.</li>
<li>Classes in which the instructor has made alternate arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructors are encouraged to communicate directly with their students to let them know whether classes are proceeding with alternate arrangements or whether class is cancelled. Students are encouraged to look for emails from their instructors with guidance for their courses. Instructors and students should reach out to the <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu">Disability Resource Center</a> for support and assistance with accessibility needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, faculty, students, and staff should not come to main campus, given that access is significantly impacted at this time. Staff members should check in with supervisors and managers to discuss their schedules and alternate work locations.</p>
<p>Our operations continue as scheduled at other sites.</p>
<p>I will send an email update at 10 a.m. as to whether classes will be held later today and whether the main campus is accessible.</p>
<p>I understand the disruption this causes to our mission, especially in the midst of our spring quarter. Union leaders rejected, without conducting a vote among their members, UC&#8217;s proposal, and chose to strike.</p>

Joel passed away in the early morning hours of April 18, 2018.</p>
<p class="western">Joel earned a B.A. in physics from UC Berkeley in 1980 and a Ph.D. in applied physics from Cornell University in 1985. His research interests included micro-electro-mechanical systems and adaptive optics. He made significant contributions to the field of biological imaging by using adaptive optics techniques originally developed for astronomy.</p>
<p class="western">Joel joined the Baskin School of Engineering during the 2004-05 academic year as a faculty member in the Electrical Engineering Department. He brought many qualities to the department: a creative approach to research, a passion for teaching and mentoring, and a keen sense of how to leverage technology for positive societal impact. His pioneering work in the field of adaptive optical microscopy for biological imaging is a perfect example of the creative and inspired research in which Joel engaged.</p>
<p class="western">In 2012, Joel became chair of the EE department, a position he held for five years. During this period, Joel worked tirelessly to shape and expand the department, playing a key role in advocating for and hiring five new faculty members. Joel will be sorely missed by his students and colleagues.</p>
<p class="western">The Baskin School of Engineering and the Electrical Engineering Department will host a celebration of Joel&#8217;s life on Tuesday, June 19, 2018, from 2 to 4 p.m. in the La Feliz Room at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.

<br/>
<div>The university is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations which include picketing.</div>
<br/>
<div>It is equally important to know that these rights are subject to restrictions based on time, place, and manner rules. For example, UC policy does not allow free expression to disrupt the regular and essential operations of the university, to significantly infringe on the rights of others, or to block or impede ingress to or egress from the campus or buildings. When free expression disrupts our ability to offer classes, carry on research, or run the university in general&#8212;or when it violates university policy or the law in any way&#8212;then it may be subject to disciplinary consequences.</div>
<br/>
<div>Additionally, please remember that no employee is ever obligated to strike. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Staff members should remain in contact with their supervisors and managers to discuss their schedules and work locations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor or your campus employee and labor relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Finally, the university has learned that some unions have threatened to fine union members who do not participate in the strike. Some unions have the right to fine members, but not non-members, who choose to work during a strike, including a sympathy strike. If you don&#8217;t want to strike, you may want to contact your local union representative to confirm there will not be fines. Even if the union does levy fines, UC will not deduct union fines from employees&#8217; paychecks.</div>
<br/>
<div>Though we do not know how these strike activities will impact the operation of our campus, we are working to do everything we can to ensure continued operations.</div>
<br/>
<div>It is anticipated that <a href="https://dining.ucsc.edu/special-hours/index.html">dining halls</a> may not have adequate staffing to serve prepared food during this time. We also anticipate that all cafes and restaurants operated by UCSC Dining may be closed.</div>
<br/>
<div>Additionally, it&#8217;s possible that Student Health Services may be closed during the strike. The health center has recommended that students proactively take care of any immediate health care needs. However, please know that the campus has taken measures to give students access to counseling services even if Student Health Services is closed. More information is <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/possible_closure.html">online</a>.</div>
<br/>
<div>Real-time updates about the strike and campus operations will be posted at <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/advisory">ucsc.edu/advisory</a> beginning early Monday, May 7.</div>

If proceeding with alternate arrangements, instructors and students should reach out to the Disability Resource Center for support and assistance with accessibility needs, if needed.&#160;<br/><br/>Faculty, staff, and students can return to campus, though some services and offices may not be open.<br/><br/>Staff members should check in with supervisors and managers to discuss returning to main campus or continuing with alternate work locations.<br/><br/>With the strike expected to continue Tuesday, I plan to send another early morning update to advise our campus community.

<p><span>As we approach <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1940066672" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ">tomorrow</span></span> and the uncertainty it brings in being able to access our campus, we want to share again the following guidance to help you and your employees:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong><span> - Employees are expected to work their normal schedules on May 8, 9, and 10th. Please instruct your employees to check campus accessibility before they come to work. Employees who can safely come to campus should do so in accordance with information disseminated from the campus&#8217; website. Information will be posted on a special web site: </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.ucsc.edu/advisory/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525877207888000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlGDXNNmjYVGhmBgU135wdUTZBZQ" href="https://www.ucsc.edu/advisory/">ucsc.edu/advisory/</a><span>, recorded on the campus communication hotline (459-INFO), provided to KZSC Radio (88.1 FM) for broadcast, and shared via the campus Twitter account (</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://twitter.com/%23!/ucsc&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525877207888000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErjGRklfMTvgS4Q3-ey-5vlze3kg" href="https://twitter.com/ucsc">twitter.com/ucsc</a><span>). If access to the campus is not possible, further instructions to employees will be posted via these channels.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Work Flexibility</strong><span> - In order to minimize the number of people attempting to access the campus, employee requests to work from home or for an alternate work site may be considered and approved based on operational needs. We encourage you to be as flexible as possible when considering these requests from your employees.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request for Vacation or Compensatory Time Off (CTO)</strong><span> - Managers and supervisors may approve advance requests to schedule vacation or CTO (overtime leave) in accordance with policy and labor agreements and as it is customarily administered within your unit/division. Employees requesting vacation or CTO due to concerns about their safety should be granted the time off.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request for Sick Leave</strong><span> - You may require that employees provide reasonable documentation to support their request for sick leave if the requested day off is concurrent with the strike day. Managers and supervisors should notify employees within a reasonable period of time before the strike that medical documentation will be required.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request for Union Business Leave</strong><span> - Please forward the employee's request to the Employee &amp; Labor Relations' Administrative Specialist, Jennifer May, at 459-1873 or <a href="mailto:jemay@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jemay@ucsc.edu</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absence without Approval</strong><span> - If the campus is accessible and an employee is absent without advance approval to use vacation or compensatory time off and has not called in sick, then the day should be recorded as an unapproved absence and the employee's pay will be adjusted in accordance with policy and labor agreements.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recording Attendance</strong><span> - Employee attendance will be reported as normal through Cruz Pay and other time reporting practices. In order to assess the impact of the strike, we may ask supervisors or units to provide additional information on absences for a report to the Office of the President.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Absence due to Inaccessibility</strong><span> - If the campus is officially determined to be inaccessible, the Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor may approve administrative leave with pay for those employees who are expected to work but are unable to access the workplace. Employees should not be encouraged to enter the campus to work nor should they be transported onto campus if it is deemed inaccessible by the Police Chief.</span></li>
<li><strong>Health and Safety</strong><span> - It is important to ensure that your employees are advised that their safety is always the first priority. &#160;Employees should not be expected to jeopardize their safety in attempting to get to work </span><i><span>if access to the campus is blocked</span></i><span>. Please emphasize to your employees that they should follow the directions regarding campus access that will be communicated through the channels noted above. If your employees needs further assistance, you may direct them to contact &#160;the </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/EAP.flyer.English.2016.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525877207888000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrBdTNmwwQ-O81fQVLMiXzUXOTSQ" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/EAP.flyer.English.2016.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Employee Assistance Program</span></a><span> or their </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/elr-staff-directory.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525877207888000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJSckfltMwVnovq2A4CSrQ0q65tw" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/elr-staff-directory.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst</span></a><span> to discuss questions or concerns. &#160;</span></li>
<li><strong>Class Scheduling</strong><span> - Academic employees are expected to perform research and instructional duties as normal. Department chairs have the delegated authority to reschedule or relocate a class in order to ensure effective delivery of the academic program. Rescheduling or relocation must follow established departmental practice and accommodate the needs of the instructor and all students in the class, keeping in mind that students may experience difficulty finding transportation onto or off campus. Instructors who cancel classes not in accordance with departmental practice may be subject to discipline, consistent with applicable rules and policy. If the campus is officially determined to be inaccessible, the Chancellor may cancel classes, and this will be communicated through the channels noted above.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>If the campus is open and accessible, we encourage you to do your best to balance our need to provide on-site services with your team&#8217;s comfort with passing through the demonstrations. Some employees have felt anxiety and we want to take their comfort into consideration.</span></p>
<p><span>Strike related questions should be forwarded to your Employee &amp; Labor Relations Analyst at </span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525877207889000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHL1eNvfVWjpIJnGOae91MM5lw8IQ" href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/elr/">shr.ucsc.edu/elr/</a><span> or email: <a href="mailto:elrinfo@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">elrinfo@ucsc.edu</a>.</span></p>

I know our students earnestly value your efforts on their behalf. I understand it was a challenging day for some people in our campus community. Like today, we hope to provide guidance in the early morning hours.</div>
<strong><br/></strong>
<div>As we approach tomorrow and the uncertainty it brings in being able to access our campus, I want to share again the options you have for ensuring instructional delivery.</div>
<strong><br/></strong>
<div>Unit heads are authorized to reschedule or relocate a class in order to ensure effective delivery of the academic program. Rescheduling or relocation can be arranged in advance, but must follow established practice and accommodate the needs of the instructor and all students in the class, keeping in mind that students may have difficulty finding transportation to or from main campus. Please remember that it is policy that unit heads and instructors may not preemptively cancel classes. Instructors who are not able to teach a scheduled course during the strike should seek authorization from their unit head, who may make alternative arrangements for the course.</div>
<strong><br/></strong>
<div>Information Technology Services (ITS) has provided a solution for our instructors and students to continue their scheduled learning when the possibility of physical presence is not available. The video communication software Zoom is used throughout UC Santa Cruz and, in some classes, may meet the needs for an immediate temporary solution. Instructors and students should reach out to the <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a> for support and assistance with accessibility needs.</div>
<strong><br/></strong>
<div>In advance, it is recommended that instructors go through the attached quick set of self-help directions.</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>The instructor will need to follow the directions in Sections A-E on the self-help directions to start a Zoom session for their class.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>If the instructor wants to delegate the management of the Zoom session to a TA, they will need to follow the last bullet of Section D Step 4 (where "TACruzID" is replaced with the TA's actual CruzID).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Students can access the meeting through instructions provided in Section F</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Instructions for managing the Zoom session are in Section G.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div><br/>Instructors should also review the information the ITS Faculty Instructional Technology Center (FITC) has provided to ensure the best possible outcome for their teaching scenarios.</div>

<div><br/>I appreciate your efforts during this time, and I remain hopeful that the UC system and the labor union will soon come to a mutually agreeable resolution. Questions should be directed to your department chair, program chair, or college provost.</div>

<p>The event offers the community a chance to explore the 50th anniversary of 1968, a tumultuous year of protests and revolutionary movements around the world, and consider what lessons can be drawn for politics and protest today.</p>
<p>Featuring a panel of four guest historians moderated by UC Santa Cruz associate history professor Marc Matera, the evening will focus on marginalized groups and lesser-known events in 1968&#8212;from Oakland to West Africa, and Mexico to China&#8212;examining the disruptions of 1968 from a global perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;1968 is such a big year in U.S. history because of the racial tensions, activism, assassinations, and student protests against Vietnam,&#8221; noted history professor Greg O&#8217;Malley, director of the campus&#8217;s Center for World History. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a history that Santa Cruz feels very connected to. But lots of Americans are less aware that it was a big year for similar kinds of tumult around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hoping to take a history that local people think is familiar&#8212;1960s radicalism&#8212;and give them a new perspective on it by connecting the American version of it to events and trends elsewhere,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Thinking about the global nature of the unrest raises important questions about causes that can&#8217;t be answered by looking only at domestic factors. It can&#8217;t be a coincidence that the whole world was wrapped in this at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initiated and organized by the Center for World History (CWH), the event is part of the Humanities Institute&#8217;s <em>Freedom and Race Series</em>, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. O&#8217;Malley explained that the CWH sees its role as pushing historians, and others interested in history, to think outside the national frames in which we so often approach history.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a tendency to want to make everything an American (or a French, or a Chinese) story,&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley. &#8220;But many historical phenomena are transnational or global. Social movements and cultural trends (not to mention microbes and even people) cross borders relatively easily, so framing historical stories nationally often obscures important parts of the picture."</p>
<p>The evening will include a pop-up exhibition of images from a 1968 photography project launched by artist Ruth-Marion Baruch to document the people and the work of California&#8217;s Black Panther Party. At the time, the photographs she and her husband Pirkle Jones took of the Panthers were both lauded and harshly criticized for their sympathetic portrayal of a maligned community.</p>
<p><em>Black Panthers, 1968</em>&#160;is one of many projects revealing Baruch&#8217;s and Jones&#8217;s commitment to art and social change that were <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/jones-baruch-gift.html"><em><strong>donated</strong></em></a> in 2016 to UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Special Collections &amp; Archives in McHenry Library.</p>
<p>The panelists for the event will be:</p>
<p><strong>Donna Murch</strong>&#8212;Associate professor of history at Rutgers University, she is the author of the award-winning book, <em>Living for the City: Migration, Education and the Rise of the Black Panther Party in Oakland</em>, <em>California</em>, as well as numerous articles and essays, including &#8220;Ferguson&#8217;s Inheritance&#8221; on the historical continuities between the Watts rebellion and recent protests in the St. Louis metro area. Her research is also featured in award-winning filmmaker Stanley Nelson&#8217;s Black Panther Party documentary, <em>Vanguard of the Revolution</em>. She is currently completing a new book entitled <em>Crack in Los Angeles: Policing the Crisis and the War on Drugs</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Jaime Pensado</strong>&#8212;Associate professor of history at Notre Dame University, he is the author of <em>Rebel Mexico: Student Unrest and Authoritarian Political Culture During the Long Sixties</em> (Stanford University Press, 2013), as well as many articles and essays on the history of youth protest in Mexico during the 1960s.</p>
<p><strong>Emily Honig</strong>&#8212;Professor of history at UC Santa Cruz, her research and teaching focus on gender, sexuality, and ethnicity in modern Chinese history. She is the author of <em>Creating Chinese Ethnicity: Subei People in Shanghai, 1850-1980</em>. More recently, she has published a number of essays on gender in the Chinese Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p><strong>Jean Allman</strong>&#8212;Professor of history and J. H. Hexter Professor in the Humanities at Washington University in St. Louis, she is also the director of the Danforth Center for the Humanities. Allman is the author of <em>I Will Not Eat Stone: A Women&#8217;s History of Colonial Asante</em> and most recently, with John Parker, <em>TONGNAAB: The History of a West African God</em>.

<p>Carter is a professor of physics, and the Narinder Kapany Professor in Entrepreneurship. She's also the associate dean of the Division of Graduate Studies and the director for the <a href="https://cied.ucsc.edu/index.html">Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development</a>. She joined UC Santa Cruz in 1995.</p>
<p>Carter said her vision for Rachel Carson College is to strengthen its role in supporting students as they seek to create a more sustainable future and make it a place for them to gain skills needed for green careers in which they can develop sustainable innovations to preserve the environment.</p>
<p>The college <a href="../../2016/09/rachel-carson-college.xml">was named</a> in 2016 in honor of Rachel Carson, a writer and conservationist who is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to continue the legacy and vision built by the college&#8217;s previous provosts and empowered by the Webster Foundation&#8217;s transformation gift,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;I plan to work beside our students, staff, faculty, alumni, and greater sustainability-focused community to make Rachel Carson College a leader in innovation at the interface between the environment and society."</p>
<p>In the last decade, Carter has served as the chief technical advisor and/or scientific founder at four start-up companies, including Add-vision, Solexant (now Siva Power), Soliculture and IRIS Science Academy and has also served as a scientific advisor to companies like Nitto Denko and Integrated Biometrics. She has also worked as a research staff member at several companies, including General Motors, UpJohn (now Pfizer), AT&amp;T/Lucent Bell Laboratories and IBM Almaden Research Center. She is a recipient of the 1996 Packard Fellowship and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sue is a perfect fit to Rachel Carson College,&#8221; said Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Richard Hughey. &#8220;She has been dedicated to undergraduate opportunities to make a difference through research, entrepreneurship, and creativity since her time as an assistant professor, and has been closely involved in the college&#8217;s minor in sustainability studies.&#8221;</p>
<p>With more than 100 publications, Carter&#8217;s research focuses on thin film optoelectronic technologies, solid state lighting, biosensors, solar energy, and the integration of these technologies with agriculture.</p>
<p>She has served as a board member of the UC Energy Institute and California Solar Collaborative, the Chair of the American Physics Society Group for Energy Research and Applications, and currently serves as member of the UCOP Applied Research Working Group for the Carbon Neutrality Initiative. She was the 2016 recipient of UCSC&#8217;s Climate Champion Award, was the main organizer for the UC-wide Carbon Slam, and is the founder of the Sustainability Lab (S-lab), which provides a facility for UC Santa Cruz students to pursue research projects and innovations related to sustainability.</p>
<p>As Rachel Carson College provost, Carter will oversee academic programs including the minor in sustainability studies, the core course component of the Academic Literacy Curriculum, service learning associated with the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, and the awarding of degrees. She will also join the Council of Provosts, the body that continuously focuses on student outcomes and experiences within the colleges, the campus&#8217;s distinctive communities of scholarship.</p>
<p>She will continue to serve as director of the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4b3a0cb18072701712b15d6e58462f2f"><name>resuming-standard-operations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Resuming standard campus operations</title><summary>As the last day of the AFSCME labor demonstration winds down, UC Santa Cruz expects to resume normal campus operations tomorrow (May 10). </summary><start-date>1525892400000</start-date><display-name>Resuming standard campus operations</display-name><path>/2018/05/resuming-standard-operations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/resuming-standard-operations</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1525975484551</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1525975528910</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As the last day of the AFSCME labor demonstration winds down, UC Santa Cruz expects to resume normal campus operations tomorrow (May 10). </span></p>

<span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span>While there have been additional law enforcement officers to help ensure public safety during this week&#8217;s labor action, there have been no federal immigration officers.<strong style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal;"><strong style="color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal;"><span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><br/></strong></span></strong></strong>
<p>UC Police <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/uc-principles.html">policy</a> does not allow our officers to contact, detain, question or arrest individuals based on suspected undocumented status, or to enter agreements to undertake joint efforts to make arrests for federal immigration law violations. Moreover, ICE has a <a href="https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2017/03/ice-sensitive-locations-policy">policy</a> that directs their agents to avoid taking enforcement actions at locations such as schools, including college and university campuses.</p>
<span face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"></span>Nonetheless, we want to acknowledge the anxiety and stress that such rumors can cause for our students and our greater community.

<p>King and Woodfox will be joined in conversation on May 22 by Distinguished Professor Emerita Angela Davis for a panel discussion about the future of criminal justice reform. The conversation will be moderated by Distinguished Professor of Psychology Craig Haney, who holds a UC Presidential Chair. The event begins at 5:30 p.m. in the Bhojwani Room in University Center; admission is free, but seating is limited.&#160;<span>The event will be available for livestreaming <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/criminal-justice-reform/">here</a>. </span></p>
<p>Davis, a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/01/2015-mlk-convocation-preview.html">UC Santa Cruz professor emerita</a> of history of consciousness and feminist studies, is widely recognized for her scholarship on mass incarceration and her advocacy on behalf of civil rights, feminist, and prison issues.</p>
<p>Also participating in the discussion will be Debbie Kilroy, an Australian prison activist and the founder of "<a href="https://www.sistersinside.com.au/">Sisters Inside</a>," an international organization that advocates on behalf of women in prison. Kilroy, who has been called one of the world&#8217;s "leading voices on the human rights of criminalized women," is the first formerly incarcerated person in Australia to become a practicing lawyer.</p>
<p>"It's rare to have the opportunity to hear from those who have been most impacted by the worst injustices of our criminal justice system, as well two of the most powerful advocates for radical change," said Haney, co-director of the UC Criminal Justice &amp; Health Consortium. "It's an honor to provide a platform for Robert King, Albert Woodfox, Angela Davis, and Debbie Kilroy."</p>
<p>Haney is a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/haney-research-lecture.html">leading expert</a> on the psychological effects of incarceration&#8212;particularly solitary confinement&#8212;whose testimony has played a key role in numerous <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/01/haney-canada.html">court rulings</a> calling for improved conditions inside prisons. His book, <em>Reforming Punishment: Psychological Limits to the Pains of Imprisonment</em>, was nominated for a National Book Award.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful for the opportunity to convene this remarkable group of activists and advocates," added Haney. "The evening promises to be an enlightening one for those who are able to attend."</p>

One of the most beloved works in the operatic canon, it will be sung in German with dialogues and supertitles in English. <br/><br/>The UC Santa Cruz production is directed by music lecturer Sheila Willey, with assistant professor of music Bruce Kiesling conducting the University Orchestra.<br/><br/>&#8220;Over 100 people have worked to bring this production of Magic Flute to life: playing in the pit, singing on stage, creating complicated costumes, running the lighting board, coaching the German, designing posters, promoting our performances, and countless other essential tasks,&#8221; said Willey. <br/><br/>&#8220;We have been hoping to program a Mozart opera for quite some time,&#8221; she added. <br/><br/>&#8220;This music is remarkably accessible to young singers, and my colleagues and I are delighted to be able to provide this opportunity for our students. It has been a thrill to watch how our singers respond to this glorious score in which we are constantly finding messages small and large from the composer about characterization, stage direction, and how to express some of humanity&#8217;s most base and elevated emotions.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz is also joining forces with the Academy of Art University in San Francisco to create costumes for the production. The Academy&#8217;s Alina Bokavikova explained how that partnership came about. <br/><br/>&#8220;The collaboration between Academy of Art University&#8217;s costume design program and UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s opera program began last year when I was asked to design UCSC&#8217;s 2017 production, <em>Orpheus in The Underworld</em>,&#8221; said Bokavikova. &#8220;Having recently been appointed to the position of costume design coordinator at the Academy of Art, I decided to extend this incredible design opportunity to our students for resume credit.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;This experiment created a stunning work of art last spring, with exquisite production value and performances, so opera director Sheila Willey invited our students to return this year to design <em>The Magic Flute</em>.&#8221; &#160;<br/><br/>Exploring themes of chaos, order, and the natural world, <em>The&#160;Magic Flute</em>&#160;is basically a fairy tale, with themes of love and &#8220;good versus evil.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Or as undergraduate dramaturg Magda Travis put it, &#8220;At its core, <em>The Magic Flute</em> is about enlightenment, and the effect that knowledge has on how we view the world around us.&#8221;<br/><br/>____________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><em><strong>The Magic Flute</strong> will run from Thursday to Saturday, May 31- June 2, beginning at 7:30 p.m. There will also be a Sunday, June 3, matinee starting at 3 p.m. All performances will take place at the Music Center Recital Hall.

<p>The agenda of the meeting may be reviewed <a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/senate-meetings/agendas-minutes/2017-2018/2018-may-16-meeting/index.html">online</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>The agenda will focus on important topics up for divisional review, approval, and discussion. The highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an update from campus leadership</li>
<li>the announcement of the 2019 Faculty Research Lecturer</li>
<li>a report on faculty salaries (including gender and ethnicity salary gaps) and updates on faculty<br/>childcare from the Committee on Faculty Welfare (CFW)</li>
<li>a report and solicitation for feedback by the Committee on Teaching (COT) regarding student<br/>evaluations of teaching</li>
<li>Committee on Educational Policy (CEP) recommendations on the Kresge classrooms</li>
<li>regulation and bylaw updates from CEP and the Committee on Library and Scholarly Communication<br/>(COLASC)</li>
<li>Reports from the Student Union Assembly (SUA) and Graduate Student Association (GSA)</li>
<li><a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/academic-plan/index.html">Strategic Academic Planning</a> (SAP) updates, followed by Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>
<p>This has been an exciting year on campus as we engage on multiple fronts to define our campus identity in terms of shape and research foci. It is more important than ever to stay connected and informed. As you know, the campus is undertaking both Strategic Academic Planning (SAP) and Long Range Development Planning (LRDP), and the Baskin School of Engineering is undergoing reshaping. Childcare for faculty is slated to open as early as Fall 2019. Those of us serving in the Senate are asked nearly every week to opine on critical campus issues related to different committees&#8217; purviews as well as from a more general faculty perspective.</p>
<p>In this context, I would like to thank all our faculty members currently serving on Senate and special committees for their service. I truly appreciate the hard work you have put into various committee issues and projects. Your service is invaluable to the campus. I also want to thank all of you who have participated in various focus groups and surveys conducted by the LRDP, SAP, Committee on Career Advising (CCA), Center for Teaching and Learning (CITL), and many more.&#160;Additionally, I want to thank Chancellor Blumenthal, CP/EVC Tromp, and other administrators for their collaborations with the Senate.</p>
<p>I am grateful for having had the privilege of serving as Academic Senate Chair over the past two years, and I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday, May 16th for my final meeting as chair.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>For the third year, a video by Distinguished Professor of Psychology Barbara Rogoff is featured in the "2018 STEM for All Video Showcase" hosted by the National Science Foundation (NSF).</p>
<p>Rogoff's 3-minute video, "<a href="http://stemforall2018.videohall.com/presentations/1318">Learning by Helping</a>," is part of NSF's annual competition showcasing innovative projects that seek to improve learning and teaching in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the so-called "STEM fields." The videos highlight initiatives for students of all ages, kindergarten through graduate school, as well as for adult learners.</p>
<p>Rogoff's submission shows California schoolchildren interacting with a science instructor and highlights the helpfulness of children from Mexican immigrant families who have not had much schooling. These children are more likely than their middle-class European American peers to spontaneously help the instructor, and their mothers report that they also voluntarily pitch in and help at home, according to Rogoff.</p>
<p>"Helping others may be a powerful motivator for children to engage in science," said Rogoff. "This may be especially true for children from underrepresented backgrounds." Although teachers often discourage children from helping them, changing classroom practices could help to broaden children&#8217;s participation in science, she said. Rogoff's former graduate students Ang&#233;lica L&#243;pez Fraire and Luc&#237;a Alcal&#225; are featured as co-presenters in the video.</p>
<p>Rogoff's video is available for viewing May 14-21 as part of NSF's annual competition; viewers are invited to vote for their favorite video and join an online discussion about the submissions.</p>
<p>Rogoff's team has submitted videos that have taken top public awards in the previous two years. Her work is funded by NSF and the University of California.</p>

Like other University of California campuses, we are not immune. In 2016, 44 percent of UC undergraduates and 26 percent of UC graduate students reported having experienced food insecurity. At present, leadership from all ten UC campuses are working together to address food and housing insecurity at the local and system-wide level.</p>
<p>We are pleased to share that Cowell College and Dining Services are moving forward in partnership with the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) to transform the Cowell Coffee Shop into a multi-service basic needs cafe with extended weekend hours, that will maintain a study space for students coupled with free coffee and tea and a food pantry.</p>
<p>The basic premise is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower part of the cafe would remain a student study space with free coffee and tea, plus a variety of programming options focused on nutrition, financial wellness, CalFresh workshops, cooking skills workshops, etc.</li>
<li>The upper part of the cafe&#8212;the kitchen&#8212;would serve as a food pantry and demonstration kitchen for student programming.</li>
<li>The transactional nature of the cafe would change&#8212;no longer will students be able to purchase food and beverage in the cafe, but instead the space will offer basic needs services for free to any UCSC student.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision to transform the Cowell Coffee Shop comes after extensive engagement with constituent groups which included student forums, faculty and staff consultation, and engagement with Cowell alumni. Throughout the consultation process, feedback about the proposal was very positive.</p>
<p>Planning is ongoing and will continue through the summer. The transformed Cowell Coffee Shop will open in Fall 2018 to begin serving students as soon as classes resume.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Carolyn Golz, College Administrative Officer for Cowell and Stevenson Colleges; Bill Prime, Dining Director;  Tim Galarneau, Food Systems Education &amp; Research Program Specialist, CASFS</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="654f4fc98072701712b15d6e429c5c14"><name>violence-santa-cruz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Spate of violence in greater Santa Cruz area</title><summary>Following a stabbing and a fatal shooting near the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, and additional incidents in the Soquel area, I want to remind members of our campus community to be aware of your surroundings.</summary><start-date>1526281200000</start-date><display-name>Spate of violence in greater Santa Cruz area</display-name><path>/2018/05/violence-santa-cruz</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/violence-santa-cruz</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1526413085455</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1526413520601</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Following a stabbing and a fatal shooting near the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, and additional incidents in the Soquel area, I want to remind members of our campus community to be aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious behavior, particularly if you&#8217;re in any of the areas where this violence occurred. </span></p>

The project includes about 3,000 beds, and will serve upper-division undergraduates, graduate students, and students with families, as well as expand child-care services to all students, faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>On Friday, May 11, the public comment period for the project draft Environmental Impact Report closed. In the 45-day period, we received more than 200 comments, some in support of the project, others sharing concerns. In addition, many in our campus community have reached out to us outside the formal commenting forums, offering their thoughts on the development.</p>
<p>As a result of this feedback, it has become clear to us that having a more robust discussion about the proposed project, and particularly alternatives to the proposed project, is necessary before moving forward. To this end, we have decided to extend the comment period to June 27, 2018. We will hold additional information sessions in May, as well as two more public hearings, on June 6 and 7.</p>
<p>Following the end of the extended public comment period on June 27, the university will evaluate all comments, from both the original comment period and the extended one, with our project goals in mind. Among them: maintaining affordable housing for students, minimizing environmental impacts, and mitigating the displacement of students with families.</p>
<p>To ensure we have sufficient time to properly consider the public&#8217;s input, we will also be postponing presentation of the project to the Board of Regents until sometime after we have charted our next steps.</p>
<p>Extension of the comment period will inevitably delay the start of construction and push back project completion. However, we value our community&#8217;s input and want to ensure that those with different ideas on the path forward have their feedback carefully considered.</p>
<p>Comments during the extended period must be sent to Alisa Klaus, UC Santa Cruz, Physical &amp; Environmental Planning Services, 1156 High St , Barn G, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, or <a href="mailto:eircomment@ucsc.edu">emailed to eircomment@ucsc.edu</a>. During the extended period, we will share additional information learned since release of the Draft EIR, including information regarding costs. Public comments will also be received at additional public hearings scheduled for June 6 and 7. The locations and times will be announced soon. Any information learned since release of the Draft EIR will also be disclosed in the Final EIR.</p>
<p>We remain committed to offering our students more affordable-housing options, relieving overcrowding on campus, and also easing pressure on the greater Santa Cruz-area housing market. We believe that by extending the public comment period we can better understand the concerns of our community and explore proposed alternatives and project modifications with the goal of developing broader consensus on the right path forward, helping us to achieve both of those goals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6a62367d8072701712b15d6e6f7bc56b"><name>service-animals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Guidance about Service and Emotional Support Animals at UCSC</title><summary>We have assembled a number of resources that aim to clarify when and where service and emotional support animals are allowed on campus and answer the most common questions we receive.</summary><start-date>1526454000000</start-date><display-name>Guidance about Service and Emotional Support Animals at UCSC</display-name><path>/2018/05/service-animals</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/service-animals</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1526498210369</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1526498288334</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>Over the past few years, the number of service and approved emotional support animals at UCSC has increased substantially.

Sciences</strong></em></a> will present the opening reception for <strong><em>Future Garden for the Central Coast of California</em></strong>--a site-specific environmental art installation by UCSC emeritus arts research professors Newton Harrison and his late wife Helen Mayer Harrison--on May 19, at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and Botanic Garden.<br/><br/>Working in tandem with botanists at the Arboretum--along with other artists, scientists, and students--the Harrisons have created trial gardens inside three refabricated geodesic domes, where native plant species are being exposed to the temperatures and water conditions that have been projected for the region in the near future. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to determine which plants will thrive as the area warms due to climate change, and to cultivate those species to create the foundation for a more rapid regeneration of the local ecosystem while temperatures shift.<br/><br/>As Newton&#160;Harrison has noted, the future for a rapidly warming planet lies in finding durable plant species that together create ecosystems that can continue to live and flourish as temperatures increase.&#160; <br/><br/>Sixteen plant species were chosen for the project from the major eco-regions of California&#8217;s central coast, all selected for their resilience to drought, variable rainfall, and temperature extremes. The three different domes will each have different watering regimes to test the effects of drought.<br/><br/>Signage at the installation notes that &#8220;this is a 50-year experiment focused on building a diverse group of plants that can be propagated and moved into our heat-shocked region&#8230;We expect some species will die off and we will replace them with new species in order to generate the most resilient ensemble possible."<br/><br/>&#8221;The Harrisons have collaborated as artists since the late 1960s, working with biologists, ecologists, architects, urban planners and other artists to propose sustainable solutions to ecological challenges and the crisis posed by climate change.Their projects have been shown in major exhibitions, museums, art festivals, and galleries around the world.<br/><br/>In 2010, they founded the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure at UC Santa Cruz to pursue strategies that mix art and science to respond creatively to global warming and climate change. The Center brings together artists and scientists to design ecosystem-adaptation projects in critical regions around the world in response to&#160;climate change. The <em>Future Garden</em> project was conceived before Helen&#8217;s death earlier this year.<br/><br/>&#8220;For nearly 50 years, the Harrisons' art works and proposals addressed the environment, ecology, and then global warming on a scale unique in contemporary art,&#8221;&#160;said Institute of the Arts and Sciences director John Weber. "Their vision posed challenges and solutions of a transformational nature, and to have one of their major pieces here on our campus is both a great gift and a challenge to our thinking and actions.&#8221;<br/><br/>"In the midst of fear, resignation, and the urge to give up and look away, the Harrisons have always sought to create hope and propose solutions to the ecological crises of our time. Their <em>Future Garden</em>&#160;here does both," he added.<br/>___________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><em>The opening reception for <strong>Future Garden</strong> will take place on May 19, from 4 to 6 p.m. at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and Botanic Garden.

Scientists have long understood the fundamental role of tRNAs in translating genetic code into proteins, but in recent years they have discovered new and unexpected functions for these molecules, including specialized regulatory roles in the cell sometimes carried out by small fragments of tRNAs.</p>
<p>"It's a whole new layer of regulation that no one expected. We're at the stage where people are just starting to realize that tRNA fragments are actually regulatory molecules and are interacting with a wide variety of things in the cell," said Todd Lowe, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest tRNAs and tRNA fragments are involved in cellular processes associated with diseases such as cancer, viral infections, and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<p>Lowe's lab is at the forefront of this burgeoning field. He and his collaborators developed a special RNA sequencing technique (ARM-seq) needed to detect and sequence tRNA fragments in the cells of humans and other organisms. Bioinformatics software Lowe developed as a graduate student to find and annotate tRNA genes in genome sequences is still widely used by researchers and genomics centers, including the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information and the European Bioinformatics Institute. His lab also maintains the rapidly growing Genomics tRNA Database used by researchers around the world, and he developed a new system for naming tRNA genes that has been adopted by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee and other databases.</p>
<p>The National Human Genome Research Institute has just awarded a five-year, $2.7 million grant to support Lowe's continued international leadership in the study of tRNA gene function. He has had NIH funding to study transfer RNA since 2012, and the new grant will fund ongoing efforts to characterize all 500 human tRNA genes and determine when and where (in which tissues and cell types) they are active. Lowe's research has already shown that these genes are tightly regulated&#8212;fewer than a third of them are turned on in all cells, while most are active only in stem cells or in certain tissues.</p>
<p>Lowe's comprehensive approach to characterizing tRNA genes will help researchers understand the full range of their roles in the cell, both as mature, full-length tRNAs and as tRNA fragments, which are derived from mature tRNAs as they are broken down and recycled by the cell. Researchers can use CRISPR genome editing technology to study the effects of knocking out specific tRNA genes, and Lowe plans to design the molecular tools (CRISPR guide RNAs for all human tRNA genes) needed to do this.</p>
<p>"We're just starting to understand all of the functions of transfer RNAs. This project will fill in a gaping hole in our understanding of human genes," Lowe said.</p>
<p>One reason there are so many tRNA genes, he said, is to enable cells to ramp up production of tRNA during periods of rapid growth. If tRNAs are essential to rapidly growing cells, such as cancer cells, they could be a potential target for novel drugs. But researchers will need much more information about the roles of different tRNAs to identify the best targets. "We've identified the tightly regulated ones that are only turned on in rapidly growing cells, and we're now studying those," Lowe said.</p>
<p>Transfer RNA may be the oldest type of RNA molecule in the cell, and its fundamental role in gene translation has not changed much as life evolved. Secondary functions have arisen in the course of evolution, however, and more complex organisms seem to have acquired more tRNA genes and more roles for tRNA fragments, Lowe said.</p>
<p>"Our understanding of how tRNA is used in the cell is changing rapidly, and now it's a matter of applying the technologies we have to systematically understand all the roles of these molecules and how we can potentially manipulate them or develop drugs to interact with them," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rna-sequencing.html</url><title>New method reveals hidden population of regulatory molecules in cells</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="73e51711807270175cb4ed6ba6e40f94"><name>financial-interests-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Proposed policy: Disclosure of Financial Interest in Private Sponsors of Research</title><summary>The Office of the President invites comments on a proposed new Presidential Policy on Disclosure of Financial Interests and Management of Conflicts of Interest in Private Sponsors of Research.</summary><start-date>1526626800000</start-date><display-name>Disclosure of Financial Interest in Private Sponsors of Research </display-name><path>/2018/05/financial-interests-policy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/financial-interests-policy</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1526657782419</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1526686706588</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Office of the President invites comments on a proposed new Presidential Policy on Disclosure of Financial Interests and Management of Conflicts of Interest in Private Sponsors of Research and proposed related revisions to APM - 028, Disclosure of Financial Interest in Private Sponsors of Research.</p>
<p>This new Policy provides the core parameters for continued compliance with the regulations issued by the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC). Effective July 22, 2015, the FPPC revised its regulations that affect the&#160;review&#160;of Statements of Economic Interests for Principal Investigators (also known as the Form 700-U). The University will continue its long-standing practice of performing a substantive review of Forms 700-U. However, this new Policy will provide the UC campuses, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources greater control over their local processes in reviewing the Forms 700-U. The proposed new Presidential Policy will govern continued compliance with FPPC regulations and review of Forms 700-U for all University employees, while revised APM - 028 will maintain additional important principles guiding the conduct of sponsored research for all academic appointees.</p>

That's the question Forest Peri is asking about handcrafted "bee hotels" he built and installed in six gardens around Santa Cruz County this spring.</p>
<p>Mindful that the population of European honeybees is crashing worldwide due to Colony Collapse Disorder, Peri wanted to make a welcoming home for native bees. Solitary bees, many of which are incredibly efficient pollinators native to Northern California, are his target audience.</p>
<p>"There are 20,000 species of bees around the world&#8212;over 4,000 in North America and more than 60 along the Central Coast of California&#8212;but most are very understudied," said Peri, a senior majoring in environmental studies. "Solitary bees have a lot of potential."</p>
<p>Solitary bees are commonly called mason bees for their use of mud or other "masonry" materials to construct their nests. They are known for their prodigious pollinating abilities: just 250-300 females can pollinate an acre of apples, equivalent to the work of 20,000 European honeybees.</p>
<p>Unlike honeybees, solitary bees nest individually in small crevices.</p>
<p>Rather than the familiar stackable wooden boxes filled with frames on which honeybees build wax cells to hold honey and raise young, solitary bees fill small cavities with a series of cells. Females fill the cavities from back to front, laying larvae and a pollen sac, then plugging it with more mud before starting the process again.</p>
<p>Peri handcrafted his "bee hotels" in the campus wood shop and welding studio. Borrowing a proven design, he drilled cavities into blocks of pine and Douglas fir, and welded metal roofs and other hardware. He hoped to determine the bees' preferred material, crevice size, and surroundings&#8212;knowledge that could be a boon to those helping bees locally and beyond.</p>
<p>Peri installed hotels in six locations: the Alan Chadwick Garden campus, the UCSC Farm, the Kresge College Garden, the Homeless Garden Project on Delaware Avenue, Trescony Garden near the intersection of Bay Avenue and Mission Street, and the Live Oak Grange on 17th Avenue.</p>
<p>And then he waited.</p>
<p>Ten weeks later, Peri reports that only two cavities of one hotel&#8212;at the Chadwick Garden&#8212;have been occupied. But given the vagaries of scientific research, he's not discouraged, particularly in light of his graduate student adviser's experience: it took Hamutahl Cohen <em>two years </em>for any bees to occupy the bee hotels she installed as part of her dissertation research.</p>
<p>"Most of my academic life, especially in science, has been about setting up experiments with known outcomes," he explained. "This is way more exciting."</p>
<p>This project tapped Peri's woodworking and welding skills, his knowledge of plant science, and his burgeoning interest in bees.</p>
<p>"I didn't even know what solitary bees were a year ago," said Peri, who designed the experiment as his senior project. "It's been a very large learning curve."</p>
<p>Peri is an engaged, committed student who brought good questions to the project, said Cohen. "Forest is genuinely curious and has an inquiring mind," she said. "It's been a pleasure to guide him through this project."</p>
<p>Peri laments the decline of the European honeybee, which he says is linked to modern, industrial-style agriculture. Honey-loving humans domesticated the honeybee about 10,000 years ago, and it has been an inexpensive and productive agricultural partner for humans ever since&#8212;until recently, when their numbers began plummeting. Today, there is an urgent need to shore up a diverse population of pollinators.</p>
<p>"Having a diversity of pollinators is good, because they're active at different times of the day and the year, their ranges are different, and they fly in different conditions," said Peri.</p>
<p>Peri has enjoyed the freedom of running his own research experiment.</p>
<p>"There are no limitations at all," he enthused. "There's no one looking over my shoulder. I go check the hotels when it's time to go check. When I go, I'm going for me. The amount of time I put into it determines the amount I'll get out of it."</p>
<p>And he has bounced back from disappointment about the paucity of bees inhabiting his hotels so far, appreciating the wide spectrum of other things he's learning about: pests and parasitic wasps, placement of the hotels, honing his observation skills, time management, and more.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to life after graduation this spring, Peri says he has a lot of hobbies he'd like to pursue, including art, mountain biking, and rock climbing. A native of Marin County, Peri had hoped to go to college in Colorado, which turned out to be unaffordable. "I'm so happy I came here," he said.</p>
<p>Peri has developed an enduring affection for the beauty and predictability of plants that might influence his next steps.</p>
<p>"Humans make very little sense to me," mused Peri. "It seems we can never agree. Even with animals and insects, I just don't always understand the behavior. But plants make sense. They grow toward light. They grow toward water. They're beautiful and interesting."</p>
<p>And they need bees. Pollination is vital to the plant life cycle, and Peri holds out hope that his hotels will yet contribute to a growing local bee population.</p>
<p>"I went into this thinking I might make a cool discovery, and maybe I still will," he said.</p>

<p>I encourage the campus community to plan ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>charge cell phones before the outages,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carry a flashlight,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do not perform experiments or other work that rely on consistent power, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work under the assumption that electrical power will be unavailable during the times noted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></p>
<p>Managers and supervisors have the responsibility for providing direction to employees, students, and volunteers, including operational decision-making. In the event of a power outage, they are responsible for employee safety and for the implementation of all related business continuity actions. Managers are asked to prepare and address any questions that individuals under their supervision may have. Please read this detailed information closely and work to ensure readiness.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Facilities information</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Emergency power &#8211; The standard emergency power supply for the campus, inclusive of emergency lighting, will be operable during the scheduled outage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lighting &#8211; Managers should ensure that there is adequate lighting to support a safe workplace.&#160; If a workplace does not have enough light to work, please reassign the employee workspace.&#160; It&#8217;s also best to ensure that employees and offices have flashlights on hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elevators and accessibility &#8211; Building coordinators, divisional facilities staff, building managers, or supervisors will need to post signage at all floors indicating they should not be used during the outage period. Please print the attached signage pdf and assign the posting to a specific person. Use of the elevators during this time could result in entrapment within the elevators requiring a fire department response. Anyone needing an elevator to access their place of work or general campus activity should consult with their supervisor for alternative accessibility options and work locations for the time of the outage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dining&#8212;Cowell/Stevenson Dining Hall will be closed during the outage.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>MyUCSC &#8211; although applications housed in the campus Data Center will remain fully functional during the outage, individuals working on campus should be prepared for building network outages which could disrupt connections to campus systems. Faculty especially should take precautions if entering grades via MyUCSC from their office or any campus building during the outage period, as a sudden network outage could result in lost work. Precautions include saving often, working from a non-campus location, or refraining from entering grades (or performing other critical systems-related work) during the outage window.</p>

<p>A central aim of the strategic academic planning process is the development of a small number of academic priority areas in which campus will invest additional resources over the next five years. We recently completed collecting campus feedback on 28 Themed Academic Working Group proposals, which were submitted in the hopes of being designated as priority areas. All told, 117 faculty, 118 students (70 undergraduates and 48 graduates), and 53 staff submitted assessments. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M2Ytwng3mwAFRaKOWbqD9Btx7tdieexC/view">Summaries of the campus survey results are available online</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we remain committed to our identity as a comprehensive university in the liberal arts tradition with a wide range of thriving programs. Moreover, the conversation between us all won&#8217;t end with this year or this process. A healthy academic community continues to look for ways to support its best and most promising programs. Our dialogue will sustain long beyond this single process.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y89-3uAyfhdNCw5Y623vAz5jL3fMkPBtQYAihlGrpfI">proposals</a> are also under review by the Academic Senate, Library and ITS. The Senate will provide feedback on the research and teaching opportunities that the proposals offer, while the Library and ITS will help us better understand the resource needs of the proposals. In addition, the Academic Advisory Committee, the main Strategic Academic Plan committee charged with assessing academic content, is currently completing its proposal review. The committee will soon prepare a list of the strengths and weaknesses of the top six to eight submissions for consideration by the chancellor and me.</p>
<h2>Barrier removal</h2>
<p>Over the course of this academic year, we have solicited input on the institutional barriers that impede our capacity to do our best research and teaching. Faculty, students, and staff have responded with hundreds of examples&#8212;everything from the structural challenges that prevent team teaching to the lack of funding in support of graduate students to the inefficient assignment of laboratory and classroom space. The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WxRy_X9CX8D9E0iDWxQho-zpDkMbN7O-/view?usp=sharing">50 most frequently mentioned barriers</a> are currently undergoing prioritization by the Academic Senate. The Senate list will be sent to the Academic Advisory Committee for review and, ultimately, to the chancellor and me. Barriers that exist in more confined spaces&#8212;a single department, for example&#8212;will be shared with the deans.</p>
<p>In March, the chancellor and I formed and charged a working group with developing strategies and step-by-step guides for the reduction or elimination of the barriers we deem most critical to address. It&#8217;s our hope that the work on barrier elimination will improve the day-to-day lives of virtually everyone on campus.</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>The UC system, our leadership, and our students continue to lobby legislative leaders in Sacramento for adequate funding of higher education, and this year there are some encouraging signs we may receive a larger annual allocation from the state, given that tax receipts have exceeded estimates. While this is good news, we have not returned to the funding levels enjoyed by the UC system in decades past&#8212;particularly to a time when state funding supported the whole spectrum of student and faculty needs, from classrooms to labs to housing.</p>
<p>State funding also has been inadequate to meet the changing needs of our students and our evolving pedagogies. To continue to address the needs of our students and faculty, we can look for partners that share our values and support our unique character. Take, for example, the generous donors who endowed Rachel Carson College (formerly College Eight) or consider this same college&#8217;s mission to &#8220;(seek) out and (build) partnerships with green innovators and entrepreneurs in Santa Cruz, the Monterey Bay region and Silicon Valley.&#8221; They note that they are &#8220;open to new ideas, co-curricular partners, and volunteers.&#8221; These are strategies that have helped the college and its students to thrive and to advance our commitment to environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>The SAP seeks to find similar ways to fund and support our mission. We are committed to our community&#8217;s goals of raising resources in ways that keep with our values. Possible strategies may include seeking funding from like-minded philanthropic bodies, forging partnerships with organizations that advance ideals we value, creating self-sustaining programs, consulting with NGOs, or aiding faculty in winning external grants. We have asked the Senate to brainstorm ways of generating resources and remain open to community suggestions as well. If you have ideas, feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:academicplan@ucsc.edu">academicplan@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<h2>Undergraduate survey</h2>
<p>We have developed a survey for undergraduate students to better understand how we can serve their academic needs. Our Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies unit, based on feedback received from our one-on-one interviews, in forums and focus groups, and from students groups, developed the survey. The survey launched this week and will close June 5. We hope that students will take the time to provide us with critical feedback and that faculty will encourage their students to do so. All undergraduates were sent individual links to the survey on May 15.</p>
<h2>Open forums</h2>
<p>Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqREyLX6JMD3GPISz64R4EQhD6_Hyzs4D2RM9JRdb1tPq-RQ/viewform">register</a> by noon Monday, May 21, to attend one of the open forums on strategic academic planning, either 9:30&#8211;11:30 a.m. Wednesday, May 23, or 4&#8211;6 p.m. Thursday, May 24. At the forums, we will provide updates on the work accomplished to date, explain next steps, and take your questions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="835dde34807270175cb4ed6b7988f1b7"><name>hurricane-antimatter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lightning in the eyewall of a hurricane beamed antimatter toward the ground</title><summary>The first detection of a downward positron beam from a terrestrial gamma-ray flash was captured by an instrument flown through the eyewall of Hurricane Patricia in 2015.</summary><keywords>David Smith, SCIPP, TGFs, terrestrial gamma ray flash</keywords><start-date>1526886000000</start-date><display-name>Lightning in the eyewall of a hurricane beamed antimatter toward the ground</display-name><path>/2018/05/hurricane-antimatter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/hurricane-antimatter</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1526917356065</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1527295919463</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/patricia-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/patricia-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>patricia-410.jpg</name><display-name>patricia-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>138847</file-size><width>410</width><height>535</height></image><image-alt>Hurricane Patricia satellite image</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/patricia-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/patricia-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>patricia-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>patricia-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13648</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Hurricane Patricia satellite image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Hurricane Patricia was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere as it approached the west coast of Mexico in 2015.

Amid the extreme violence of the storm, scientists observed something new: a downward beam of positrons, the antimatter counterpart of electrons, creating a burst of powerful gamma-rays and x-rays.</p>
<p>Detected by an instrument aboard NOAA's Hurricane Hunter aircraft, which flew through the eyewall of the storm at its peak intensity, the positron beam was not a surprise to the UC Santa Cruz scientists who built the instrument. But it was the first time anyone has observed this phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to David Smith, a professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, the positron beam was the downward component of an upward terrestrial gamma-ray flash that sent a short blast of radiation into space above the storm. Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) were first seen in 1994 by space-based gamma-ray detectors. They occur in conjunction with lightning and have now been observed thousands of times by orbiting satellites. A reverse positron beam was predicted by theoretical models of TGFs, but had never been detected.</p>
<p>"This is the first confirmation of that theoretical prediction, and it shows that TGFs are piercing the atmosphere from top to bottom with high-energy radiation," Smith said. "This event could have been detected from space, like almost all the other reported TGFs, as an upward beam caused by an avalanche of electrons. We saw it from below because of a beam of antimatter (positrons) sent in the opposite direction."</p>
<p>One unexpected implication of the study, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2017JD027771">published May 17 in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres</em></a>, is that many TGFs could be detected via the reverse positron beam using ground-based instruments at high altitudes. It's not necessary to fly into the eye of a hurricane.</p>
<p>"We detected it at an altitude of 2.5 kilometers, and I estimated our detectors could have seen it down to 1.5 kilometers. That's the altitude of Denver, so there are a lot of places where you could in theory see them if you had an instrument in the right place at the right time during a thunderstorm," Smith said.</p>
<p><strong>Unresolved questions</strong></p>
<p>Despite the confirmation of the reverse positron beam, many questions remain unresolved about the mechanisms that drive TGFs. Strong electric fields in thunderstorms can accelerate electrons to near the speed of light, and these "relativistic" electrons emit gamma-rays when they scatter off of atoms in the atmosphere. The electrons can also knock other electrons off of atoms and accelerate them to high energies, creating an avalanche of relativistic electrons. A TGF, which is an extremely bright flash of gamma-rays, requires a large number of avalanches of relativistic electrons.</p>
<p>"It's an extraordinary event, and we still don't understand how it gets so bright," Smith said.</p>
<p>The source of the positrons, however, is a well known phenomenon in physics called pair production, in which a gamma ray interacts with the nucleus of an atom to create an electron and a positron. Since they have opposite charges, they are accelerated in opposite directions by the electric field of the thunderstorm. The downward moving positrons produce x-rays and gamma-rays in their direction of travel when they collide with atomic nuclei, just like the upward moving electrons.</p>
<p>"What we saw in the aircraft are the gamma-rays produced by the downward positron beam," Smith said.</p>
<p>First author Gregory Bowers, now at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and coauthor Nicole Kelley, now at Swift Navigation, were both graduate students at UC Santa Cruz when they worked together on the instrument that made the detection. The Airborne Detector for Energetic Lightning Emissions (ADELE) mark II was designed to observe TGFs up close by measuring x-rays and gamma-rays from aircraft flown into or above thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Getting too close to a TGF could be hazardous, although the risk drops off rapidly with distance from the source. The gamma-ray dose at a distance of one kilometer would be negligible, Smith said. "It's hypothetically a risk, but the odds are quite small," he said. "I don't ask pilots to fly into thunderstorms, but if they're going anyway I'll put an instrument on board."</p>
<p>Smith's group was the first to detect a TGF from an airplane using an earlier instrument, the ADELE mark I. In that case, the upward beam from the TGF was detected above a thunderstorm. For this study, the ADELE mark II flew aboard NOAA's Hurricane Hunter WP-3D Orion during the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>
<p>In addition to Bowers, Smith, and Kelley, the coauthors of the paper include Forest Martinez-McKinney at UC Santa Cruz, Joseph Dwyer at the University of New Hampshire, Steve Cummer at Duke University, Stan Heckman at Earth Networks, Robert Holzworth at University of Washington, Paul Reasor, Todd Richards, Jason Dunion, and Frank Marks at NOAA, and Hamid Rassoul at Florida Institute of Technology.

<p>Pettigrew, an internationally renowned expert on racism and intergroup relations, is receiving the 2018 Scientific Impact Award, an honor shared with UCSC alumna Linda Tropp (Ph.D., '00, psychology), professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and a former graduate student of Pettigrew's.</p>
<p>The award recognizes past articles about psychology that have proven "highly influential." The winning paper, "<a href="http://www.iaccp.org/sites/default/files/pettigrew_tropp_2006_contact_theory_0.pdf">A Meta-Analytic Test of Intergroup Contact Theory</a>," has now been cited more than 5,300 times; it appeared in 2006. In it, Pettigrew and Tropp analyzed 515 studies and found that intergroup contact tends to reduce many types of prejudice. The award will be presented in October in Portland, Oregon, at the society's annual conference.</p>

<p>Arden&#8217;s project, &#8220;Building secure decentralized applications with trusted hardware and blockchains,&#8221; will explore a language-based approach to building inherently secure decentralized applications.</p>
<p>The CAREER award provides $510,000 over five years. During this time, Arden plans to create a platform for new systems and new research that he and other investigators can use to promote security in an increasingly decentralized environment.</p>
<p>In a decentralized system, there is no single entity that everyone trusts to make decisions on behalf of all parties. Collaborating across such systems is challenging. If the collaborating parties don&#8217;t inherently trust one another, and there is no central entity that enforces the rules, then how do parties safely execute transactions? How do they collaborate on projects and computations? How can they safely communicate and exchange things like money and information?</p>
<p>New tools and approaches such as trusted hardware and blockchain mechanisms provide some level of security, but they aren&#8217;t perfect.</p>
<p>&#8220;These new mechanisms are promising, but neither can protect all three pillars of information security by themselves,&#8221; Arden said. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are considered the three pillars of information security management.</p>
<p>Arden&#8217;s proposal addresses how to integrate mechanisms like trusted hardware and blockchains with a secure programming language to build inherently secure applications. These applications are secure by construction because the security relies on the semantics of the language and not on the skills of application developers. All valid programs written in such a language are secure by design.</p>
<p>Specifically, Arden will continue his previous work on FLAME, a programming language that offers more precise abstractions for expressing security intent in decentralized systems. This gives developers assurance that their programs are both secure and realizable without requiring them to design and implement complex security protocols. Arden will also develop DECENT, a decentralized runtime platform for executing decentralized applications, backed by trusted hardware and blockchain mechanisms to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>
<p>The CAREER awards are the NSF&#8217;s most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research.</p>
<p>Arden has made key contributions to language-based approaches to security. He received his Ph.D. in 2017 from Cornell University and joined the faculty of the Baskin School of Engineering in fall 2017.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="848dc5ba807270175cb4ed6b7cfb747c"><name>mandel-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astrophysicist Jedidah Isler will give annual Mandel Lecture on June 7</title><summary>Award-winning astrophysicist Jedidah Isler will give a free public lecture entitled "Blazars: Nature's particle accelerators" on Thursday, June 7, at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>Mandel Lecture</keywords><start-date>1526972400000</start-date><display-name>Astrophysicist Jedidah Isler will give annual Mandel Lecture on June 7</display-name><path>/2018/05/mandel-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/mandel-lecture</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1526937272557</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1527002781130</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/jedidah-isler-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/jedidah-isler-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jedidah-isler-400.jpg</name><display-name>jedidah-isler-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>57421</file-size><width>400</width><height>264</height></image><image-alt>Jedidah Isler</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/jedidah-isler-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/jedidah-isler-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jedidah-isler-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jedidah-isler-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17236</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jedidah Isler</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jedidah Isler</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Award-winning astrophysicist Jedidah Isler will give a free public lecture entitled "Blazars: Nature's particle accelerators" on Thursday, June 7, at 7:30 p.m. at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Blazars are supermassive, hyperactive black holes found at the cores of large galaxies, feeding on gas, dust, and space debris. Each blazar's insatiable diet generates a spectacular firework-like cocktail of shooting light beams and jets of charged particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Isler's research on blazars focuses on understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for the highest energy radiation emitted by blazar particle jets.</p>
<p>Isler is an award-winning astrophysicist, TED Fellow, National Geographic Explorer, and nationally recognized speaker and advocate for inclusive STEM education. Born in Virginia Beach, Virginia, she received a master's degree in physics from Fisk-Vanderbilt and became the first African-American woman to receive a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Yale University. Isler is currently a National Science Foundation Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellow at Vanderbilt University.</p>

<p>The annual event is free and open to the public, offering visitors an opportunity to play innovative new games, meet the student creators, and attend presentations on the latest game-related research. The Sammy Showcase takes place on Saturday, June 9, from 1 to 6 p.m. at the UCSC Silicon Valley Campus (located at 3175 Bowers Avenue in Santa Clara). There will also be a live stream of the event on Twitch (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ucscgpm">twitch.tv/ucscgpm</a>).</p>
<p>More than 50 games will be presented by students in the full range of game design programs at UC Santa Cruz, in both the Baskin School of Engineering and the Arts Division. UCSC student games have won many awards, and both the undergraduate and graduate programs are <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/03/game-design.html"><span>ranked among the top in the nation</span></a> by the Princeton Review.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is also the <a href="http://www.kmjn.org/game-rankings/"><span>top-ranked institution in a recent survey</span></a> of institutions involved in technical games research. UCSC faculty and graduate students are at the forefront of innovations in areas such as the use of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and wearable technology in games. Graduate students will be giving talks on these and other topics at the Sammy Showcase; talks will be streamed on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/playableUCSC">YouTube.com/playableUCSC</a>).</p>
<p>The student games will be evaluated by a panel of industry experts, and awards will be given based on design, technical, and artistic achievement.</p>
<p>UCSC offers a broad range of programs in computer game design. The Baskin School of Engineering established the first undergraduate major in computer game design in the UC system in 2006. In addition to B.S. and B.A. degrees in game design, the campus also has three graduate programs with an emphasis on games: the professional M.S. in games and playable media; the Ph.D. or M.S. in computational media; and the M.F.A. in digital arts and new media in the Arts Division.</p>

<p>"It is essential to understand these processes because we don't get new neurons in the central nervous system, and even if we learn how to introduce new neurons, we still need them to integrate in the correct way. Here we show there is a mechanism in adult mammals to ensure the correct connections are made," said Alexander Sher, associate professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of the new study, <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30535-9">published May 24 in <em>Current Biology</em></a>.</p>
<p>Vision loss from diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa results from degeneration of the light-sensing photoreceptors in the retina. Medical researchers have begun to explore potential therapeutic strategies to replace the lost photoreceptors. This approach could only work, however, if the new photoreceptors could be connected properly to the neural circuitry in the retina.</p>
<p>"Our findings provide some hope that if new photoreceptors can be introduced and survive, the correct connections could be reestablished," Sher said.</p>
<p>Sher and his colleagues took advantage of a unique pattern of connectivity in the retinas of ground squirrels, which makes it easy to track changes. Like most mammals, ground squirrels have two types of photoreceptors for color vision: S-cone photoreceptors sensitive to short-wavelength light and M-cones sensitive to medium-wavelength light. The neurons that connect to the photoreceptors and transmit signals from them are called bipolar cells. In ground squirrels, each S-cone bipolar cell connects to only one S-cone photoreceptor and vice versa, resulting in a one-to-one connection between S-cones and S-cone bipolar cells.</p>
<p>"It's a nice trackable circuit, and people have developed antibodies we can use to label both S-cone photoreceptors and S-cone bipolar cells in the retina and see what happens if there is an injury that leaves bipolar cells with no input from a synaptic partner," Sher said.</p>
<p>The researchers found that bipolar cells left without a connection to a photoreceptor start to grow new branches, called dendrites. As the new dendrites of S-cone bipolar cells randomly explore the retinal layer where synapses are made, they bypass any M-cones they encounter and only form new synapses with S-cones.</p>
<p>"This tells us that selective connectivity can be reestablished in an adult mammal, which had not been shown before," Sher said. "How this might translate into other parts of the brain, we don't know. But for the retina, it shows we might be able to make new connections after photoreceptors are lost."</p>
<p>Sher noted that ground squirrels might have an advantage over humans in this respect, because changes are known to occur in their photoreceptor synapses while they are hibernating. It's possible that the molecular mechanisms available to ground squirrels might not be available in the human retina, he said.</p>
<p>"There are still a lot of unknowns, but the more we learn about these processes the better off we are," Sher said.</p>
<p>In addition to Sher, the authors of the study include first author Corinne Beier at UC Santa Cruz (currently at the National Institute of Mental Health) and coauthor Daniel Palanker at Stanford University. This work was supported by the Burroughs Welcome Fund, Pew Charitable Trusts, and National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="88b87856807270175cb4ed6b89de7cb3"><name>beth-shapiro-hhmi</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Biologist Beth Shapiro selected as Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator</title><summary>Shapiro’s Paleogenomics Lab at UC Santa Cruz uses ancient DNA to study evolutionary history and the effects of environmental change on species and ecosystems.</summary><keywords>Beth Shapiro, HHMI Investigator</keywords><start-date>1527084000000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Beth Shapiro selected as Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator</display-name><path>/2018/05/beth-shapiro-hhmi</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/beth-shapiro-hhmi</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1527007179767</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1528220087255</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/beth-shapiro-portrait-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/beth-shapiro-portrait-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beth-shapiro-portrait-400.jpg</name><display-name>beth-shapiro-portrait-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>88275</file-size><width>400</width><height>480</height></image><image-alt>Beth Shapiro</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/beth-shapiro-portrait-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/beth-shapiro-portrait-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beth-shapiro-portrait-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>beth-shapiro-portrait-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17605</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Beth Shapiro</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Beth Shapiro (photo by Peter Barreras)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Shapiro’s Paleogenomics Lab at UC Santa Cruz uses ancient DNA to study evolutionary history and the effects of environmental change on species and ecosystems</article-subhead><article-text><p>Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, is among 19 top scientists selected by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) to become HHMI investigators and receive the support needed to move their research in creative new directions.</p>
<p>The HHMI Investigator Program provides flexible, long-term support for more than 300 investigators and members of their research teams. HHMI investigators are widely recognized for their creativity and research accomplishments. David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, has been a HHMI investigator since 2000.</p>
<p>Shapiro is a leader in the field of ancient DNA, using genetic material recovered from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago to study evolution and explore how species and ecosystems have changed over time. She isolated the oldest DNA yet recovered&#8212;from a 700,000-year-old horse bone&#8212;as well as the oldest viral DNA and RNA, and she was the first to apply ancient DNA in population genetics. Much of her work over the past 15 years has focused on the large mammals that lived in the Arctic long before humans colonized North America, including woolly mammoths, ancient horses, bears, and bison. This research can provide valuable insights into how species and ecosystems responded to rapid global warming at the end of the last ice age.</p>
<p>"We can see what happened as the climate changed, how species and populations and ecosystems changed," Shapiro said. "These findings can inform our decisions about how to use limited resources to preserve and protect species and ecosystems in the face of current climate change."</p>
<p><strong>Paleogenomics Lab</strong></p>
<p>Shapiro&#8217;s Paleogenomics Lab at UC Santa Cruz has been at the forefront of ancient DNA research and continues to develop new and more efficient methods to recover and analyze trace amounts of DNA left behind by ancient organisms.</p>
<p>"In the early days, it was all big mammals with big bones that were frozen in the Arctic. With improvements in technology, we can now start getting DNA from smaller animals, from plants, and from temperate regions," Shapiro said. "Improving efficiency is the big thing. If we can get DNA from more poorly preserved remains, then we can expand the temporal range, the geographic range, and the species range of our studies."</p>
<p>Advances in the recovery of DNA from environmental samples such as ancient sediments offer exciting new opportunities to catalog past biodiversity and study how communities of organisms evolve over time. &#8220;We can take sediment cores from lakes or frozen soil and ask who was present when and where, and how that changed over time. These data will provide the first true insights into how ecosystems evolve over geologic time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The author of an award-winning book, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/04/shapiro-book.html"><em>How to Clone a Mammoth</em></a>, Shapiro has been a leading voice in discussions of the use of genetic engineering tools for biodiversity conservation and, potentially, for the resurrection of extinct species. She was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2009 and a Packard Fellow and National Geographic Emerging Explorer in 2010, among other awards and honors. In 2017, she won support from the HHMI Professors Program for innovations in science education.</p>
<p>Each of the new investigators will receive roughly $8 million over a seven-year term, which is renewable pending a scientific review. In addition, investigator support includes a guaranteed two-year transition period. This new group of investigators is the first to be appointed to a seven-year term (previous terms lasted five years).&#160;They include UC Santa Cruz alumna <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/2018-investigators/gia-voeltz">Gia Voeltz</a> (B.S. in biochemistry, 1994), who worked in the molecular biology lab of Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, as an undergraduate. HHMI selected the new investigators from a pool of 675 eligible applicants.</p>
<p>"Every scientist is unique, but they all need one thing: time," said HHMI President Erin O'Shea. "HHMI is dedicated to providing outstanding biomedical scientists with the time and resources to do their best work. We think of this as investing in people, not just projects."</p>

This new policy follows a familiar risk management paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk Assessment</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Participation</li>
</ul>
<p>Field research can present unique safety challenges when conducted in remote or potentially hazardous environments. The purpose of the Field Research Safety policy is to address the need to manage field research safety risk. The safety risk assessment process includes identifying hazards, evaluating exposure potential, and implementing appropriate mitigating measures. Principal Investigators, academic supervisors, field team leaders, and other responsible individuals must control safety risks associated with both the research and the local environment.</p>
<p>EH&amp;S has created a variety of tools to help researchers address the aims of the policy. A field safety plan template for remote field work, UC travel resources (UC Away and iJET), and details regarding the satellite communication device loaner program can be found on the EH&amp;S Field Research <a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/research-safety/field-research/index.html">website</a>.</p>
<p>I encourage all members of the research community to familiarize yourself with the policy and ensure that the campus field research programs are managed within the best practices for this work.</p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz is known for its beautiful landscapes, but its meadows, forests, farm fields, and coastal bluffs also support a range of scientific research and hands-on learning opportunities for students.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Davis, who graduated from Merrill College in March, took advantage of everything the campus has to offer as a "living laboratory," getting a range of hands-on experiences that complemented the rigorous "book learning" of her ecology and evolutionary biology major. Learning in the outdoor classrooms of UC Santa Cruz helped Davis build an impressive network of faculty and staff mentors, and it gave her the skills to land a job managing a large research project on the campus right after graduation.</p>
<p>"I learned so much from working with faculty, staff, and graduate students in non-classroom settings," said Davis.</p>
<p>Students in virtually every discipline from the arts to engineering take advantage of the campus's physical resources to support their educational experience. In Davis's case, to say she "did it all" wouldn't be much of an overstatement. She participated in field research at the UCSC Farm, documenting disease transfer among plants; she practiced restoration ecology on the UC Natural Reserve at Younger Lagoon, where she planted native plants and restored coastal bluffs; she learned plant propagation and nurtured seedlings in the UCSC Greenhouses and traced the path of pathogens after her wards were set out on a sprawling campus meadow; and she donned head-to-toe coveralls, gloves, and eye protection to tromp through poison oak-covered hillsides of the Campus Natural Reserve as part of an ongoing forest-inventory project.</p>
<p>Davis picked up countless valuable skills, from mammal trapping and bird surveys to trail work. By the time she enrolled in an upper-division botany class, she already knew a lot of local plants.</p>
<p>"I would've learned so much less without these experiences," said Davis. "It became core to my college experience. I felt like what I was learning in school complemented what I was learning in the field."</p>
<p><strong>Research that matters</strong></p>
<p>Campus lands support a range of federally funded research, and UC Santa Cruz undergraduates often play significant roles at every stage of a project. Davis knew she wanted to study ecology, and she chose Santa Cruz in part for the research opportunities and internships available to students.</p>
<p>"When I was looking for a college, I thought there was no way I'd find a place with everything I want," she said. "My mom encouraged me to look at UC Santa Cruz. My uncle went here. When I got in, I came and looked, and it had everything I was looking for in a college. With the ocean, forest, and meadows, there was so much for me to learn in the field I wanted to go into."</p>
<p>To Greg Gilbert, a professor of environmental studies who utilizes campus lands and greenhouse facilities for interdisciplinary research on plant disease, the campus really is a living laboratory.</p>
<p>"It's so much more than just a beautiful place," he said. "It's home to cutting-edge research, experiential learning, and so many cross-divisional projects. The campus hosts millions of dollars of government-funded research outside of the laboratories and buildings we usually think of as where research happens."</p>
<p><strong>Down on the Farm</strong></p>
<p>The 30-acre UC Santa Cruz Farm is the hub of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). It is one of the most familiar and visible sites of research, including an NSF-funded investigation co-led by Gilbert and Ingrid Parker, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. They are investigating how disease spreads among species of cover crops that are used to enhance soil fertility in organic agricultural systems, and they rely heavily on undergraduate collaborators.</p>
<p>"We want to know what is the most effective way to use cover crops without spreading more disease," explained Davis, who helped plant different types of grasses, legumes, and mustards that are used as cover crops. She and her teammates plotted out the research site, monitored plant growth, harvested the crops, and then headed to the lab where they documented the presence and extent of disease, extracted the DNA of pathogenic fungi, and weighed the dry biomass of the plants. "I was part of all the steps," said Davis.</p>
<p><strong>From greenhouse to meadow</strong></p>
<p>Davis played a key role in another offshoot of that study that is looking at the potential for disease to spread in campus meadows between plant species that are introduced from distant places to native plants&#8212;movement that can have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Davis helped track "pathogen spillover" among plants, mostly grasses and legumes. Started in campus greenhouses, the plants were relocated to the meadow in pots, where researchers are monitoring the diseases they catch from their relatives. "We want to know what pathogens are in the meadow and how related, non-native plants respond," she said.</p>
<p>These projects are part of a major interdisciplinary undertaking begun several years ago by Gilbert and Parker. Understanding how disease moves among species has implications for biodiversity, disease-control strategies, and commercial undertakings.</p>
<p>"Sudden Oak Death is decimating California's coastal oaks," said Gilbert. "That disease was brought to California through the nursery trade when they imported infected rhododendrons from Europe. That's why these studies matter. If the USDA approves a plant for import, and it unexpectedly brings in a hitchhiking pathogen, can we predict what kind of impacts that might have on local plant communities? These studies help us get those answers."</p>
<p><strong>Restoring Younger Lagoon Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Virtually every nook and cranny of campus has seen research and/or hands-on learning action. One of the most heavily utilized spaces is on the northern edge of Monterey Bay, just a few miles from the main campus. After being commercially farmed for decades, Younger Lagoon Reserve is now a protected area that spans beach, wetlands, grasslands, and coastal scrub. For years, student interns have tended the lands to restore the landscape and protect birds, mammals, and other residents.</p>
<p>Davis, like legions of students before her, enjoyed the physical work of weeding, transplanting seedlings, and collecting seeds.</p>
<p>"It's very hands on, and I felt like I was really making a difference for the local environment," said Davis, who spent three quarters interning and volunteering before spending a year as a student employee.</p>
<p>"I learned a lot," she said. "The reserve managers really try to build your skills: small mammal trapping, bird surveys, trail work, non-native plant management, planting native plant species. There was a lot to learn. That's why I stuck around."</p>
<p>"We're trying to mimic what's happening in nature," she added, rattling off an impressive list of native plants that are thriving on the reserve: coffeeberry, bee plant, sage, lizard tail, yarrow, California aster, blue-eyed grass, gumweed, juncus. "Restoration can be really effective."&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Forest Inventory</strong></p>
<p>In addition to Younger Lagoon, UC Santa Cruz oversees natural reserves at A&#241;o Nuevo, Big Creek, Fort Ord, and on upper campus, where about 400 acres has been set aside as the Campus Natural Reserve. An additional 1,000 acres of the main campus have been designated resource or protected lands, greatly expanding the number of sites available for research projects and ecological monitoring.</p>
<p>Not many people get to hike off trails with permission. But that's what Davis did as an intern working on the Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) on upper campus. This year-round monitoring project sends crews of interns into the Campus Natural Reserve to survey plants, tag and record woody species, examine duff and fallen leaves, calculate heights of trees, and plot plant locations.</p>
<p>In addition to the CFI, about 40 undergraduates are currently engaged with the 40-acre <a href="https://ferp.ucsc.edu/">Forest Ecology Research Plot</a> (FERP), located on the Campus Natural Reserve. Since 2007, student interns and assistants have documented the health of the forest and conducted research on the site, which is now part of the&#160;<a href="https://forestgeo.si.edu/">Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute Forest Global Earth Observatory Network</a>.</p>
<p>"The Smithsonian collaboration upped the stakes, because our data are now part of a global monitoring effort," said Gilbert. "We follow their standardized protocols. It speaks to another aspect of the value of these campus spaces."</p>
<p>The FERP site, which Gilbert established in 2007, is also part of the $800,000 NSF grant he and Parker received to study pathogens on the Farm and the Great Meadow. "The grant was only possible because UC Santa Cruz has the combined resources of the greenhouses, the Farm, the Campus Natural Reserve, and other protected natural lands," he said. "All of them play key, complementary roles that make the work possible."&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Faculty-led research and student learning go hand in hand on campus, where thousands of students have benefited from the campus natural reserves. More than 75 courses utilize the reserves every year, and more than 150 students become interns each year.</p>
<p>As the administrative director of <a href="https://naturalreserves.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves</a>, Gage Dayton keeps tabs on what students get out of their experiences on the designated lands. "They tell me it's invaluable," said Dayton. "And we know it influences their futures."</p>
<p>One survey of UC Santa Cruz graduates who participated in field study revealed that more than 65 percent said the experience dramatically impacted their career choices. Another survey found that graduates of field courses who'd found work in a relevant scientific field were more likely to have a job in their discipline than those who hadn't&#8212;suggesting that field courses and internships provide valuable skills and experiences that help students obtain careers in their field of study. Surveys also indicate that students who participated in these activities were more likely to go to graduate school, according to Dayton.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Living and learning </strong></p>
<p>Davis arrived on campus knowing she wanted to study ecology and pursue internships and research opportunities ("I had a really good AP biology teacher in high school in Orange County," she said). One benefit she didn't anticipate was the living-and-learning opportunity she had as a sophomore, when she joined UCSC's Program in Community and Agroecology (PICA), a residential program in the Lower Quarry near the Farm.</p>
<p>Davis began as a volunteer coordinator of the community garden, a focal point of this unique program where 36 undergraduates grow their own fruits and vegetables, cook collectively, and share meals several times a week. After one quarter, Davis moved into a paid position that she kept through the school year and summer. Organizing work days, plantings, and harvests was a good fit for an energetic, outgoing self-starter.</p>
<p>It came naturally for Davis to reach out in search of internships and enriching extracurricular opportunities, but she recognizes that other students find it difficult to "put themselves out there." Her advice is to monitor departmental websites, look for announcements, and consider teaching assistants as an entry point for getting to know graduate students&#8212;who often hold the key to research opportunities, because they need help.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Seeking the rigorous academic path</strong></p>
<p>Never one to shy away from rigor, Davis enrolled in a demanding new systemwide class last spring. Based on a course that was first taught at UC Santa Cruz and is now administered by the campus, "California Ecology and Conservation" uses UC's systemwide natural reserves as the classroom for seven weeks. Davis was one of 27 students from across the UC system who traveled around the state and engaged in weekly independent research projects.</p>
<p>"You have to form your question, strategize how to get the answer, collect data, analyze your findings, write, and present," she recalled. The workload was demanding&#8212;but rewarding.</p>
<p>Davis also opted to write a thesis, which isn't required for her major. "It's an extra step," she said. "It's good for graduate school, and it felt really important to me. I didn't want to miss out on any aspect of learning." Davis recently won a 2018 Dean's Undergraduate Award for outstanding achievements in her major and for her thesis. The dean's awards recognize high-caliber undergraduate research that is often both groundbreaking and interdisciplinary.</p>
<p>Davis wrote her thesis about research she conducted in campus greenhouses, where she studied plant-soil feedbacks in Scotch broom, an invasive flowering shrub. Not coincidentally, Davis's path to that project started at Younger Lagoon, where she met a lab technician working in Ingrid Parker's lab. That connection ultimately led to Davis landing the opportunity to participate in the Scotch broom study under Parker's supervision.</p>
<p>Along with everything else she has learned, Davis has learned to interact with professors and graduate researchers as colleagues and collaborators.</p>
<p>"When you get to know them outside the classroom, they look out for you," she said. "They'd come to me and say, 'Hey, would you be interested in this opportunity?' They're invested in you and want you to do well. I feel like I have a really huge network here."</p>
<p>As a freshly minted college graduate, Davis is landing on her feet with a five-month, full-time appointment as a lab tech in Parker and Gilbert's lab. They could not be more delighted to have her join them as a professional colleague.</p>
<p>"Elizabeth, more than anyone else, is making everything run&#8212;the Farm project, the meadow work, the lab. She's on top of it all," said Parker. "She is the quintessential UC Santa Cruz student."</p>

A new study led by theoretical astrophysicists at the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute and UC Santa Cruz provides a unified model that explains recent observations of these extreme events.</p>
<p>The breakthrough study, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aab429/meta">published in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em></a>, provides a new theoretical perspective for a fast-growing research field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only in the last decade or so have we been able to distinguish TDEs from other galactic phenomena, and the new model will provide us with the basic framework for understanding these rare events,&#8221; said coauthor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and Niels Bohr Professor at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>In most galaxies, the central black hole is quiescent, not actively consuming any material and therefore not emitting any light. Tidal disruption events are rare, only happening about once every 10,000 years in a typical galaxy. When an unlucky star gets torn apart, however, the black hole is "overfed" with stellar debris for a while and emits intense radiation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is interesting to see how materials get their way into the black hole under such extreme conditions,&#8221; said first author Jane Lixin Dai, assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen, who led the study. &#8220;As the black hole is eating the stellar gas, a vast amount of radiation is emitted. The radiation is what we can observe, and using it we can understand the physics and calculate the black hole properties. This makes it extremely interesting to go hunting for tidal disruption events.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the same physics is expected to happen in all tidal disruption events, about two dozen of which have been observed so far, the observed properties of these events have shown great variation. Some emit mostly x-rays, while others emit mostly visible and ultraviolet light. Theorists have been struggling to understand this diversity and assemble different pieces of the puzzle into a coherent model.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing angle</strong></p>
<p>In the new model, it is the viewing angle of the observer that accounts for differences in the observations. Galaxies are oriented randomly with respect to the line of sight of observers on Earth, who see different aspects of a tidal disruption event depending on its orientation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is like there is a veil that covers part of a beast,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz explained. &#8220;From some angles we see an exposed beast, but from other angles we see a covered beast. The beast is the same, but our perceptions are different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The model developed by Dai and her collaborators combines elements from general relativity, magnetic fields, radiation, and gas hydrodynamics. It shows what astronomers can expect to see when viewing tidal disruption events from different angles, allowing researchers to fit different events into a coherent framework.</p>
<p>Survey projects planned for the next few years are expected to provide much more data on tidal disruption events and will help greatly expand this field of research, according to Dai. These include the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) transient survey, led by the DARK Cosmology Centre at the Niels Bohr Institute and UC Santa Cruz, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescopes being built in Chile.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will observe hundreds to thousands of tidal disruption events in a few years. This will give us a lot of 'laboratories' to test our model and use it to understand more about black holes,&#8221; Dai said.</p>
<p>In addition to Dai and Ramirez-Ruiz, the coauthors include Jonathan McKinney, Nathaniel Roth, and Cole Miller at the University of Maryland, College Park. State-of-the-art computational tools were employed to solve the puzzle, and the simulations were carried out by Dai and Roth on the recently acquired large computer cluster made possible by a grant from the Villum Foundation for Jens Hjorth, head of DARK Cosmology Centre, as well as clusters funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and NASA.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="987d3872807270175cb4ed6b67c3a334"><name>lisa-white-true-original</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1527231600000</start-date><path>/2018/05/lisa-white-true-original</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/lisa-white-true-original</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1527271732228</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1527272811439</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text/><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/lisa-white-to.png</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/lisa-white-to.png</link><site>news</site><name>lisa-white-to.png</name><display-name>lisa-white-to.png</display-name><file-size>74408</file-size><width>295</width><height>125</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>LISA WHITE </title><description>Lisa is the director of education and public programs at the UC Museum of Paleontology, which means her job is to make sure lay people, especially students, have a chance not only to see evidence of the Earth’s changes but also to understand them.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="98aac02f807270175cb4ed6b72db12ff"><name>doby-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Educational Partnership Center executive director honored with Winston Doby Impact Award</title><summary>Maria Rocha-Ruiz, executive director of the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center, is this year’s recipient of the Dr. Winston Doby Impact Award, which recognizes her commitment to improving educational opportunities for California students.&#13;

<p>The award is given to two exceptional UC professionals who are chosen by colleagues in recognition of their individual commitment to improving educational opportunities for California students. Like Doby, recipients &#8220;demonstrate an unwavering dedication to student access, advocacy and social justice, whatever the length of their tenure at UC.&#8221; Winston C. Doby dedicated his career to increasing student diversity and access at UCLA and throughout the University of California system for more than three decades. This year&#8217;s other recipient is Penny Edgert, executive director of the Intersegmental Coordinating Committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have long known that Maria is a superstar of our campus and the region,&#8221; said Richard Hughey, Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education. &#8220;Her efforts working with hundreds of middle schools and high schools within three counties are continually making lasting impacts not just on the students they work with, but also the schools and communities in Maria&#8217;s and the Educational Partnership Center&#8217;s collaborations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Doby Impact Award is an additional recognition of Maria&#8217;s role, not just as a campus and regional leader, but also one at the state and national level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rocha-Ruiz joined UC Santa Cruz in 2006 as assistant director for Pajaro Valley GEAR UP, part of the Educational Partnership Center. By 2013, she was appointed executive director of the EPC, where she oversees ten academic access and preparation programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am truly humbled and honored by this recognition,&#8221; Rocha-Ruiz said. &#8220;Having a regional and state and national level impact to ensuring access and opportunities to postsecondary education are available to students from traditionally noncollege-going backgrounds continue to be an important driving force in what I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking forward to continue leading the EPC in catalyzing sustainable change across educational systems so that we are creating college-going and completion cultures emphasizing high academic achievement and college enrollment and success for all students in regional schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rocha-Ruiz grew up in Castroville in a low-income, migrant, farm-working family. She was one of two Mexican American students from her high school who attended a four-year university upon graduation and was the first from her immediate and extended family to not only graduate from high school but also pursue a college education.</p>
<p>While in high school, neither counselors nor teachers spoke to her about going to college or saw that she had the potential to attend an institution of higher learning. Fortunately, she liked challenging herself and, as a result, stayed on track with her &#8220;A-G&#8221; courses.</p>
<p>During the summer prior to her senior year, she participated in a program called &#8220;Yo Puedo,&#8221; a four-week residential program at UC Santa Cruz through the Monterey County of Education (MCOE) Migrant Services, which changed her trajectory. Program staff spoke to her about college, and she met college students that came from a similar background as her own.</p>
<p>Rocha-Ruiz attended UC Santa Cruz and earned a BA in psychology. From that first year in college until present day, she&#8217;s maintained her passion and commitment to ensuring students like herself are informed that they have the potential to pursue a postsecondary education, believe that they can achieve any goals that they set for themselves, and are resolute to never let others tell them otherwise. She has been a speaker at several functions delivering this message, including for her alma mater and the MCOE Migrant Services.</p>
<p>Rocha-Ruiz has nearly three decades of experience designing, implementing, managing, and evaluating programs that primarily serve low-income, underrepresented students. Her career in outreach began as an outreach coordinator at San Jose State University. Six months later, when the program moved to California State University, Monterey Bay, she was promoted to assistant director. After six years in that capacity, she served for seven years as coordinator of community services for the San Mateo- Foster City School District.</p>
<p>In 2006, she joined the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center (EPC) as assistant director for Pajaro Valley GEAR UP. The following year, she was promoted to director of GEAR UP programs in Pajaro Valley and North and South Monterey Counties. In 2013, she took the reigns as executive director of the EPC, where she oversees ten academic access and preparation programs. Rocha-Ruiz has been successful in acquiring more than $31.6 million in grant funding for the EPC for improving high school graduation and college enrollment and attainment rates for low-income and historically non-college-going families in Monterey, Santa Cruz and Santa Clara Counties. She earned a master&#8217;s in public administration from the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>Past award recipients from UC Santa Cruz include Ebony Lewis (2014), who is now the admissions director at UC Davis, and professor emerita Catherine R. Cooper (2017).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="98ee237a807270175cb4ed6b230da421"><name>shw-meetings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Public meetings to further dialogue on Student Housing West</title><summary>In an effort to further discussion on Student Housing West, UC Santa Cruz will hold two information sessions next week and two public hearings the following week.</summary><start-date>1527231600000</start-date><display-name>Student Housing West</display-name><path>/2018/05/shw-meetings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/05/shw-meetings</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1527279132302</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1527632981015</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/05/images/shw-heller-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/05/images/shw-heller-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shw-heller-500px.jpg</name><display-name>shw-heller-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>123496</file-size><width>500</width><height>221</height></image><image-alt>Student Housing West's Heller site</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>As proposed, the view of Student Housing West's Heller Drive site, viewed from Porter College.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an effort to further discussion on <a href="http://ucscstudenthousingwest.com">Student Housing West</a>, UC Santa Cruz will hold two information sessions next week and two public hearings the following week.</p>
<p>The information sessions will be held:</p>
<ul>
<li>6&#8211;7:30 p.m., May 30 at the Louden Nelson Center&#8217;s multipurpose room, 301 Center St., Santa Cruz.</li>
<li>6&#8211;7:30 p.m., May 31 at the Merrill College Cultural Center</li>
</ul>
<p>The information sessions will provide an overview of the project and additional information learned since release of the draft EIR, including information regarding costs.</p>
<p>The public hearings to receive public comments on the draft EIR will be held:</p>
<ul>
<li>5&#8211;7 p.m., June 6 at the Merrill College Cultural Center</li>
<li>6:30&#8211;8:30 p.m., June 7 at the Louden Nelson Community Center,</li>
</ul>
<p>As proposed, Student Housing West&#8212;spread over two sites, Heller Drive and Hagar Drive&#8212;will provide housing for 3,000 students. Most of the new housing units will support upper division undergraduates and graduate students at the Heller Drive site, though the project will also create new housing for students with families on Hagar Drive as well as a child care center that will serve campus employees and students.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/05/shw-eir-extension.html">announced</a> May 15 that they decided to extend the comment period to 5 p.m., June 27 and hold additional meetings so that the campus can have a more robust discussion on the proposed project and alternatives to the proposed project.</p>
<p>Following the end of the extended public comment period on June 27, the campus will evaluate all comments, from both the original comment period and the extended one, bearing in mind the project goals, which include providing affordable housing for students, and mitigating the displacement of students with families, and the goals of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to identify and avoid or reduce environmental impacts, to the extent feasible.</p>

Hosted by Dean Katharyne Mitchell, the annual Student Award Luncheon honored undergraduates and graduate students across the division.</p>
<p>"It's wonderful to celebrate our students and to recognize those whose efforts stand out on a landscape of impressive achievement," said Mitchell, who presented divisional awards, as well as campuswide deans' and chancellor's awards. "These awards are the culmination of a lot of hard work."</p>
<p>"For me, it's lovely to meet the students, their family members and friends, and their faculty mentors," added Mitchell. "I enjoy watching the amazement and thrill of parents and other community members when they learn about the extraordinary quality of the research, see the passion of the students, and observe the dedication of their mentors."</p>
<p><u>Division of Social Sciences Awards</u></p>
<p><em>Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship</em>: This <a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/zimmerman/index.html">scholarship</a> was established to honor Gabriel "Gabe" Zimmerman, the alum who was shot and killed in the 2011 attack on Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Zimmerman was working as Giffords' community outreach director at a constituent-engagement event he had organized when gunshots rang out; he ran towards Giffords, who was gravely wounded in the assassination attempt. Gabe was killed. The scholarship was established in the weeks after the shooting by UC Santa Cruz graduates Jonathan Klein (Merrill '89, politics) and Alex Clemens (Porter '89, international politics) and has since attracted support from more than 520 donors. It supports undergraduates who are passionate about social issues and committed to social service.</p>

(Photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Mass incarceration, solitary confinement, and the possibility for meaningful change in the American prison system took center stage in the standing-room-only Bhojwani Room of the University Center on May 22.</p>
<p>Distinguished Professor of Psychology Craig Haney introduced the panel of speakers by saying all four have experienced the criminal justice system from the inside and now devote their lives to its abolition. Angela Davis was held in prison for 16 months before she was acquitted of the charges related to a 1970 shooting. Debbie Kilroy spent three years locked up for selling cannabis during an undercover police sting in Australia. Robert King and Albert Woodfox served a total of 72 years in solitary confinement &#8212; 29 years for King and 43 for Woodfox &#8212; at Louisiana&#8217;s notorious Angola Prison.</p>
<p>On display was a large photo of the third member of the &#8220;Angola 3,&#8221; Herman Wallace, who died of cancer three days after he was released. All three were imprisoned in 6-foot-by&#8211;9-foot cells at what was once a 19th-century slave plantation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s helpful to recognize that punishment in the form of imprisonment bears a direct relationship to slavery,&#8221; said Davis, an iconic activist and distinguished professor emerita at UC Santa Cruz. Davis was a professor in the History of Consciousness Department for 17 years until her 2008 retirement.</p>
<p>The emergence of what&#8217;s called mass incarceration can be traced back to the 19th century, right after slavery was outlawed, when &#8220;free black bodies had to be managed,&#8221; she said. Now the United States, with just 5 percent of the world&#8217;s population, has 25 percent of the world&#8217;s prisoners&#8212;or 2.2 million people in jails, detention centers and prisons, and a disproportionate number of them are black.</p>
<p>Woodfox also referred to slavery when he talked about the economic exploitation of prison labor by major corporations. &#8220;Every prisoner represents profit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The irony is that companies will freely use &#8216;slave labor&#8217; to produce their products, but if an individual is lucky enough to be released from prison, they won&#8217;t hire him &#8230; now he&#8217;s of no value to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haney, a leading expert on the psychology of imprisonment, suggested that today&#8217;s prison system has more than a historical or metaphorical connection with slavery.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a literal embodiment of what slavery was and still is,&#8220; Haney said. &#8221;You look around, and you see mostly African-American men working in the fields, overseen by mostly white men on horseback, with rifles over their laps, and this is today. This isn&#8217;t the Jim Crow era. You blink your eyes and you don&#8217;t know what century you&#8217;re in.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to solitary confinement, what was created as a means of punishment became the warehousing of a segment of society, said Woodfox, who was released in 2016 after being in confinement since 1972.</p>
<p>Initially jailed for armed robbery, Woodfox was later charged with the murder of a prison guard. Eventually, judges upheld unanimously that his murder conviction had been secured as a result of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>Looking at King and Woodfox, Haney said, &#8220;Both of you, and Herman, as well, had exemplary records while you were in solitary confinement. It had nothing to do with you continuing to engage in infractions and getting punished for them. It had to do with who you were and the system deciding it wanted to keep you there, essentially, forever. It&#8217;s an example of the system giving up on people for all time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kilroy, the only convicted drug trafficker to be admitted as a lawyer in Australia, said it&#8217;s contradictory to use the term &#8220;justice system,&#8221; because there&#8217;s nothing &#8220;just&#8221; about it. She and others on the panel advocate &#8220;decarceration&#8221; strategies rather than prison reform, saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s a myth that reform helps anyone that&#8217;s captured in the prison industrial complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Davis put it, the pendulum of reform has swung back and forth for 200 years, and the prison system has only become stronger and more permanent. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to recognize that reform hasn&#8217;t worked, and more than likely, it&#8217;s not going to work in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>She calls for a transformation of society so it no longer relies on prison repression, describing a process of &#8220;discovering, imagining, creating a form of justice that heals&#8221; and ends the cycle of retribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if this does not seem to be immediately on the horizon, even if this seems to be so far in the future that it seems to constitute the musings of an idealist, we still have to do it. Even if we don&#8217;t get to experience (the results of) it, other generations will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis said social activists everywhere help this cause when they advocate for better education and housing, and address gender violence.</p>
<p>King said he doesn&#8217;t know if there is a solution, &#8220;but I sure know that imprisonment is not the answer.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valeria Jacqueline </span></span><span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="valonsob@ucsc.edu" email="valonsob@ucsc.edu" name="Valeria Jacqueline Alonso">Alonso Blanco (Crown, psychology, &#8217;18) has worked hard to help first-generation and undocumented students overcome obstacles and transfer to UC Santa Cruz. Now the University of California is honoring her with a prestigious President&#8217;s Award for Outstanding Student Leadership, recognizing the impact of her advocacy and activism. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full impact of this good news didn&#8217;t kick in until she was invited to address the UC Board of Regents at a recent meeting, and saw the faces of her family members in the audience. &#8220;Knowing that they were very proud of me was what made this unforgettable,&#8221; she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanco, affectionately known as &#8220;Jacque,&#8221; is being honored for helping to create a more diverse pipeline of college-bound students. On top of her course load at UC Santa Cruz, she has worked hard to help prepare first-generation and undocumented students to transfer to UC campuses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Quite simply, Jacque&#8217;s work has improved, and will continue to&#160;improve, the educational experience of first-generation, undocumented, and Latinx students throughout all of UC,&#8221; UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal said at the Regents meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a campus, we&#8217;ve discovered there is no one-size-fits-all support program when it comes to transfer students,&#8221; Blumenthal continued. &#8220;It takes boots-on-the-ground work. It&#8217;s about identifying the needs of individual students, and working to meet them, one student at a time. In other words, it takes programs just like the one Jacque has helped build. Jacque, thank you for all that you do. You are a credit to your family, to UC Santa Cruz, and to the entire UC system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC President Janet Napolitano presented the awards during the meeting. &#8220;Student activism and public service have been a hallmark of the University of California and its students for 150 years,&#8221; Napolitano said. &#8220;This year&#8217;s winners represent the best of that tradition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanco is deeply involved with the Cultivamos Excelencia Hispanic Serving Institution Initiative at UC Santa Cruz, developing and implementing a program that prepares SJCC students to transfer to UC Santa Cruz. She also provides academic and emotional support to migrant youth in Watsonville through her work with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Educational Partnership Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her work, she has drawn extensively on her own undergraduate research as well as her experience as a first-gen student and a child of immigrants. Drawing from her life, she came to understand the essential role that families play in students&#8217; decisions to pursue higher education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, at UC Santa Cruz, she realized that she was one of the few first-generation Latinx students who had the opportunity to pursue higher education &#8220;due to the many racial, economic, and cultural barriers found in the U.S. educational systems. It was this realization that motivated me to find ways to use the privilege I had of attending college.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My freshman year, as a research assistant, I realized I could use research to build culturally relevant practices and strategies to increase enrollment and retention of underrepresented youth in higher education,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know many parents migrate to the United States for the same reasons mine did, and I hope the university can increase their efforts to change policy and give underrepresented students the opportunity they have worked so hard for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduation, she plans to continue her work at Cultivamos Excelencia and the Culture and Achievement Collaborative. In the fall, she will apply to graduate school. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ae463a27807270175cb4ed6b695f2735"><name>commencement-preview</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus gearing up for commencement 2018</title><summary>For the first time in more than a decade, exercises will be held in the newly renovated Quarry Amphitheater, as well as on the East Field. &#13;

<div>Tuesday, June 5, is Election Day in California. There are important matters on the ballot&#8212;primary candidates for governor as well as federal, state and local offices in addition to several local and state initiatives. Voting is a citizen's fundamental right, and UC Santa Cruz urges you to let your voice be heard.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>This year, the campus is making it as easy as possible for you to cast your ballot.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://urelations.ucsc.edu/about/units/government/vote/index.html">Six campus polling stations</a> will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, June 5. All will accept mail-in ballots. In addition, you may deposit your completed ballot in a new Official Ballot Drop Box that has been installed in Quarry Plaza in front of Bay Tree Bookstore.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Not registered to vote?</strong></div>
<div>You can still participate!</div>
<div></div>
<div>This year, the State of California is allowing <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/conditional-voter-reg/">Conditional Voter Registration</a> at select polling locations, including the Bay Tree Bookstore and the Santa Cruz County Elections office.&#160; At these sites, you can register and vote conditionally. Conditional ballots will be processed once the county elections office has completed the voter registration verification process.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Voters can complete the conditional voter registration process from May 22 all the way through Election Day on June 5. You will need to bring your California driver&#8217;s license or Social Security Number and you will need to provide your dorm room and campus PO box if you live on campus.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Registered to vote back home?</strong></div>
<div>If you are a student and are registered to vote in your home county you must mail in an absentee ballot and it must be posted by June 5 and received by June 8. If you have a mail ballot and are registered in Santa Cruz County, you can mail before June 5 or hand it in at any polling place on Election Day.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you&#8217;re unsure about your voter registration status, you can check your polling location and <a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/">voting information online</a>.

<p>The genes appeared between 3 and 4 million years ago, just before the period when fossils show a dramatic increase in the brain sizes of human ancestors. In modern humans, the genes are involved in genetic defects associated with neurological disorders.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30383-0">Published May 31 in <em>Cell</em></a>, the study represents more than five years of work to characterize the genes, their role in neurological development, and their evolutionary origins. They belong to an ancient family of genes known as Notch genes, first discovered in fruit flies and named for a genetic defect causing notched wings.</p>
<p>"This is a family of genes that goes back hundreds of millions of years in evolutionary history and is known to play important roles in embryonic development. To find that humans have a new member of this family that is involved in brain development is extremely exciting," said senior author David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and scientific director of the <a href="https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>.</p>
<p>The site of the genes on the long arm of chromosome 1 is involved in genetic defects in which large segments of DNA are either duplicated or deleted, leading to neurological disorders known collectively as 1q21.1 deletion/duplication syndrome. Deletions are often associated with microcephaly (abnormally small head size) and autism, while duplications are often associated with macrocephaly (abnormally large head size) and schizophrenia.</p>
<p><strong>Common ancestor</strong></p>
<p>The new human-specific Notch genes were derived from <em>NOTCH2</em>, one of four previously known mammalian Notch genes, through a duplication event that inserted an extra partial copy of <em>NOTCH2</em> into the genome. This happened in an ancient ape species that was a common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. The partial duplicate was a nonfunctional "pseudogene," versions of which are still found in chimp and gorilla genomes. In the human lineage, however, this pseudogene was "revived" when additional <em>NOTCH2</em> DNA was copied into its place, creating a functional gene. This new gene was then duplicated several more times, resulting in four related genes, called <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes, found only in humans.</p>
<p>One of the four <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes appears to be a nonfunctional pseudogene, but the other three (<em>NOTCH2NLA, NOTCH2NLB</em>, and <em>NOTCH2NLC</em>) are active genes that direct the production of truncated versions of the original NOTCH2 protein. Notch proteins are involved in signaling between and within cells. In many cases, the Notch signaling pathway regulates the differentiation of stem cells in developing organs throughout the body, telling stem cells when to become, for example, mature heart cells or neurons.</p>
<p>"Notch signaling was already known to be important in the developing nervous system," said senior author Sofie Salama, a research scientist at UC Santa Cruz. "<em>NOTCH2NL</em> seems to amplify Notch signaling, which leads to increased proliferation of neural stem cells and delayed neural maturation."</p>
<p><strong>Radial glia</strong></p>
<p>The <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes are especially active in the pool of neural stem cells thought to generate most of the cortical neurons. By delaying their maturation, the genes allow a larger pool of these stem cells (called "radial glia") to build up in the developing brain, ultimately leading to a larger number of mature neurons in the neocortex (the outer layer of the brain in mammals; in humans, it hosts higher cognitive functions such as language and reasoning).</p>
<p>This delayed development of cortical neurons fits a pattern of delayed maturation characteristic of human development, Haussler said. "One of our most distinguishing features is larger brains and delayed brain development, and now we're seeing molecular mechanisms supporting this evolutionary trend even at a very early stage of brain development," he said.</p>
<p>Salama noted that the new genes are just one of many factors that contribute to cortical development in humans. "<em>NOTCH2NL</em> doesn't act in a vacuum, but it arose at a provocative time in human evolution, and it is associated with neural developmental disorders. That combination makes it especially interesting," she said.</p>
<p>The DNA copying errors that created the <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes in the first place are the same type of errors that cause the 1q21.1 deletion/duplication syndrome. These errors tend to occur in places on the chromosomes where there are long stretches of nearly identical DNA sequences.</p>
<p>"These long segments of DNA that are almost identical can confuse the replication machinery and cause instability in the genome," Haussler explained. "We may have gained our larger brains in part through the duplication of these genes, but at the expense of greater instability in that region of chromosome 1, which makes us susceptible to the deletion/duplication syndrome."</p>
<p><strong>Reference genome</strong></p>
<p>Long stretches of repetitive DNA also present challenges for DNA sequencing technologies. In fact, the location of <em>NOTCH2NL</em> in the human reference genome was not accurate when Haussler's team first started investigating it.</p>
<p>"When we looked at the reference genome to see where <em>NOTCH2NL</em> was, we found that it was near the area involved in the 1q21.1 syndrome, but not part of the region that was deleted or duplicated," Haussler said. "This explains why the gene was not looked at before by geneticists studying the syndrome."</p>
<p>After checking other genome data and contacting the team working on the next iteration of the reference genome, however, Haussler found that <em>NOTCH2NL</em> is in fact located in the interval where the defects occur. The new reference genome (the 38th version, released later in 2013) also shows the additional copies of the gene. Haussler's team subsequently showed that the duplications or deletions in the syndrome result in an increase or decrease (respectively) in the number of copies of NOTCH2NL genes in the affected person's genome. Other genes are also duplicated or deleted and may also be involved in the syndrome.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these genetic changes do not always result in neurological disorders. In about 20 to 50 percent of affected children, the syndrome is the result of a new genetic mistake, but in many cases one of the parents is found to also carry the genetic defect, without showing any apparent symptoms. According to Haussler, this is not uncommon in genetic diseases and underscores the importance of multiple factors in the development of disease.</p>
<p>"It's amazing how often we find people with what seem to be serious genetic conditions, yet something else compensates for it," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Cortical organoids</strong></p>
<p>The investigation of these genes began in 2012 when Frank Jacobs, now at the University of Amsterdam and the third senior author of the paper, was working with Haussler and Salama at UC Santa Cruz as a postdoctoral researcher. His project involved coaxing human embryonic stem cells to differentiate into neurons and studying the genes that are expressed during this process. As the cells develop into cortical neurons in the petri dish, they self-organize into a layered structure like a miniature version of the brain's cortex, which researchers call a "cortical organoid."</p>
<p>Jacobs was comparing gene expression patterns in cortical organoids grown from embryonic stem cells of humans and rhesus monkeys. Many genes showed differences in the timing and amount of expression, but <em>NOTCH2NL</em> was exceptional. "It was screaming hot in human cells and zero in rhesus. Rhesus cells just don't have this gene," Salama said. "Finding a new Notch gene in humans set us off on a long journey."</p>
<p>Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, said he remembers presenting their initial findings in 2013 to scientists at HHMI. "Their general reaction was, 'Well, it's amazing if it's true, but we're not convinced yet.' So we spent the next five years working to convince everybody."</p>
<p>The development of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for making genetic modifications provided a crucial tool for their work. Salama's team used it to delete the <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes from human embryonic stem cells. Cortical organoids grown from these cells showed an acceleration of neural maturation and were smaller in size than organoids from normal cells. The researchers also inserted <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes into mouse embryonic stem cells and showed that the genes promote Notch signaling and delay neural maturation in mouse cortical organoids.</p>
<p>"The fact that we can genetically manipulate stem cells with CRISPR and then grow them into cortical organoids in the lab is extremely powerful," Haussler said. "My dream for decades has been to peer into human evolution at the level of individual genes and gene functions. It's incredibly exciting that we're able to do that now."</p>
<p><strong>Modern humans<br/></strong></p>
<p>A major part of the research involved careful and precise sequencing of the region of chromosome 1 where the <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes are located in 8 normal individuals and 6 patients with 1q21.1 deletion/duplication syndrome. (The researchers also analyzed the genomes of three archaic humans, two Neanderthals, and one Denisovan, finding in all of them the same three active <em>NOTCH2NL</em> genes that are present in modern humans.)</p>
<p>The sequencing results showed that the NOTCH2NL genes are variable in modern humans. The researchers identified eight different versions of <em>NOTCH2NL</em>, and Haussler said there are probably more. Each version has a slightly different DNA sequence, but it remains unclear what effects these differences may have.</p>
<p>"We've found that all of them can promote Notch signaling. They behaved in subtly different ways when we tested them in cell cultures, but we have a lot more work to do before we can start to get a handle on what this means," Salama said.</p>
<p>Other genes involved in human brain development seem to have arisen through a duplication process similar to the creation of <em>NOTCH2NL</em>. A notable example is the gene <em>SRGAP2C</em>, which is thought to increase the number of connections between neurons. Locations in the genome where such duplications and rearrangements occur repeatedly, known as "duplication hubs," make up about 5 percent of the human genome and seem to have been important in human evolution, Haussler said.</p>
