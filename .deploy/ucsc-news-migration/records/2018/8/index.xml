Nicknamed the "hobbit" (officially <em>Homo floresiensis</em>), it remains a mysterious species with an unknown relationship to modern humans.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the current inhabitants of Flores include a pygmy population living in a village near the Liang Bua cave where the fossils were found. An international team of scientists has now sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 32 people in this population. The analysis revealed evolutionary changes associated with diet and short stature in the pygmy population, but the researchers found no evidence of genetic elements that might have come from <em>H. floresiensi</em>s.</p>
<p>"If there was any chance to know the hobbit genetically from the genomes of extant humans, this would have been it. But we don&#8217;t see it. There is no indication of gene flow from the hobbit into people living today," said Richard E. Green, associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and corresponding author of a paper on the findings published August 3 in <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Thus far, no one has been able to recover DNA from the <em>H. floresiensis</em> fossils. The researchers therefore searched the pygmy genome for any evidence of DNA sequences from an unknown ancient human lineage.</p>
<p>Green and other researchers previously recovered and sequenced DNA from fossils of other archaic humans&#8212;the Neanderthals and Denisovans&#8212;and determined that the genomes of some modern humans include DNA sequences inherited from those extinct human species. Those findings mean some interbreeding occurred in the distant past. The genomes of the Flores pygmies include small amounts of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA, similar to other populations in Southeast Asia and Melanesia.</p>
<p>"Genetically, they're not so different from other populations in that part of the world," Green said.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic variants</strong></p>
<p>Where they are different is in genes related to height and diet. Height is a very heritable trait, and geneticists have identified many genes for which certain variants are associated with taller or shorter stature. Green and his colleagues analyzed the Flores pygmy genomes with respect to height-associated genes identified in Europeans, and they found a high frequency of genetic variants associated with decreased height. This indicates that the evolution of short stature in the Flores pygmies was the result of natural selection acting on pre-existing genetic variation.</p>
<p>"It sounds like a boring result, but it's actually quite meaningful," Green said. "It means that these gene variants were present in a common ancestor of Europeans and the Flores pygmies. They became short by selection acting on this standing variation already present in the population, so there's little need for genes from an archaic hominin to explain their small stature."</p>
<p>Coauthor Peter Visscher at the University of Queensland, Australia, said the study addresses fundamental questions about human adaptation. "Just as livestock breeding happens through small changes in gene frequencies at very many loci, human adaptation works by exploiting the pool of polygenic variation available for selection," Visscher said.</p>
<p>The Flores pygmy genome showed evidence of selection in genes for enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, called FADS enzymes (fatty acid desaturase). These genes have been associated with dietary adaptations in other populations, including the Inuit in Greenland. "It suggests that something in the past caused their diet to change dramatically, and they adapted by natural selection favoring certain variants of those genes," Green said.</p>
<p>The fossil evidence indicates <em>H. floresiensis</em> was significantly smaller than the Flores pygmies, standing about three and a half feet tall (106 centimeters). The average height of the pygmies is more than a foot taller (145 centimeters).</p>
<p><strong>Island dwarfism</strong></p>
<p>The evolution of reduced body size in large mammals isolated on islands is a common phenomenon, often attributed to limited food resources and freedom from predators. At the time of <em>H. floresiensis</em>, Flores was also home to a dwarf elephant related to a now extinct species of mainland elephant. In general, large species tend to get smaller and small species tend to get larger on islands. The Flores giant rat is an example of the latter tendency.</p>
<p>"Weird things happen on islands," Green said. "With the gene pool cut off from the larger population, an island population is free to evolve in unrestrained directions based on the demands of a small ecosystem."</p>
<p>It is interesting that two different human species, one modern and the other now extinct, independently evolved short stature on Flores Island, he said. For now, however, the origins and relationships of the Flores hobbit, <em>H. floresiensis,</em> remain a mystery.</p>

<p>Based on a review of the effects of three decades of U.S. immigration policy, the policy statement details the psychosocial and economic impacts of deportation on children and families, as well as broader community consequences that unfold as immigrants fearful of being targeted withdraw from civic engagement.</p>
<p>"This policy brief is a thorough examination of the research," said Regina Langhout, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and lead author of the brief; the policy statement will appear in the upcoming edition of the <em>American Journal of Community Psychology</em>, which is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajcp.12256">available online now</a>.</p>
<p>"U.S. immigration and deportation policies have negative effects for everybody&#8212;not just in immigrant communities, but for everybody," said Langhout. "When families are torn apart without their consent, it has very negative outcomes for everyone."</p>
<p>Langhout and her coauthors underscore the psychological trauma and material hardship experienced by U.S.-born children of immigrants, and the number of people impacted by current deportation policies, before recommending changes to federal and local policy. Among their conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studies reveal that children who lose a parent to sudden, forced deportation experience anxiety, anger, aggression, withdrawal, a heightened sense of fear, eating and sleeping disturbances, isolation, trauma, and depression.</li>
<li>Children also experience housing instability, academic withdrawal, and family dissolution; older children often need to take on jobs to help support the family.</li>
<li>Ten percent of U.S. families with children have at least one family member who lacks citizenship.&#160;</li>
<li>5.9 million children have at least one caregiver who lacks authorization to live in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes to U.S. immigration policy over the last 30 years have resulted in a massive increase in deportations&#8212;and a marked shift away from post-World War II-era policies that focused on family reunification, the authors found.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>From 1900 to 1990, approximately 20,000 people were deported each year. In the mid-1990s, the rate increased by 800 percent to 180,000 a year&#8212;and has since more than doubled to 340,000 deportations in 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>Immigration raids and deportations generate fear and mistrust that have ripple effects, according to the authors. Fearful of being targeted, community members become less likely to participate in churches, schools, health clinics, cultural activities, and social services.</p>
<p>"As a scholar and social-community psychologist, my job is to figure out what creates healthy, strong, vibrant communities, and to share research findings in an attempt to influence public policy," said Langhout. "We can be a barometer of this, because we know the research."</p>
<p>Deportations become a public health issue as feelings of belonging and connection are broken down, she said. "When a group feels terrorized, being able to connect breaks down," said Langhout. "Those targeted stop participating in public life, and that breaks down the entire community."</p>
<p>The effects are sufficiently widespread and dire that Langhout and her coauthors outline several national and local-level policy recommendations to alleviate suffering among U.S.-born children, beginning with comprehensive immigration reform that would end the threat of deportation by providing permanent protection for 11 million people who lack authorization to remain in the United States. Their "child-first" recommendations also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No forcible separation of families</li>
<li>Modify laws to allow extended family caregivers, such as grandparents, to qualify for exemption from deportation</li>
<li>Take a public health perspective on deportation, recognizing the direct and indirect impacts on community members</li>
<li>Create a human rights framework in U.S. immigration policy</li>
<li>Local jurisdictions should declare themselves sanctuary cities to enhance the protection of unauthorized immigrants and their families, and they should not detain or deport people solely for immigration violations.</li>
<li>Local school districts should communicate with their communities and prioritize safety and inclusion for all immigrant families, including building a protocol for responding to federal immigration activity near schools and educating school personnel on the effects of immigration enforcement.</li>
<li>Schools, places of worship, and community organizations must build supportive social networks that create a sense of belonging among families that are coping with the effects of deportation.</li>
</ul>
<p>"If we're going to have neighborhoods and towns and schools and places where people of all different backgrounds interact, it's imperative for public health that everybody feels a sense of belonging and connection, a sense of attachment," said Langhout.</p>

<p>He loved his interactions with the students at Crown, particularly leading the summer student paint crew. On three occasions, he was selected by the students of Crown to hand out diplomas at graduation, a high honor. When he had to have brain surgery to remove a benign tumor, the university staff donated three months of vacation leave.</p>
<p>During his convalescence, the students at Crown made a colorful mobile of a thousand origami paper cranes, which still hang in Ben&#8217;s room. Ben was noted for his extensive and varied music tastes while at Crown, and many people would tune into his playlists. Ben liked to say he &#8220;played a mean turn-table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ben is survived by his partner of 33 years, Tutti Hacking; daughters Hannah and Zo&#235; Doniach (Santa Cruz), Rori Launspach and grand-daughter Madison Jane Garfinkel-Launspach (San Jose); his father Sebastian Doniach, step-mother Jennifer Doniach, brother Joseph Doniach (Palo Alto); sisters Alex Doniach (San Francisco), Martha Doniach (London), Tabitha Doniach (Santa Rosa); and his step-father Richard Joseph (Tucson).</p>

<p>The new findings, which shed light on how we make moral and political decisions on polarizing issues such as abortion, immigration, and waterboarding, reveal that adolescents and adults can&#8212;and do&#8212;reason deeply about highly complex moral issues.</p>
<p>"When confronted with very, very hard questions about the value of life, decisions are grounded in multiple and sometimes competing considerations about harm, welfare, individual rights, fairness, and justice," said lead author Audun Dahl, associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "And contrary to popular belief, people are quite able to articulate all of this when asked to justify how they arrived at their decision."</p>
<p><strong>The "trolley dilemma"</strong></p>
<p>The study explores moral reasoning in the context of the famous "trolley dilemma." In 1967, moral philosopher Philippa Foot introduced the now-classic hypothetical dilemma: A train is hurtling down a track about to hit and kill five people, but a bystander can throw a switch and divert the train to another track, saving five lives. If they do, however, they will kill one person who is tied to the other track. What is the right thing to do? Most people say they would divert the train.</p>
<p>In a second scenario, five people are tied to a track. A bystander on a footbridge above the track can push one man to his death on the track, taking one life to save five others. In <em>this</em> scenario, most people say it would be wrong to push the man, although the number of saved lives would be the same as in the earlier scenario with the switch.</p>
<p>Why do people respond so differently to the two scenarios? In 2001, an influential neuroscience paper proposed that the responses stemmed from two distinct psychological processes: moral reasoning in the first scenario, based on the number of lives saved, as distinct from an automatic "gut reaction" in the footbridge scenario. The "dual-process" theory of morality holds that people rely on emotional, automatic reactions to make moral judgments most of the time, and they use moral reasoning only occasionally. The theory has changed the fields of moral psychology and philosophy, and it even spurred a subfield known as "trolleyology." It has also gained widespread popular acceptance, with some pundits attributing the current cultural and political divide to innate, automatic intuitions instead of reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>A developmental approach</strong></p>
<p>Dahl, however, was unconvinced. A developmental psychologist, he sees reasoning about moral issues emerge in children as young as 3 years of age. "Even preschool-age children can reason, and despite their linguistic limitations, they can provide explanations for their moral judgments," he said. "So we wanted to take our interview methods and apply them to the trolley scenarios and see if adolescents and adults were really unable to reason about these scenarios." Understanding how people make decisions in extreme hypothetical situations illuminates how people make decisions and act in everyday life, said Dahl. "Almost every human conflict involves judgments about right and wrong," he noted.</p>
<p>Dahl and his coauthors posed the trolley scenarios to 432 adolescents, college students, and other adults and conducted in-depth interviews in search of insights into their moral reasoning.</p>
<p>"Our findings rebut the notion that adults can't reason about moral issues," said Dahl. "Both adolescents and adults considered a number of factors in addition to the number of lives that would be saved: the fundamental value of life, the intrinsic rights of individuals, their involvement and their responsibilities in the scenarios, as well as guilt and social repercussions," said Dahl. "People were able to provide reasons for their decisions in both scenarios, and their justifications were consistent with their judgments across situations."</p>
<p>If moral reasoning were just about counting lives, reasoning about the trolley dilemmas would be easy, noted Dahl.</p>
<p>"But our participants found both scenarios to be extremely hard," he said. "They brought the same competing considerations to both." In both situations, people recognized the value of life, they want to maximize the welfare of all, and they bring notions of innocence into the scenarios. "People expressed a lot of conflict even about the switch scenario," added Dahl, "Either way, they said they would feel horrible. It shows how fundamentally central conflict is to moral reasoning about hard cases."</p>
<p><strong>It's complicated</strong></p>
<p>There is scant research about how people reason morally about the value of life and even less that involves conflicting situations.</p>
<p>"When people reason about moral issues, they often bring a host of different principles that are in tension, and they struggle with it. People experience conflict," said Dahl. "Everybody agrees that the value of life is important, but when they are asked to judge, it gets complicated. On the one hand, people think it&#8217;s better to save more people. On the other hand, they view the value of each individual life as unmeasurable. Their own internal conflict can help them accept that other people arrive at different judgments."</p>
<p>This is where Dahl sees hope that a deeper understanding of the process of moral reasoning will foster better discussions about divisive moral issues such as capital punishment, abortion, torture, drones, and border security.</p>
<p>"We need to recognize that moral decision making, especially around contentious issues, involves being conflicted," said Dahl. "People with divergent views are often weighing the same principles, but they prioritize them differently." One of the great things about these anonymous research interviews, as opposed to public debates, is that people acknowledge how conflicted they sometimes are."</p>
<p>Unlike philosophical theories of morality, which often aim for a single &#8220;right answer&#8221; to moral dilemmas, Dahl's findings indicate that inconsistency and tension are integral parts of human moral reasoning. "Being a morally mature, developed person doesn't mean you have a clean set of coherent beliefs," he said. "Some inner tensions are part of our moral system."</p>
<p>Dahl hopes his team's findings will reach beyond developmental psychology and lay the foundation for additional investigation.</p>

The interdisciplinary master's degree program will prepare students to design and implement solutions to the complex social, ecological, and technological problems facing the world's coastal ecosystems and communities.</p>
<p>Building on UCSC's long-standing leadership in coastal science and in addressing real-world environmental challenges, the program is designed to teach students the practical skills, interdisciplinary knowledge, and innovative approaches needed to solve threats and realize emerging opportunities for coastal sustainability. Students completing the program will receive a Master of Science in Coastal Science and Policy.</p>
<p>"Our program is distinctive for its focus on training emerging leaders to excel at developing and pursuing actionable sustainability solutions," said Anne R. Kapuscinski, professor of environmental studies and incoming director of the Coastal Science and Policy program. "Students will emerge from our interdisciplinary curriculum and immersion in real-world projects prepared to take on the coasts' greatest challenges and opportunities for sustainability."</p>
<p>"We had an impressive and highly competitive group of applicants for the first cohort, and we're thrilled about the students chosen to inaugurate the program," said co-director Don Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. "The students we chose span a wide range of disciplinary and geographic diversity, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the Coastal Science and Policy program itself."</p>
<p>Applicants for the program's inaugural class included prospective students from coastal regions in 28 countries around the world and from across the United States. Ten students representing seven countries were chosen from a pool of more than 100 applicants. They include Shakera Arnold from Belize City, Belize, who has worked for the past eight years as a marine reserve manager for the Belize Fisheries Department; David Torres, a forest engineer from Cuzco, Peru, who is working to reduce deforestation in key landscapes of his country; Ross Davison of Mountain View, California, who has headed conservation projects around the world and is currently using drone imagery to create high-resolution maps, models, and conservation materials for marsh ecosystems; and Casey Zweig, who currently leads environmental programs for the City of Malibu with a strong focus in coastal issues. More information about the inaugural class of Coastal Science and Policy students is <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/people/current-students/">available online</a>.</p>
<p>Kapuscinski comes to UC Santa Cruz from Dartmouth College, where she was a professor of sustainability science in the Environmental Studies Program. She is chair of the Board of Directors of the Union of Concerned Scientists and has served as scientific advisor to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, the World Health Organization, and other national and international agencies. She is the inaugural editor in chief of the sustainability transitions domain of the online journal <em>Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene</em>. Kapuscinski's research stresses a systems approach to sustainability challenges, integrating across ecological, social, and economic domains of the problem, with a current emphasis on shifting aquaculture to sustainability.</p>
<p>Faculty with expertise in a broad range of fields in both the natural sciences and the social sciences have developed an integrated curriculum for the program, with intensive courses that are practical and project-based, in subjects ranging from statistics and coastal governance to facilitating change and decision analysis. A focus on developing solutions rather than describing problems will orient students to systematically identify problems and threats, explore potential solutions, and pursue feasible options. They will also work directly with partners outside the university to develop and implement practical solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<p>An intensive internship during the first summer of the program will have students working with a faculty mentor and a mentor from a partner institution (which may be a private, government, or non-governmental organization) to identify and initiate a potential capstone project. Year two consists of an immersion with the partner institution to work on the project addressing a real sustainability issue. Second-year students also attend a seminar in which they share their issues and progress with faculty and fellow students.</p>
<p>A successful fundraising effort has enabled the program to offer graduate fellowships covering tuition and living expenses to all students entering the program, which helps to ensure broad access. Major donors to the program include the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, Wells Fargo Foundation, and anonymous donors.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="01abd302807270175cb4ed6be737625b"><name>noller-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Harry Noller to receive Biophysical Society's 2019 Ignacio Tinoco Award</title><summary>Molecular biologist Harry Noller has been chosen by the Biophysical Society (BPS) to receive its 2019 Ignacio Tinoco Award.</summary><start-date>1533279600000</start-date><display-name>Harry Noller to receive 2019 BPS Ignacio Tinoco Award</display-name><path>/2018/08/noller-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/08/noller-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1533331361228</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1533331614632</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/harry-noller-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/harry-noller-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>harry-noller-400.jpg</name><display-name>harry-noller-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>104557</file-size><width>400</width><height>474</height></image><image-alt>Harry Noller</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/12/images/harry-noller-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/12/images/harry-noller-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>harry-noller-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>harry-noller-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17445</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Harry Noller</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Harry Noller (photo by C.

<p>&#8220;Nacho Tinoco challenged our community to continually push our fundamental understanding of biophysics,&#8221; said BPS President Angela Gronenborn of the University of Pittsburgh. &#8220;He promoted an open, inclusive, and collaborative research environment in his field, positively impacting all of those who were around him. Harry has lived up to this shining example. We are very pleased that Harry is receiving this award for his commitment to fostering inclusive and collaborative research teams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noller directs the <a href="http://rna.ucsc.edu/rnacenter/">Center for Molecular Biology of RNA</a> at UC Santa Cruz. His research is concerned with the structure and function of ribosomes, the protein factories of all living cells and an important target for antibiotics. Work in Noller's lab has led to the elucidation of the structure of the complete ribosome, showing its interactions with other molecules and demonstrating that the ribosome is a macromolecular machine whose functional properties are based on RNA rather than protein. He has received many honors for his work, including the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/12/noller-prize.html">2017 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences</a> and the Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award for Distinguished Work in Basic Medical Science. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1992.</p>
<p>Tinoco&#8217;s contributions to the spectroscopic, thermodynamic, structural, and single-molecule study of biopolymers consistently deepened the understanding of fundamental biophysical principles, constantly moving the field toward new frontiers. Through his unconditional devotion to science, he established a highly cooperative, generous, inclusive, and friendly environment for scientific discovery and advancement. The Tinoco Award recognizes meritorious investigators who make fundamental contributions to the physical chemistry of biopolymers or who actively promote and sustain a collaborative, inclusive, and engaging research environment in the field.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/engage/Sustainability Certificate Program/index.html">Sustainability Certificate Program</a>, created by the Office of Sustainability, went through a pilot run last academic year and is preparing for a formal launch in fall. Registration will open Aug. 14 on the <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/training/learning-center/index.html">UC Learning Site</a>.</p>
<p>Sustainability Program Manager Shauna Casey said the office has long focused on providing practical advice: how to avoid creating trash, tips on recycling, tools for minimizing your energy demands, and more. The office, however, noticed a growing need to support campus employees in discussing sustainability in a deeper and more meaningful way.</p>
<p>&#8220;The certificate program seeks to examine sustainability not only through the lens of the environment, but also through the lens of people. It&#8217;s not just &#8217;how do we reach a goal like, say, reducing carbon emissions,&#8217; but 'how do we do so in a way that respects people where they&#8217;re at' given that sustainability solutions often privilege people with means?&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, when considering strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Santa Cruz, the solution of living closer to where you work is simply not possible for most people given the costs of housing compared to wages.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we frame sustainability so that its inclusive of these considerations at once?&#8221; Casey asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s not an easy thing to do, and we certainly don&#8217;t do it perfectly, but this is what we&#8217;re aiming for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Casey said the program was modeled after the campus&#8217;s lauded Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program. To earn a certificate, participants must complete six required core courses and one elective within two academic years.</p>
<p>The program is designed to take a holistic look at sustainability and not break it into specific topics, such as water, energy, or transportation, Casey said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to get people&#8217;s gears turning and see them making connections they hadn&#8217;t before,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This approach lends a richness.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Intersections Between Diversity &amp; Environment</em> explores how certain forms of environmentalism have perpetuated discrimination and helps participants consider ways to approach sustainability in a way that is more inclusive. The course is taught by Colleges 9 and 10 Provost Flora Lu, American Indian Resource Center Director Rebecca Hernandez, and Sustainability Office Director Elida Erickson.&#160;</p>
<p>Professor Chris Benner teaches a course on sustainable cities and social equity that examines global patterns of urbanization and plans for developing more urban cities, particularly in California.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Kevin Koenig, Amazon Watch&#8217;s program director for Ecuador, and Chrissy Thomure, educational facilities planner, co-teach <em>Climate Change and Justice</em>, which looks at the global and local impacts of climate change, and the strengths and weaknesses of efforts in policy and technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Last year, the course included a video chat with an Ecuadorian leader about climate justice in the Amazon rainforest to help bring more perspectives to the discussion.</p>
<p>Other courses touch on sustainability within the University of California, sustainable leadership, and fostering sustainable behavior.</p>
<p>New this year is <em>Mindfulness and Sustainability</em>, an elective course taught by Jeffrey Kiehl, an adjunct faculty member in Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our communities don&#8217;t often make it easy to make good sustainability decisions,&#8221; Casey said. &#8220;It takes effort on our part and some of that is being mindful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, she noted that climate change stirs up grief in people who understand the scope of its impacts&#8212;and that mindfulness can be a tool to help people cope.</p>
<p>More than 70 people participated in the program last year during its pilot run, and 13 earned a certificate.</p>
<p>Cindy Delgado, assistant director for workers&#8217; compensation, said she enrolled in the program after her office was re-evaluated by the Sustainability Office&#8217;s Green Office Program, earning the highest ranking possible after previously earning the second-highest level.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know about UC Office of the President&#8217;s Carbon Neutrality initiative, and this seemed like the perfect next step,&#8221; Delgado said.</p>
<p>The discussions and activities made each three-hour courses go by quickly, while also leaving her eager to share what she learned with the ten other people in her office.</p>
<p>&#8220;My 'aha moment' was realizing how much additional energy is used to recycle products,&#8221; Delgado said.</p>
<p>That frame of mind has made her think more deeply about the hidden energy costs that are involved with conducting university business&#8212;and approaches that can reduce or eliminate them. Can a meeting be conducted through video chat to avoid people needing to drive to a common location? Does a certain document need to be printed or can it remain a digital version?</p>
<p>&#8220;This program,&#8221; she said, &#8220;has given me a different perspective on how to look at sustainability.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="200d1f44807270175cb4ed6b244544ed"><name>monroe-summer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Aspiring archaeologists get hands-on experience in Haiti, St. Croix</title><summary>J.

<p>It was a 19th-century Danish West Indies coin&#8212;one of the key finds discovered during a four-week field expedition that gave a select group of Howard University undergraduates hands-on archaeology experience.</p>
<p>"I was working some distance from the remains of the slave cabins, sifting by myself, when I found it," recalled Williams. "I didn't know it was a coin, but they were all excited. They told me it was really special."</p>
<p>Williams seems to have a knack: She also found the remains of an 18th-century ceramic tobacco pipe that bore the mark of its Dutch manufacturer.</p>
<p>Williams was one of four Howard students who were part of a unique multi-university expedition funded by the UC Office of the President's <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/uc-hbcu-initiative/index.html">UC-HBCU Initiative</a>, which is building partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Organized by J. Cameron Monroe, associate professor of anthropology, the internship is part of a concerted effort to attract the "best and brightest" prospective graduate students to UC campuses, said Monroe.</p>
<p>"UC really needs these students&#8212;they're bright, socially minded students who are interested in culturally relevant questions," said Monroe, who is involved with several programs focused on <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/05/castro-adobe.html">diversifying the field of archaeology</a>. "They're going to go to graduate school at Harvard, Yale, Princeton&#8212;wherever they want. This is UC's opportunity to try to attract them here."</p>
<p>Williams and her classmates spent four weeks in the field&#8212;two students spent two weeks in Haiti with Monroe before joining their classmates and UC President's Postdoctoral Fellow Justin Dunnavant in St. Croix. The internship included an additional week on campus, where they cataloged and analyzed some 2,000 artifacts they discovered. Each participant left UCSC with an ongoing research project they will pursue this fall.</p>
<p><strong>Field work on a former sugar plantation </strong></p>
<p>Led by Dunnavant, the St. Croix team was charged with doing a "survey" of the Little Princess Estate, which includes the remains of four slave cabins, to determine the density of artifacts. The well-preserved former sugar plantation is now a cultural heritage site managed by the Nature Conservancy; all artifacts will be returned after analysis.</p>
<p>Archaeologists are able to glean incredible insights from bits of pottery, bone, and even seeds that can reveal dietary clues, and Monroe and Dunnavant were pleased by what the sites revealed. For her part, Williams expressed relief that the hours of grueling work in the hot Caribbean sun had yielded some valuable discoveries.</p>
<p>The St. Croix team first had to clear the land, wielding machetes to remove trees and brush from the site, which is about 2.5 acres in total. Jewell Humphrey, an Africana studies major at Howard University, described spending seven hours a day in excavation pits, shoveling dirt, revealing layers, sampling soils, and sifting dirt in search of archaeological treasures. Back in the lab, analysis and cataloging involves counting and sorting the bits of bone, pottery, glass, buttons&#8212;and the prized coin.</p>
<p>"It was all really interesting," recalled Humphrey, sitting in a UCSC lab surrounded by plastic bags filled with artifacts.</p>
<p>Archaeology allows researchers to ask different questions, and it can give voice to those who didn't have access to the historical record, said Dunnavant, the lead researcher on the St. Croix site. "The written history of this plantation was written by slave owners," he said.</p>
<p>The UCSC-led team also worked with members of the local Caribbean Center for Boys and Girls, which is training youth aged 12-18 in archaeological field work, and the University of the Virgin Islands. They were twice featured in on-air interviews with the local radio station, and they attended cultural events, including the island's Emancipation Day celebrations on July 3. They even got a chance to snorkel and scuba dive to introduce them to the skills needed for underwater archaeology. Dunnavant, a certified diver, is a founding member of the Society of Black Archaeologists and part of the Slave Wrecks Project led by the Smithsonian Institution and George Washington University. "The Caribbean gets a lot of hurricanes, so sand is always moving, uncovering and revealing wrecks," he noted.</p>
<p><strong>More work to do</strong></p>
<p>At the end of their week at UC Santa Cruz, the four participating students presented their work and outlined the projects they will pursue this fall. "Their presentations were outstanding," said Monroe. "They were doing first-year graduate level data analysis."</p>
<p>For her part, Humphrey will use the results of this summer's survey to do the initial mapping of artifacts; higher concentrations of artifacts suggests areas of greater daily activity, explained Monroe. "So the team will use those maps next year to determine where they actually dig," he added. Ultimately, the five-year survey will allow researchers to map the entire site in detail, using the location of artifacts to identify cooking areas, trash pits, toilets, and more.</p>
<p>Tia Williams, an aspiring landscape architect, wants to design a walking "heritage tour" of Monroe's research site in Haiti. Tourists are fascinated by the remains of the early 19th century palace, but they lack a systematic way to access information about the site's rich history. Different historic trails would fill that void, and Williams plans to also design a small museum for the palace basement.</p>
<p>"She actually has a chance to get this thing picked up by the Haitian government," said Monroe, who will remain engaged with each student's project.</p>
<p>The Office of the President has renewed funding for the internship for three more years as a Graduate Pathways Grant, and Monroe expressed satisfaction that the program appears to be working: two students from this year's cohort appeared interested in applying to graduate programs at UC Santa Cruz, and another expressed interest in UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>"They had a great time, and we did a good job," said Monroe. "For faculty, the incentive is to attract these bright students. For the university, the incentive is to encourage them to apply to a UC campus. But ultimately, we're helping these students launch their careers. When they apply to graduate school, they're going to get in all over the place. I can't wait to see them with their PhDs teaching at universities all around the country."</p>

<p>AGU Fellows are recognized for their scientific eminence in the Earth and space sciences. Their visionary leadership and scientific excellence have fundamentally advanced research in their respective fields. Only 0.1% of AGU membership receives this recognition in any given year.</p>
<p>Fisher, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has done influential research on groundwater and aquifers, as well as pioneering studies of the flow of water beneath the seafloor. His lab has been implementing and studying groundwater recharge projects in the Pajaro Valley, using available surface waters to replenish depleted aquifers. Fisher is the UCSC campus lead for the <a href="http://ucwater.org/">UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative</a> and coauthored a recent report on <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/groundwater-report.html">sustainable groundwater management</a>.</p>
<p>Paytan, a research professor in the Institute of Marine Sciences, studies chemical and biological processes in the oceans, how they have changed over time, and how they are affected by human activities. Her research includes studies of groundwater discharge into coastal systems, nutrient cycling, ocean acidification, and paleoceanography. Paytan has received the AGU's Dansgaard Award for contributions to paleoceanography and paleoclimatology.</p>
<p>Silver, a professor emeritus of Earth and planetary sciences, is a geophysicist who studies the active processes and mechanisms occurring at the margins of continents, including colliding tectonic plates and their role in mountain building, and mass balance and fluid flow in subduction zones. Silver served as director of the Institute of Tectonics and the Center for Remote Sensing at UC Santa Cruz, and he was part of a team of UCSC scientists who helped establish a national seismographic network in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The new AGU Fellows will be recognized at an honors tribute to be held in December at the AGU's 2018 Fall Meeting in Washington, D.C.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="21a2e1b0807270175cb4ed6b2305120a"><name>humanities-neh-grants</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz awarded two NEH grants for Humanities projects</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has received two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to support humanities projects in the Literature Department.</summary><keywords>2018 NEH grants, Dickens Project, UC Santa Cruz news, UCSC news, UCSC humanities news, ucsc literature news </keywords><start-date>1533869400000</start-date><display-name>Humanities NEH grants  </display-name><path>/2018/08/humanities-neh-grants</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/08/humanities-neh-grants</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1533867646382</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1533870145362</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/bassi-london-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/bassi-london-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bassi-london-400.jpg</name><display-name>bassi-london-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>145789</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz literature professor Karen Bassi</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/neh-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/neh-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>neh-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>neh-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26063</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz literature professor Karen Bassi</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Karen Bassi</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/john-jordan-levels-275.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/john-jordan-levels-275.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>john-jordan-levels-275.jpg</name><display-name>john-jordan-levels-275.jpg</display-name><file-size>82409</file-size><width>275</width><height>346</height></image><image-alt>John Jordan</image-alt><image-caption>John Jordan (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has received two grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to support humanities projects in the Literature Department.</p>
<p>The campus awards are part of $43.1 million in grants for 219 humanities projects nationwide that the NEH has funded this year.</p>
<p>Literature professor Karen Bassi received $200,000 to support a four-week National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Institute for 25 college and university faculty to examine museums as sites of cultural meaning.</p>
<p>Titled "Museums: The Humanities in the Public Sphere," the Institute will be an in-depth exploration of museums and curated cultural collections around Washington, D.C. in 2019</p>
<p>Bassi noted that the the goal of the project is to investigate how museums promote humanistic teaching and research.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Institute will focus on museums as sites for interdisciplinary inquiry into advances in humanistic and scientific research, the effects of ongoing international&#160;conflicts, the speed of evolving technologies, and ethical debates over privacy, sustainability, and cultural heritage,&#8221; said Bassi.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Institute is guided by the principle that museums offer windows on the educational, ethical, and cultural debates that define the humanities today,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Four major museums will serve as case studies--the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Freer-Sackler Museums of Asian Art.</p>
<p>Bassi will co-direct the project with Gretchen Henderson, a 2018 Tanner Fellow in environmental humanities at the University of Utah, lecturer at Georgetown University, and research associate at UC Santa Cruz. The Institute builds on a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2014/07/greece-bassi-institute.html"><strong><em>previous NEH Summer Institute led by Bassi</em></strong></a> in 2014 in Athens, Greece, in which Henderson was a participant.</p>
<p>Bassi earned her B.A in Classics from UC Santa Cruz in 1980 and her Ph.D. in Classics from Brown University in 1987. She has taught at UCSC since 1989 and also served as chair of the Literature Department, director of the Classics program, and director of the Educational Abroad Program in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Her latest book is <em>Traces of the Past: Classics between History and Archaeology </em>(University of Michigan Press 2016). She recently received a $42,000 NEH fellowship for the 2017-18 academic year to support research and writing leading to the publication of a new book on attitudes toward death in ancient Greek tragic drama.</p>
<p><strong>Director and co-founder of the Dickens Project</strong> John Jordan received a $94,143 NEH grant to support a three-week seminar for 16 school teachers on adaptations of literary works.</p>
<p>Titled &#8220;Reimagining the Literary Classic: Teaching Literature through Adaptations,&#8221; the three-week seminar for middle and high school teachers will use two case studies, <em>Jane Eyre </em>and <em>Great Expectations</em>, to show teachers how they can use literary adaptations to connect the study of literature with the development of their students&#8217; core skills--including critical reading, analytical reasoning, argumentative writing, and creative production.</p>
<p>The seminar will be hosted by the Dickens Project at UC Santa Cruz and take place in July of 2019 so participants may take advantage of the Dickens Universe, the annual week-long gathering for scholars, teachers, and Dickens enthusiasts from around the world, which begins immediately following the end of the seminar.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is one of several NEH grants for teachers that the Dickens Project has received,&#8221; noted Jordan. &#8220;These summer seminars demonstrate the Project's commitment to promoting the teaching of nineteenth-century literature, including Dickens, in high schools across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earlier this summer, we sponsored a very successful seminar on the topic "Why Literature Matters," Jordan added. &#8220;All of this is part of the Dickens Project's larger mission of public humanities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jordan is the principal investigator on the grant and the seminar will be led by Professor Marty Gould, associate professor of English at the University of South Florida, who has led previous Dickens Project seminars sponsored by the NEH at UC Santa Cruz in the past.</p>

<p>Chimpanzees inhabit both rainforests and savannah regions of Africa, and their diets vary accordingly. Forest dwelling chimpanzees mostly feed on ripe fruits commonly considered easy to process, while savannah chimpanzees include more challenging non-fruit items into their diet.</p>
<p><a href="https://anthro.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/VIcky_Oelze.html">Vicky Oelze</a>, an assistant professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, participated in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-018-0115-6">new study</a> led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig that analyzed the mechanical properties and the isotopic composition of plant foods eaten by chimpanzees living in the tropical forest and savannah woodland.</p>
<p>They found that the savannah chimpanzees eat foods that are more mechanically challenging and therefore may place higher selective pressures on their chewing apparatus compared to their counterparts living in the rainforest. Since early hominins likely evolved in an environment similar to that of today&#8217;s savannah woodland chimpanzees, early human ancestors may have encountered similarly challenging foods.</p>
<p>"If we better understand the foundations and interactions of food material properties, dental wear processes, and isotopes in modern chimpanzees, it opens a window into the past and helps to interpret the data obtained from fossil specimens who lived in the African savannah several million years ago," explained Oelze, a guest researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, who conducted the stable isotope analysis while she was a postdoctoral researcher there. Oelze's research focuses on primate ecology, prehistoric diets, and the feeding ecology of great apes.</p>
<p>Savannah chimpanzees are thought to rely on non-fruit resources more than their forest counterparts. The mechanical properties of plant foods can vary substantially but until this study, there had been no comparative data available for chimpanzee populations living in distinct habitat types.</p>
<p>Adam van Casteren of the Max Planck Weizmann Center for Integrative Archaeology and Anthropology at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology compared the material properties of various plant foods eaten by chimpanzees in a tropical rainforest in Uganda and a savannah woodland in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Using a portable mechanical tester, he measured the physical properties of plant tissues and found that some plant parts from the mosaic savannah woodland habitat, such as the outer casing of the <em>Strychnos</em> fruit, had much higher toughness and stiffness values than the plant tissues he tested from the rainforest.</p>
<p>"I was surprised to see that some values even exceed those recorded for orangutan foods, as they are generally considered to consume the most mechanically challenging diet of all the great apes," said van Casteren.</p>
<p>The scientists combined their plant food mechanical data with data from a stable isotope analysis from both plant and chimpanzee hair samples. Carbon stable isotopes are commonly used to reconstruct dietary ecology and habitat use of living and extinct primates. Dental morphology, food mechanical properties and carbon stable isotopes are all highly relevant for reconstructing past diets of early human ancestors in Africa.</p>
<p>Although the carbon isotope values of plants were remarkably similar in both habitats, the isotope data obtained from chimpanzee hair suggested that savannah chimpanzees frequently feed on plants growing in open canopy areas. These likely include plants that are particularly demanding when processed with the teeth. The authors believe that the consumption of such tough foods is facilitated by the large front teeth of chimpanzees.</p>
<p>"While some chimpanzee populations are using tools to crack open nuts, others like these savannah chimpanzees still rely on their teeth to get access to nutrients," said Kornelius Kupczik, co-author and Track Leader of the Max Planck Weizmann Center. "Such differences in selection pressures acting on the teeth are likely to have played a key role during the evolution of hominins."</p>

<p>An interdisciplinary scholar of visual culture, Murray is an associate professor of film and digital media who is also affiliated with the Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. program--as well as the Art and Design: Games and Playable Media B.A. program--in the UC Santa Cruz Arts Division.</p>
<p><em>On Video Games</em> critically examines blockbuster games such as <em>The Last of Us, Metal Gear Solid, Spec Ops: The Line, Tomb Raider</em> and <em>Assassin's Creed</em> to show how&#160;they are profoundly intertwined with American ideological positions and current political, economic, and cultural&#160;conflicts.</p>
<p>In a world where profits from the gaming industry now surpass revenues from the film industry worldwide, Murray looks at how video games both reflect and provoke societal fears, hopes, and dreams, as well as complicated struggles for identity and recognition.</p>
<p>She also explores how video games are at the cutting-edge of power relations, helping to shape opinions and evoke emotion, much like film and music.&#160;</p>
<p>I recently spoke with Murray about <em>On Video Games: The Visual Politics of Race, Gender and Space</em><em>:</em></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. What inspired you to write this book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Video games are a massive global industry and highly influential forms of visual culture like film and television. Yet the public discourse around them is incredibly limited. Mostly, it consists of moral panics around whether video games make you violent, and they are thought of as beneath serious consideration. I have been startled by the degree to which scholars who are committed to visual studies have largely been neglecting games, despite their obvious reach and significance. As someone with in-depth training in visual studies, and who grew up playing games, I am well positioned to innovate ways of understanding video games as forms of &#8220;playable&#8221; visual culture.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can you give some examples of how blockbuster video games are deeply entangled with contemporary political, cultural, and economic conflicts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> When I say that games are &#8220;political&#8221; or &#8220;cultural&#8221;, I do not mean that games engage directly with the political process, or that they present themselves in the same mode as other cultural forms like art, music or theater. But they do create playable scenarios that may engage with political subject matter, and respond to political or cultural realities in a topical way&#8212;with varying degrees of responsibility. Games exist in social, cultural and political moments. They respond to their moment, presenting particular worldviews and value systems. In engaging with these games, we may adopt, contest or reject the visions they propose.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <strong>Can you also give examples of how mainstream games both reflect and create larger societal fears, hopes, dreams, and struggles for recognition?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> In my book, I talk about <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em>, which is partially set in 1980s Soviet-controlled Afghanistan. It struck me as no accident that the &#8220;background&#8221; of this hyper-macho military-themed action-adventure game was the very site where the Taliban came into being&#8212;and eventually al-Qaeda. It taps into notions of the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; and the &#8220;axis of evil&#8221; in ways that prick the player, even if they are not specifically aware of how the game is working on them.</p>
<p>More recently, there have been some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/20/17480666/video-games-companies-lying-politics">pointed discussions about the use of political content</a> in mainstream games like <em>Detroit: Become Human </em>(which invokes race-based social justice via androids),<em> Far Cry </em>5 (which indirectly deals with Brexit and the 2014 Bundy standoff) and the forthcoming<em> Tom Clancy&#8217;s The Division 2 (</em>set in Washington D.C. and featuring themes of saving the US from tyranny). One of the major contributions of my book is a chapter that ultimately forecasted the rise of the alt-right in its struggle toward recognition, by analyzing the turn toward representations of victimized or disadvantaged white male protagonists in the Obama era and after.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong><strong>How are games at the frontline of power relations? &#160;And how might we deal with this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Video games can shape hearts and minds the same way that music and cinema can respond to politics and capture a certain feeling, stoking fervor or invoking protest. Games can be incredibly persuasive rhetorical devices. In the same way that political ignorance is an impediment for democracy to function well, the lack of a mature critical studies apparatus allows a lot of shabby ideas to fester in video games under the guise that games are an apolitical place for &#8220;fun&#8221;.</p>
<p>The more we understand that, as play scholar Miguel Sicart says, games are ethical objects and players are ethical agents, the better we will become at creating a critical studies of games that can struggle with the medium in a constructive way. One of the unique aspects of UCSC&#8217;s games program is its commitment to these ideas.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <strong>What is the most important thing you hope that people learn from this book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> For other games scholars interested in talking about games from a visual studies or cultural studies perspective, this book can be useful for understanding the stakes involved, the necessity for such analyses, and model some possible examples.</p>
<p>For everyone else, realize that video games are global mass culture, far larger than television and film and the music industry, and yet video games have been operating with comparatively little of the critical apparatus these other forms have. Video games are machines for thinking. I want people to be aware of this and have the tools to decide for themselves what kinds of thinking machines they want to play with, rather than the opposite scenario, where the games are simply working on them.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Ben Storm studies memory, so it's fortunate that he's pretty quick to learn the names of students in his psychology classes each quarter. But it turns out he's also good at forgetting.</p>
<p>According to Storm, our ability to remember is closely linked to our ability to forget.</p>
<p>"Our memory system is <em>designed </em>to make things inaccessible," said Storm. "It's adaptive, not a failure."</p>
<p>That message&#8212;likely welcome news for many&#8212;is just one of many insights about memory shared by Storm, an associate professor of psychology who is fascinated by how memory supports thinking, learning, and creativity.</p>
<p>As a graduate student at UCLA, Storm was drawn to what psychologists call "retrieval-induced forgetting." The vast majority of memory research is based on experiments that test a participant's ability to "study and retrieve" a list of words. Basically, Storm explained, subjects are given a list of words to remember, then asked to recall them. The act of retrieving some words actually makes people forget the others. This phenomenon&#8212;"retrieval-induced forgetting"&#8212;was identified well before researchers understood the mechanism that causes it.</p>
<p>"Forgetting is part of learning and remembering," said Storm. "Our memory system pushes away some things in an attempt to remember other things. The system is designed to prevent what we call 'non-target information' from interfering with the retrieval of target information."</p>
<p>Which also explains why, when you're trying hard to remember to pick up milk and eggs at the grocery store, you forget to buy bread.</p>
<p>It's not that our memories are finite, like a computer hard drive that reaches capacity and can't accommodate any more data. "Storage strength is effectively infinite. It's retrieval that's difficult," said Storm. "Retrieval is severely limited&#8212;which is why forgetting helps."</p>
<p><strong>Memory is fabulous&#8212;and fallible</strong></p>
<p>Storm is interested in how <em>context </em>influences memory&#8212;psychological and social processes that affect recall. "Once you learn something, even if it's been years, you're going to relearn it faster the second time around," he said. "And you might be able to retrieve it faster if you're given the right cue."</p>
<p>Cues are environmental factors, including your thoughts, mood, the company you're in&#8212;even questions on a test. "Cues are incredibly important for retrieval and access," he said. "Cues determine what you can remember at a given point of time."</p>
<p>Memories, of course, are susceptible to change. Every time we call up a memory, it becomes susceptible to modification. Lab experiments indicate that this mechanism operates regardless of content; happy, sad, boring, and traumatic memories, for example, can all be changed as a consequence of retrieval.</p>
<p>"Memory wasn't designed to be perfect," said Storm. "It was designed to inform our behaviors." Memory allows us to rely on short cuts and "rule of thumb" ways of thinking&#8212;even gut feelings, he noted.</p>
<p><strong>Does technology help or hurt?</strong></p>
<p>On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the founding of Google, Storm is acutely aware that very few people under the age of 30 remember life without the internet. What impact does technology have on memory and how we learn?</p>
<p>"Humans are no longer alone," he said. "We now remember in concert with devices."</p>
<p>That relationship, however, is complex and full of surprises, as Storm and his graduate students are discovering.</p>
<p>For a generation that's obsessed with taking photos to document and "remember" every aspect of their lives, doctoral student Julia Soares's research may be disappointing: Her <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/06/soares-memory.html">recent study</a> produced compelling evidence that taking photographs impairs&#8212;rather than improves&#8212;people's memories of events.</p>
<p>Storm's <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/storm-memory.html">research</a> also suggests that relying on the internet to access information can actually diminish the learning experience. It can make taking in new information so easy that it skips the cognitive process of developing and refining "schemas," which is the brain's way of organizing information.</p>
<p>"Once you get used to using Google, you retrieve information from your own memory less often, which robs yourself of an important learning experience," he said. "You lose the opportunity to create deeper, higher-level learning structures."</p>
<p>Human cognition and memory are complicated, intertwined processes that involve putting information together, integrating it, and coming up with new ideas. "Creating new ideas," mused Storm. "Isn't that one of our goals as educators?"</p>
<p><strong>Feeling nervous is a valuable aspect of learning </strong></p>
<p>As a professor and a memory researcher, Storm has some doubts about the efficacy of common educational strategies. Learning involves more than memorizing facts, he says. Real learning is about discovering a passion for knowledge, and helping students take new information and connect it to things they care about.</p>
<p>"We like to make students feel learning is easy," he said. "But they're likely being fooled, because they may not be engaging in the type of processes that create deep or meaningful learning."</p>
<p>A lot of teaching and learning strategies focus on helping students prepare to do well on tests&#8212;even if they will forget the material the next day. Deep learning requires interaction. Students who feel uncertain about material actually remember more, because they are forced to engage more deeply, generate new ideas, and make connections to resolve that uncertainty. This process embeds new material within one's knowledge structures, or schemas. Without it, learning can be superficial.</p>
<p>"Students who don't like to be challenged, who want it to feel easy, may not be learning as much," said Storm, who tries "within reason" to develop and utilize instructional strategies built around these insights.</p>
<p>"Students need to buy in, so I explain it to them," he said. "Quizzes and assignments can be designed to make students retrieve information, to think and connect to their knowledge and their interests. It's not about making learning difficult for the sake of making it difficult, it's about making it challenging and enjoyable, so it feels rewarding. When they're engaged, it's like tricking them into learning better than they would have."</p>
<p>One of the study tips Storm offers students is to "do something different," because processing information in new and different ways helps learning. Rather than take a practice test, he suggests, create practice tests and share them with classmates. If you rely on highlighting material to study, try studying without it. (Storm described a memory study that examined the value of highlighting. Researchers found it can be helpful&#8212;<em>particularly </em>for those who hate to highlight: "Their benefit was enormous," he said.)</p>
<p>Storm expressed some frustration with what he considers an overemphasis on innate differences in learning. "What makes me sad is all the talk about limited capacity," he said. "That's not right. That's not understanding how learning and cognition works. And it becomes self-limiting. It has an effect on students. We all have an incredible power to learn."</p>
<p><strong>Memory and creativity: The riddle of the absentminded professor</strong></p>
<p>If "cues" are essential to our ability to retrieve memories, "blockers" cause mental fixations that get in the way of creativity. Forgetting, it turns out, can help bust blockers&#8212;which means forgetting is critical to the creative process, too.</p>
<p>"Forgetting allows us to think outside the box," said Storm.</p>
<p>Researchers have tested this process in the lab by giving subjects an everyday object, like a paper clip, and asking them to come up with novel uses. Researchers present a few examples of creative uses and then ask subjects to list as many new ideas as they can in two minutes. "The extent to which the subject forgets the examples they're given correlates with their creativity," said Storm. "If they fixate on the examples, they can't come up with their own new ideas."</p>
<p>This process explains why it's helpful to take a break when you feel stymied by a problem or creative challenge. "You can take advantage of it by going for a run or thinking about something else," said Storm. "When you take you mind off something it can seem counterproductive, but you're actually better off."</p>
<p>This is an example of what Storm calls the "adaptive nature of forgetting." If you focus on the old way of thinking, you're not going to "make the jump," he said.</p>
<p>For Storm, the pursuit of multiple aspects of memory research is challenging, engaging, and also a bit hectic.</p>
<p>"It would be easier to have one niche than to try to make connections between different areas," he said. "But I find so many things interesting. I can't leave any of them behind."</p>

Other Victorian novelists have fallen into the dustbin of obscurity, but Dickens, with his rich, heartbreaking, and sometimes hilarious language; his keen eye for character and dialogue; his love of story; his sense of injustice; and his skewering of hypocrisy and bureaucracy, will never go out of style. </span></p>

Unlike Ms. Trump&#8217;s mother, my father was an economic migrant, too poor to qualify for even the most basic visa requirements. He was a maintenance worker with a third-grade education, and the only way to give his children a better future was to break the law.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Now a U.S. citizen</strong>, Grande grew up in extreme poverty&#160;in rural Mexico. She was only two when her father left Mexico to look for work in the U.S. Her mother followed two years later, leaving Grande behind in Mexico. In 1985, when she was almost 10, Grande crossed the border as an undocumented immigrant.<br/><br/>Overcoming the language barrier and her status as an undocumented immigrant in the United States, Grande made the most of her new home, eventually earning a bachelor's degree in creative writing/film &amp; video from UC Santa Cruz in 1999. For her senior project in UCSC's Literature Department, she even wrote the first 80 pages of her debut novel,&#160;<em>Across a Hundred Mountains</em>.<br/><br/>&#8220;I identify so much with young undocumented child immigrants because I came to the U.S. as one myself,&#8221; Grande told me in a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/reyna-grande.html"><strong><em>2012 interview</em></strong></a>. &#8220;I also spent years worrying about my legal status, fearing deportation. But I came to the U.S. at a time when something wonderful happened--the amnesty of 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which allowed almost 3 million people, including both my parents, to legalize their status.&#8221;&#8232;&#8232;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I got my green card I felt the whole world open up to me,&#8221; she added. &#8220;And now I am paying back everything this country has given me, and I will continue to do so until the day I die.&#8221;<br/><br/>Grande is currently the author of three critically acclaimed books. Her last one, <em>The Distance Between Us</em>, was a memoir about her life before and after illegally immigrating from Mexico to the United States. A finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, it was described by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> as &#8220;a brutally honest book&#8230;the Angela&#8217;s Ashes of the modern Mexican immigrant experience.&#8221;<br/><br/>At the time it was published, the <em>Washington Independent Review of Books</em> noted that &#8220;This book would be fabulous required reading for college freshmen&#8212;or even better, for members of Congress.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Grande&#8217;s upcoming book</strong>, <em>A Dream Called Home</em>, is set to be published on October 2. A sequel to <em>The Distance Between Us</em>, her new book begins where her last book left off&#8212;at her arrival at UC Santa Cruz, where she began her quest to become the first person in her family to earn a university degree and to become a writer. <br/><br/>Grande will celebrate the publication date on October 2 with a book launch in Santa Cruz. She will discuss her new memoir in a conversation with UC Santa Cruz literature professor Micah Perks, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Peace United Church (900 High Street). <br/><br/>Presented by Bookshop Santa Cruz and The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz, <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/reyna-grande-book-launch-dream-called-home/"><em><strong>the event is free and open to the public</strong></em></a>. Free copies of the new book will also be available to the first 50 students (with student ID) at the door.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/grande-second-novel.html</url><title>Award-winning UCSC alumna gaining recognition for second novel</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5db86b76807270177653ce780cf846fd"><name>expect-minor-campus-disruptions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Expect minor campus disruptions Aug 23 to Sept. 17</title><summary>Contract work taking place across main campus Aug. 23 to Sept. 17 may cause minor disruptions for motorists, bus riders, pedestrians, and diners.</summary><author> v</author><description>Contract work taking place across main campus Aug. 23 to Sept. 17 may cause minor disruptions for motorists, bus riders, pedestrians, and diners.</description><start-date>1534834800000</start-date><display-name>Expect minor campus disruptions Aug 23 to Sept. 17</display-name><path>/2018/08/expect-minor-campus-disruptions</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/08/expect-minor-campus-disruptions</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1534875691847</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1534876157514</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Campus Updates</value><value>Administrative Message</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contract work taking place across main campus Aug. 23 to Sept. 17 may cause minor disruptions for motorists, bus riders, pedestrians, and diners.</span></p>

<p>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz compiled and analyzed data from around the world for earthquakes clearly associated with injection wells. They found that a single injection well can cause earthquakes at distances more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the well. They also found that, in general, injecting fluids into sedimentary rock can cause larger, more distant earthquakes than injecting into the underlying basement rock.</p>
<p>"This is problematic, since the current advice is to preferentially inject into the sedimentary sequence as a theoretically safer alternative to the basement rock," said Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Postdoctoral researcher Thomas Goebel said the key issue is the spatial footprint of induced seismicity around the injection well. "It's not that the basement rock is safe, because there is still the possibility of encountering a fault in the basement rock that can cause a large earthquake, but the probability is reduced because the spatial footprint is smaller," he said.</p>
<p>In a paper published August 31 in <em>Science</em>, Goebel and Brodsky described two distinct patterns of induced seismicity, which they associated with different physical mechanisms acting in basement rock and sedimentary rock. In the first pattern, associated with injection into basement rock, earthquakes tend to occur in a compact cluster around the well, with a steep decline in earthquakes farther from the well. In the other pattern, associated with sedimentary rock, induced earthquakes decline gradually with distance from the well and occur at much greater distances.</p>
<p>The physical mechanism by which injection wells induce earthquakes was thought to be a direct result of increased fluid pressure in the pores of the rock, causing faults to slip more easily. This mechanism can account for the spatial pattern of seismicity seen with injection into basement rock, Goebel said. But the pattern seen with injection into sedimentary rock suggests a different mechanism resulting from efficient "poroelastic coupling," which controls the ability of the rock to transmit fluid stresses into the solid rock matrix.</p>
<p>"When you inject water into the ground, it pushes on the surrounding rock and creates elastic stress in the rock, which can put pressure on faults at a distance without putting water into those faults. So if poroelasticity is dominant, you end up with a larger footprint because it's loading neighboring faults beyond the area of increased pore pressure," Brodsky said.</p>
<p>According to Goebel, the crystalline basement rock is stiffer and has lower porosity than sedimentary rock. "Therefore, the increase in pore pressure is limited to isolated pockets around the well, and the coupling of that with the overall stress field is low," he said.</p>
<p>Goebel said their findings help explain the extent of induced seismicity in regions such as Oklahoma where there are many injection sites in oil and gas fields. Oklahoma has seen a dramatic surge in earthquakes since 2010, to the extent that there are now more earthquakes each year in Oklahoma than in California. Goebel and Brodsky did not include sites in Oklahoma in their study, however, because there are so many injection wells they couldn't isolate the effects of individual wells.</p>
<p>"In Oklahoma, they are injecting into the high-porosity sedimentary unit above the basement, but these elastic stresses can be transmitted over a large distance, so you could activate a large basement fault at a distance of 10 kilometers," Goebel said. "That may be what we're seeing in places like Oklahoma."</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been a grueling 17 weeks of training, but Caroline Carpenter was on track to graduate from the Los Angeles Fire Department Academy&#8212;what recruits call &#8220;the Drill Tower&#8221;&#8212;when the unthinkable happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2013 Cowell College classical studies graduate had gotten high marks on skills like setting up 186-pound ladders and chopping holes into smoldering roofs when it came time for her last test. She was supposed to cut her way into a building using a heavy rotary saw. She fired up the tool and began to cut, realizing seconds into the maneuver that she&#8217;d forgotten to put on her safety glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly slipped on the protective eyewear but it wasn&#8217;t enough for the pass/fail test. She was kicked out of the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was literally the very last thing I could have done to fail out of the Tower,&#8221; says the 27-year-old from her home in Seal Beach, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Carpenter was nothing if not tough. The same day she learned her fate, she got in her car and drove for an hour to another Drill Tower being held by the LA Fire Department and, after 20 more exhausting weeks there, she made history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She became the first woman to graduate at the top of the Los Angeles Fire Department Academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think a lot of people have done 37 continuous weeks in the Tower,&#8221; Carpenter says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpenter grew up in Long Beach, the athletic daughter of two educators, and decided UC Santa Cruz with its ocean, forests, and rigorous classical studies program was for her. She joined the swim team, dove into her studies, and planned to go to graduate school. She was traveling along her life&#8217;s road map&#8212;until her senior year, when she discovered she was pregnant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was able to graduate a few months early and moved to Southern California, where her baby&#8217;s father lived. There, she gave birth to a son they named Charles Dewitt Carpenter-Castillo but who everyone simply calls Dewey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took care of her baby and her elderly grandfather, then worked as a seasonal lifeguard and as a teacher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everybody wants me to say that I wanted to be a firefighter since I was a child, but that&#8217;s not true,&#8221; Carpenter says. &#8220;I decided firefighting was a good way to make it work down here for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everybody believed she could do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of doubters thought a 5-foot-5, 130-pound, vegan woman wouldn&#8217;t survive the physically and emotionally tough Drill Tower to become a firefighter. In fact, many women don&#8217;t. Out of about 3,000 LA firefighters, only about 3 percent are women, although the department has pledged to raise that number to 5 percent in the next two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the naysayers didn&#8217;t count on Carpenter&#8217;s determination and grit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The mentality I have when I&#8217;m doing something hard is, &#8216;Yeah, I can do this. It&#8217;s going to be a lot of work and it&#8217;s going to suck at times and my body is going to hurt and I&#8217;m going to be mentally fatigued, but I can do it,&#8217;&#8221; Carpenter says. &#8220;That mentality has carried me through a lot of things I&#8217;ve done in my life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpenter began a regimen of weightlifting and muscle building in addition to her running, cycling, and surfing. Once accepted into the Drill Tower, that fitness paid off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She ran sprints up seven flights of stairs, did endless squats and pushups, and hauled ladders that weighed 50 more pounds than she did. Then came the mistake, and Carpenter had to start all over again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My body was pretty wrecked by the time I left the first Tower and entered the second,&#8221; she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Carpenter kept at it and nabbed the top recruit spot with her skills and high scores&#8212;the first female to achieve that feat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Caroline really represents what we are all about,&#8221; says Graham Everett, chief of staff for the Los Angeles Fire Department, which covers 469 square miles of territory. &#8220;Her resiliency and desire to come back and then outshine everyone is truly a testament to her commitment to sacrifice and to putting in the effort, and also sets an example for more women to go into the fire service.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now serving a one-year probationary period as a firefighter, Carpenter is still garnering praise from her superiors and colleagues, according to Everett.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Carpenter&#8217;s very first day on the job turned out to be a test of all her skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called out for a fully involved structure fire, firefighters including Carpenter had to kick their way into the burning building after their rotary saw broke. Once inside, a section of ceiling fell onto Carpenter and a fellow firefighter and entangled them in a mess of wires as the fire raged and a call came in that part of the roof had collapsed. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpenter and her colleague managed to cut their way out of the wires and escape the building moments before its fa&#231;ade also crumbled and fell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Firefighting is inherently dangerous,&#8221; Carpenter says, &#8220;but to have experienced what I did that first day was pretty awesome and rewarding, and I learned a lot. I feel fortunate to be around a lot of people who are teaching me good habits.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Everett: &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for great things from her.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7e0921b6807270177653ce7838a287e4"><name>taylor-sffilm-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Film professor Jennifer Taylor wins grant from the SFFILM 2018 Documentary Film Fund</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz associate professor of film and digital media Jennifer Maytorena Taylor has received a grant from the SFFILM Documentary Film Fund to support her latest project, "The Gut."</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, ucsc film news, jennifer taylor, ucsc arts division news</keywords><start-date>1535419200000</start-date><display-name> Jennifer Taylor grant from SFFILM </display-name><path>/2018/08/taylor-sffilm-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/08/taylor-sffilm-grant</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1535417851312</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1535420110538</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/taylor-headshot-2018-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/taylor-headshot-2018-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>taylor-headshot-2018-250.jpg</name><display-name>taylor-headshot-2018-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>111384</file-size><width>250</width><height>375</height></image><image-alt>Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Film and Digital Media</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/08/images/taylor-headshopt-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/08/images/taylor-headshopt-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>taylor-headshopt-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>taylor-headshopt-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27689</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Film and Digital Media</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of Film and Digital Media</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz associate professor of film and digital media Jennifer Maytorena Taylor has received a grant from the <a href="https://www.sffilm.org"><em><strong>SFFILM</strong></em></a> Documentary Film Fund to support her latest project, "The Gut."</p>
<p>The $25,000 grant is designed to support documentary films already in post-production to push them towards completion.</p>
<p>In addition to the cash prize, Taylor will have access to benefits through&#160;SFFILM Makers--the organization&#8217;s artist development program--that can include one-on-one project consultations, creative development, additional fundraising assistance, resource and service recommendations, and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>Taylor will use her grant to support post-production costs for her documentary, &#8220;The Gut.&#8221; Set in Rutland, Vermont, a small blue-collar city recovering from an opioid epidemic, the film follows Mayor Louras and a small ensemble of intersecting characters for two years as he fights to resettle Syrian refugees in the town.&#160;</p>
<p>The documentary explores the different perspectives on the many complex issues facing residents, such as community transitions, economic growth, and change when small-town America meets the Syrian civil war.</p>
<p>Earlier this spring, Taylor, received a fellowship for a 2018 summer residency to work on her film at the&#160;MacDowell Colony, one of the nation&#8217;s leading contemporary arts organizations, in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Since it was created in 2011, the&#160;SFFILM Documentary Film Fund has&#160;given more than $750,000 to filmmakers across the country.</p>
<p>Past recipients include&#160;RaMell Ross&#8217; Sundance Jury Prize-winner&#160;<em>Hale County,&#160;This Morning, This Evening</em>;&#160;Peter Nicks&#8217; Sundance Directing Award-winner&#160;<em>The Force</em>;&#160;Peter Bratt&#8217;s SFFILM Audience Award-winner&#160;<em>Dolores</em>; and&#160;Zachary Heinzerling&#8216;s SFFILM Audience Award-winner and Academy Award-nominee&#160;<em>Cutie and the Boxer</em>.</p>
<p>Taylor&#8217;s previous films include the 2015 film&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/10/carmel-festival-documentary.html"><em><strong>Daisy &amp; Max</strong></em></a>, an hour-long documentary, filmed on location in South Los Angeles, about a couple working to protect LA communities from gang violence that is caught in the crossfire of the U.S. war on gangs.</p>
<p>She also produced one of several short pieces that comprised&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/taylor-pbs-race.html"><em><strong>The Talk: Race in America</strong></em></a>, a new film that premiered on&#160;PBS in 2017.</p>
<p>Taylor&#8217;s most recent project, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/07/redneck-muslim-film.html"><em><strong>Redneck Muslim</strong></em></a>, was one of 25 films featured this summer in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/filmfestival/2018-festival/redneck-muslim/"><em><strong>2018 PBS Online Film Festival</strong></em></a> as a presentation of the PBS series <em>POV</em>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="812fa1b0807270177653ce788010e9b2"><name>renting-room-to-a-student</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renting a room to a student</title><summary>Offering a room in your home to a student who has not been able to find housing for the school year would be a tremendous support to their success at UCSC.</summary><start-date>1535410800000</start-date><display-name>Renting a room to a student</display-name><path>/2018/08/renting-room-to-a-student</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/08/renting-room-to-a-student</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1535470707087</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1535470990384</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear faculty and staff,</p>
<p>As you no doubt know, there is a significant housing crisis in Santa Cruz, and I am writing to you today to see if you may be able to help us address it by offering a room for rent in your home to a UCSC student this fall. We currently have several hundred students without housing guarantees on the waiting list for housing, and not nearly enough rentals offered in our available <a href="https://communityrentals.ucsc.edu/">Community Rentals</a> listings to accommodate these students.</p>
<p>You may wish to consider offering rental housing in your home for the academic year, or perhaps for a shorter period. It is possible to identify a student who just needs a place to stay until housing becomes available on campus. We have on campus spaces open up when students graduate after fall or winter quarter, or otherwise depart the university.</p>
<p>The need is real and it is urgent, so I am reaching out to the faculty and staff community for help. Offering a room in your home to a student who has not been able to find housing for the school year would be a tremendous support to their success at UCSC.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://communityrentals.ucsc.edu/">Community Rentals Office</a> located in room 104 at the Hahn Student Services Building is standing by to assist you in getting your listing posted, and to support you in any other way in this process.

This is predicted to be the most common way for Higgs bosons to decay, yet it was a difficult signal to isolate because it closely mimics ordinary background processes.</p>
<p>The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012 confirmed the existence of the Higgs field, which gives elementary particles mass. It is a fundamental part of the standard model of particle physics. The new finding is important because it opens up the possibility for scientists to closely examine the behavior of the Higgs boson, such as whether it could interact with new, undiscovered particles.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our main goals is to measure the Higgs decay rates, and the dominant Higgs decay is this bottom-quark channel. About 60 percent of Higgs bosons should decay into bottom quarks,&#8221; said Jason Nielsen, professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz and associate director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). &#8220;If we measure all the predicted ways the Higgs can decay and they don't sum up to 100 percent, it could mean there is something else coupling to the Higgs, like dark matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The detection of the Higgs-to-bottom-quarks decay was announced jointly by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN, the European particle physics lab in Geneva, Switzerland, where the LHC is located. After several years of refining their techniques and gradually incorporating more data, both experiments finally saw evidence of the Higgs decaying to bottom quarks that exceeds the 5-sigma threshold of statistical significance typically required to claim a discovery. Both teams found their results were consistent with predictions based on the standard model.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz physicists have been at the forefront of U.S. participation in the LHC and the ATLAS collaboration. Marco Battaglia, a SCIPP research professor who is currently at CERN, led the large ATLAS group that developed the algorithms for identifying bottom quarks. Nielsen and several UCSC graduate students and postdoctoral researchers were also directly involved in the new discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our group had been working on the analyses of the data from the ATLAS experiment, looking for evidence of Higgs decays, and we developed a new data analysis that was part of the combination that pushed us over the 5-sigma threshold,&#8221; Nielsen said. &#8220;We are also using the Higgs-to-bottom-quarks decay as a way of looking for new particles.&#8221;</p>
<p>A paper on the new data analysis has been accepted for publication in <em>Physical Review D</em>.</p>
<p>Higgs bosons are only produced in roughly one out of a billion LHC collisions and live only one-septillionth of a second before their energy is converted into a cascade of other particles. Because it&#8217;s impossible to see Higgs bosons directly, scientists use these secondary particles to study the Higgs&#8217; properties. Since its discovery in 2012, scientists have been able to identify only about 30 percent of all the predicted Higgs boson decays.</p>
<p>The Higgs field is theorized to interact with all massive particles in the standard model, the best theory scientists have to explain the behavior of subatomic particles. But many scientists suspect that the Higgs could also interact with massive particles outside the standard model, such as dark matter. By finding and mapping the Higgs bosons&#8217; interactions with known particles, scientists can simultaneously probe for new phenomena.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fraction of Higgs bosons could be producing dark matter particles as part of their decay,&#8221; said Giacinto Piacquadio, a physicist at Stony Brook University who co-leads the Higgs-to-bottom-quarks analysis group. &#8220;Because the decay of the Higgs boson to bottom quarks is so common, we can use it to put constraints on potentially invisible decays as well as use it to probe for new physics directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though this decay is the most popular path, spotting it in the experimental data was no walk in the park. Every proton-proton collision produces a splattering of subatomic byproducts, one of the most common being bottom quarks. These bottom quarks then quickly decay into other kinds of particles, leaving behind vast showers of particles in the detectors. Tracing these particle showers back to two bottom quarks (and then figuring out which ones came from a Higgs boson) is extremely delicate and labyrinthine work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being able to identify and isolate bottom quarks in the experimental data is a huge challenge and required precise detector calibration and sophisticated b-quark tagging,&#8221; said Piacquadio. &#8220;We were only able to do these analyses thanks to years of work that came before.&#8221;</p>
<p>To spot this process, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations each combined data from the first and second runs of the LHC and then applied complex analysis methods to the data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding just one event that looks like two bottom quarks originating from a Higgs boson is not enough,&#8221; said Chris Palmer, a scientist at Princeton University who worked on the CMS analysis. &#8220;We needed to analyze hundred of thousands of events before we could illuminate this process, which is happening on top of a mountain of similar-looking background events.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Palmer, these deceptive background events made the analyses almost impossible to perform based on isolated bottom quarks alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily, there are a few Higgs production mechanisms that produce identifiable particles as byproducts,&#8221; said Palmer. &#8220;We used these particles to tag potential Higgs events and separate them out from everything else. So we really got a two-for-one deal with this analysis because not only did we find the Higgs decaying to bottom quarks, but we also learned a lot about its production mechanisms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next step is to increase the precision of these measurements so that scientists can study this decay mode with a much greater resolution and explore what secrets the Higgs boson might be hiding.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8138bffb807270177653ce78406decfb"><name>north-perimeter-lot-changes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>North Remote Lot is now North Perimeter Lot - permit requirements have changed</title><summary>Please be advised that as of September 1, 2018, the North Remote lot has been renamed the North Perimeter Lot and R permits will no longer be valid therein.

<p>The endowed chair was created to advance the cause of diversity, equity, and inclusive excellence in astronomy. The holder of the chair will embody the spirit of diversity in one of a variety of ways, such as their proven ability to attract and train new astronomers from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Sandra Faber, professor emerita of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, and her husband Andrew Faber launched the campaign for the Rubin Chair with an initial gift of $250,000. The chair is named for the distinguished astronomer Vera Rubin (1928-2016), who was a champion of inclusivity in science.</p>
<p>For Sandra Faber, who worked with Rubin at the Carnegie Institution of Washington early in her career, the more experienced astronomer served as a model of a successful woman in a field dominated by men. "At a time when few women succeeded in science, especially astrophysics, Rubin began to pave the way for all members of underrepresented groups," Faber said.</p>
<p>Rubin helped transform modern astrophysics through her research on the rotation rates of galaxies, making crucial contributions to the evidence that galaxies and stars are immersed in the gravitational grip of vast clouds of dark matter. Faber said she learned a lot about how to be an astronomer while working alongside Rubin, from how to give a scientific talk to the importance of careful measurements and respect for the data.</p>
<p>"She was playing in the big leagues, and she was also raising a family. It told me that I could do this too," Faber said.</p>
<p>Dozens of astronomers from varied backgrounds remember with gratitude Rubin's deep interest and encouragement of their budding careers. Her passion to open doors to all qualified persons makes her the perfect namesake for UC Santa Cruz's newest endowed chair, according to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor and chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p>
<p>A novel feature of the Rubin Chair is its emphasis on using the proceeds from the endowment to enhance the department's ability to attract and support aspiring astronomers from underrepresented groups, he said. Endowed chairs are typically used to pay the salary or support the research of the chair holder, whereas the holder of the Rubin Chair might use the funds for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships or undergraduate research internships.</p>
<p>"The Rubin Chair will be a bridge of support across cultural, ethnic, and economic hurdles to engage the brightest minds in astronomy," said Ramirez-Ruiz, adding that diversity is a source of strength and excellence for the astronomy department.</p>
<p>Women have composed half of UC Santa Cruz astronomy Ph.D. students for more than a decade, and 30 percent of current graduate students come from underrepresented backgrounds. The department's six active women professors are the largest tenured cohort of female astronomers in the nation, led by eminent scientists such as Faber and Claire Max, director of UC Observatories.</p>
<p>Faber, like Rubin before her, has been honored with the National Medal of Science, the Gruber Prize for Cosmology, and many other awards and honors. Her research interests include cosmology, galaxy formation, and astronomical instrumentation. Faber has also been a driving force in the development and evolution of the Osterbrock Leadership Program, which offers leadership lectures, workshops, field trips, and other opportunities to all interested graduate students in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. This program is unique to UC Santa Cruz and sets the department apart from all other top astronomy programs. It is also testament to Faber's commitment to advancing the careers of young women and students from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>In addition to the gift from the Fabers, which came from a significant portion of the Gruber Prize, the Rubin Chair endowment fund has received major contributions from the Heising-Simons Foundation, John and Barbara Crary, and an anonymous donor. Other donors include the Rubin family, Mark Headley, Claudia Webster, Joanna Miller, and Loren Kinczel. The UC Office of the President provided matching funds of $500,000.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="868b7926807270173e9c65aef0cdf2d7"><name>new-diversity-online-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New diversity, equity, and inclusion online program joins two other requirements for entering students</title><summary>We Are Slugs! combines two online requirements AlcoholEdu for College Students and Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergraduates (the latter previously called Haven) with a new program, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for Students.</summary><start-date>1535495400000</start-date><display-name>New diversity, equity, and inclusion online program joins two other requirements for entering students</display-name><path>/2018/08/new-diversity-online-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/08/new-diversity-online-program</link><created-by>rsirles</created-by><created-on>1535560612097</created-on><last-modified-by>rsirles</last-modified-by><last-modified>1535560975472</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Today all entering frosh and transfer students will receive an email informing them of a new requirement to be completed upon registering for fall quarter. <a href="http://weareslugs.ucsc.edu/">We Are Slugs!</a> combines two online requirements <a href="https://everfi.com/offerings/listing/alcoholedu-for-college/">AlcoholEdu for College Students</a> and <a href="https://everfi.com/offerings/listing/sexual-assault-prevention-undergraduates/">Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergraduates</a> (the latter previously called Haven) with a new program, <a href="https://everfi.com/offerings/listing/diversity-equity-inclusion-for-students/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for Students</a>.

<p>For the first time, the latest periodic report incorporates in-depth regional assessments, including one for challenges faced by the Central Coast. Ruth Langridge, an associate researcher in the Politics Department, was the coordinating lead author of the <a href="http://www.climateassessment.ca.gov/regions/docs/20180827-CentralCoast.pdf">Central Coast Region Report</a>; she convened a panel of expert contributors to report on impacts to water, ecosystems, energy, transportation, public health, agriculture, and other sectors.</p>
<p>"The Central Coast is over 90 percent natural lands, and we examined in detail the climate change impacts to the many ecosystems in our region," said Langridge. The report identifies how climate impacts will affect residents and communities, as well as what the region is doing to adapt.</p>
<p>Highlights of Central Coast impacts include sea-level rise; drought and water-supply shortages; wildfire; wildlife disturbance; impacts on streams, rivers and aquatic life; loss of beaches to erosion; heat-related illness among agricultural workers; and significant impacts on agriculture, particularly the Salinas Valley.</p>
<p>UCSC contributors include Dan Brumbaugh, associate researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences; Yihsu Chen, associate professor of technology management; Na Chen, a former UCSC postdoctoral researcher who is now an assistant professor of planning at the University of Cincinnati; Laurel Fox, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology; David Herbst, a research biologist with the Institute of Marine Sciences; Michael Loik, professor of environmental studies; Mark Snyder, project scientist in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department; and Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>In addition, Gary Griggs, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences, was a lead author and the working-group chair of the <a href="http://www.climateassessment.ca.gov/state/docs/20180827-OceanCoastSummary.PDF">California's Coast and Oceans Summary Report</a>.</p>
<p>The statewide report warns that two-thirds of Southern California&#8217;s beaches could completely disappear and the average area burned by wildfires could nearly double by 2100 and provides planning tools to support the state&#8217;s response.</p>
<p>"In California, facts and science still matter," said Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. "These findings are profoundly serious and will continue to guide us as we confront the apocalyptic threat of irreversible climate change."</p>
<p>The authors summarized the state of the science on observed and modeled climate change including temperature, precipitation, fog, extreme storm and drought events, and the impacts on sea level rise, runoff, wildfire, and floods.</p>
<p>The compilation of original climate research includes 44 technical reports and 13 summary reports on climate change impacts to help ready the state for a future punctuated by severe wildfires, more frequent and longer droughts, rising sea levels, increased flooding, coastal erosion and extreme heat events. The peer-reviewed research translates global models into scaled-down, regional reports that fill information gaps and support decisions at the local, regional, and state levels.</p>
<p>California has completed three prior Climate Change Assessments. Since the release of California&#8217;s Third Climate Change Assessment in 2012, the state has experienced several of the most extreme natural events in its recorded history, including a severe five-year drought, an unprecedented tree mortality crisis, damaging floods driven by atmospheric rivers, and increasingly large and destructive wildfires.</p>
<p>The Fourth Assessment suggests these events will worsen in the future. Among the key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wildfire</strong>: Climate change will make forests more susceptible to extreme wildfires. By the year 2100, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, one study found that the average area burned by wildfires would increase 77 percent and the frequency of extreme wildfires burning more than 25,000 acres would increase by nearly 50 percent. In the areas that have the highest fire risk, the cost of wildfire insurance is estimated to rise by 18 percent by 2055. Additionally, the percentage of property insured in California would decrease.</li>
<li><strong>Sea-Level Rise</strong>: Under mid to high sea-level rise scenarios, up to 67 percent of Southern California beaches may completely erode by 2100 without large-scale human interventions. Statewide damages could reach nearly $17.9 billion from inundation of residential and commercial buildings if sea-level rise reaches 20 inches, which is within range of mid-century projections. A 100-year coastal flood, on top of this level of sea-level rise, would almost double the cost of damages. Updated modeling can help local planners analyze vulnerabilities in their area.</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: Higher temperatures will increase annual electricity demand for homes, primarily for use of air conditioning units. High demand is projected in inland regions and Southern California. More moderate increases are projected in cooler coastal areas. Increases in peak hourly demand during the hot months of the year could be more pronounced. This is a critical finding for California&#8217;s electric system, because generating capacity must match peak electricity demand.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Heat Events and Impacts on Public Health</strong>: Heat-related illnesses and deaths are projected to worsen drastically throughout the state. By mid-century, the Central Valley is projected to experience heat waves that average two weeks longer than those today, and the hot spells could occur four to 10 times more often in the Northern Sierra region. A new California Heat Assessment Tool (CHAT) could support public health departments as they work to reduce heat-related deaths and illnesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;The latest reports also detail the unique and disproportionate climate threats to vulnerable communities and tribal communities, with a focus on working collaboratively with these communities on research and solutions for resilience.</p>
<p>In addition, a report set for release in early September will highlight how California can better integrate climate impacts in design processes for critical infrastructure. The report by a working group established by AB 2800 (Quirk) of 2016 reflects the expertise of multiple scientific and engineering disciplines to help design and construct infrastructure to withstand higher temperatures, more frequent and intense storms, drought, wildfires and sea-level rise.</p>
<p>To access Fourth Assessment technical reports, summary reports, online tools, climate projects and data, and other resources and information developed as part of California&#8217;s Fourth Climate Change Assessment, go to www.ClimateAssessment.ca.gov.</p>
<p>California is a global leader in using, investing in, and advancing research to set proactive climate change policy. Its climate change assessments provide the scientific foundation for understanding climate-related vulnerability and how Californians may respond. The Climate Change Assessments directly inform state policies, plans, programs, and guidance to promote effective and integrated action to safeguard California from climate change.</p>
<p>California&#8212;which is playing a world-leading role in building strong coalitions of partners committed to curbing carbon pollution in both the United States and around the globe&#8212;will convene the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco next month. At the summit, representatives from subnational governments, businesses and civil society will showcase the surge of climate action around the world, and make the case that even more must be done.</p>

The 2018 theme is infrastructure, and it refers not only to the basics of city infrastructure--such as joists and support beams--but also to the human and ecological frameworks affected by physical systems. <br/><br/>This year&#8217;s festival, <a href="http://biennial8.soundwavesf.com"><strong><em>Soundwave ((8)) Infrastructure</em></strong></a>, runs September through October with six curated performances throughout San Francisco and Oakland.</p>
<p>It kicks off on September 8, at Counter Plus in San Francisco with "HVAC: Thermal Comfort," a new work by UC Santa Cruz art lecturer Dana Hemenway and San Francisco media artist and composer Surabhi Saraf. The piece is described as &#8220;a journey through sculpture, movement, and sound to contemplate how heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems play out on the human body.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Hemenway received her B.A. in art from UC Santa Cruz in 2003. She has had residencies at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art (Omaha, NE), S&#205;M (Reykjavik, Iceland), The Wassaic Project (Upstate New York), Root Division (San Francisco, CA), and is a charter resident of the Minnesota Street Project&#8217;s Studio Program in San Francisco.</p>
<p>She is also the recipient of The San Francisco Arts Commission Individual Artist Grant, and was awarded her first permanent Public Art Commission for SFO&#8217;s Terminal 1, which is scheduled for completion in late 2019. <br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz arts alumna <a href="https://alexachristineburrell.com"><em><strong>Alexa Burrell</strong></em></a> will be one of three artists featured in "Time: Miracle" at Lake Merritt&#8217;s Bonsai Garden on October 5. This work in an investigation of trauma and healing and its relationship with structural systems such as time and space on a personal and historical level. <br/><br/>Burrell earned a B.F.A. with an emphasis on sound and video from UCSC in 2010 and is now a multimedia artist who composes intricate sonic and video works consisting mostly of sampled and found media. Her works emphasize the textural and visceral qualities of body, voice and identity. Burrell is the video artist for <a href="http://housefullofblackwomen.com/about"><em><strong>House/Full of Blackwomen</strong></em></a>, a performance collective created by Amara Tabor-Smith and Ellen Sebastian-Chang. Her work has been featured at Pro Arts Gallery, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, SomArts Cultural Center, and Eastside Arts Alliance.<br/><br/>Burrell has additionally been nominated for Soundwave&#8217;s Buzz Award this year--an honor recognizing an emerging Bay Area artist who is making an impact in their particular sound/music field and has demonstrated great potential and commitment to performance and immersive art. <br/><br/>Assistant professor of film and digital media Anna Friz will also perform in "Transmission" on October 19, at the Laundry in San Francisco, along with artists Andy Puls and Madalyn Merkey. This performance is described as &#8220;a collection of new media artists examining sound as ephemeral material charged with the physical capacity to embody listeners to engage memory, imagination and contemplation with the liveness of sound.&#8221;<br/><br/>Friz specializes in multichannel radio transmission systems for installation, performance, and broadcast, or works in which radio is often the source, subject, and medium of the work.</p>
<p>She also composes sound works and installations for theater, dance, film, and solo performance that reflect upon public media culture, political landscapes and systems, time perception, the intimacy of signal space, and speculative fictions. In the past year, her work has been presented at Ars Electronica Big Concert Night (Linz, Austria), the Museum of Arts and Design (New York), and Tsonami Festival de Arte Sonoro (Valpara&#237;so and Santiago, Chile). <br/><br/><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been really impressed</strong> with the enthusiasm and dedication of the Soundwave group to put on such an incredible festival that has continued to push and evolve the boundaries of the sound art scene to include new media works, video, and performance,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz art professor Jennifer Parker, who joined the Soundwave board of directors in 2017. &#8220;The scene is eclectic, diverse, and inclusive.&#8221;<br/><br/>Parker first became involved with Soundwave in 2012, when founder Alan So invited her to produce an exhibition for the <em>Soundwave ((5))</em> Humanities biennial. Working with UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://openlabresearch.com"><em><strong>OpenLab</strong></em></a>, she developed a series of works with Ph.D. students in music, graduate students in digital arts and new media, and undergraduates in art, physics and engineering. These projects were installed for three months at Intersection for the Arts in San Francisco. <br/><br/>For <em>Soundwave ((6))</em> Water, Parker introduced OpenLab&#8217;s <a href="http://oceanicscales.com"><strong><em>Oceanic Scales interactive art and science puzzle</em> </strong></a>at the California Academy of Art and developed an exhibit for their Water World Exhibit at Alterspace in San Francisco.<br/><br/>&#8220;One of the great things about Soundwave is the number of active artists, designers, producers who make up the board,&#8221; said Parker. &#8220;The group has a unique vision, carefully crafted by a diverse set of select curators, to create outstanding programming in both traditional and more radically untapped spaces throughout the Bay Area.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;My specific role on the board this year has been to help envision future programming with the group for the next biennial, while working with board members and curators to identify and secure venues for programming,&#8221; she added.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="87c34d62807270173e9c65aec4e51f47"><name>vandalism-at-merrill</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vandalism at Merrill College (Case no. 18-951, 18-952)</title><summary>On Monday (Aug. 27), two incidents of vandalism were reported to the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.

With the City of Santa Cruz adopting a <a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/government/city-departments/water/2018-water-use-restrictions">stage one</a> water shortage alert, I want to remind everyone in the campus community to ensure they're minimizing their water use.</p>
<p>While rains helped to end the most stringent water restrictions, we should all continue with a water-saving mindset, given the uncertainty of what this winter will bring and the cyclical nature of droughts.</p>
<p>Small decisions every individual makes around water conservation, both on campus and within our community, greatly help conserve our water resources. These decisions can be as simple as being mindful of water usage in our daily routines, to alerting the campus when of a potential leak within or outside our buildings.</p>
<p>Please report any leaks&#8212;no matter how small&#8212;by going to <a href="http://fixit.ucsc.edu/">fixit.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>A few water-saving tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off the water when soaping your hands, shaving, brushing your teeth, and washing dishes.</li>
<li>Shorten your showers.</li>
<li>Don't let dishes sit out, since dishes with dried-on food are harder to wash.</li>
<li>Run full loads in the laundry or dishwashing machines.</li>
<li>Encourage your peers to be water efficient and aware</li>
</ul>

<p>The city&#8217;s stage one restrictions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No landscape watering between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. (exceptions include drip irrigation, soaker hoses, watering cans).</li>
<li>Hose nozzles required.</li>
<li>No washing down hard or paved surfaces (exceptions include health or sanitation hazards).</li>
<li>No initial filling, draining, or refilling of swimming pools.</li>
</ul>
