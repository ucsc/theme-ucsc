Inspiration: Exploring UC Santa Cruz Natural Landscapes' opens November 6 at the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery in Cowell College</article-subhead><article-text><p>An exhibit of artwork created on the five UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves reflects the diversity of the reserves and the ways in which interacting with nature can spawn artistic creation, imaginative thought processes, and scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>"Reserves of Inspiration: Exploring UC Santa Cruz Natural Landscapes" will run from November 6 to December 8, 2018, at the <a href="https://cowell.ucsc.edu/smith-gallery/">Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery</a> in Cowell College. Featured artists include UCSC alumnae Jenny Keller, Stephanie Martin, and Erika Perloff, whose works will be exhibited alongside those of other local professionals and student artists.</p>
<p>Hosted by the <a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/">Norris Center for Natural History</a> and the <a href="https://naturalreserves.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Natural Reserves</a>, the exhibit showcases the natural reserves as a resource for experiential learning and highlights the value of art as a way of exploring and learning about the natural world, said reserves director Gage Dayton.</p>
<p>"It's an opportunity to show what the natural reserves provide through an artistic lens. We're not just about scientific research," Dayton said.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz manages the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve and four reserves that are part of the larger <a href="https://ucnrs.org/">UC Natural Reserve System</a>&#8212;Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve, Fort Ord Natural Reserve, A&#241;o Nuevo Natural Reserve, and Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve. The wide range of habitats, from fog-enshrouded redwood forest to maritime chaparral, provide an unparalleled natural laboratory and serve as study sites for university scientists and students.</p>
<p>All three of the featured artists first visited the reserves as students in the Natural History Field Quarter course in the 1980s. "We weren't all in the same year, but we knew each other and we all had major interests in art, science, and education," said Stephanie Martin, who earned her teaching credential at UCSC and taught in local schools for 24 years before returning to art as a second career about 12 years ago.</p>
<p>"I was so excited to be invited to take part in this exhibit and to spend time in the reserves as an artist. It's nice because our art complements each other. We work in different mediums, so it's interesting to see our different interpretations of the same places," Martin said.</p>
<p>In addition to the featured artists, the organizers of the exhibit held an open solicitation and selected 26 art works by students, alumni, and community members who have used the reserves for their work.</p>
<p>Chris Lay, director of the Norris Center for Natural History, said the exhibit represents the growth and depth of collaboration between the center and the natural reserves, which have overlapping interests.</p>
<p>"Our shared goals include getting every student out in a reserve through some class or activity during their time here, supporting more art activities at the reserves, and better documenting the biodiversity of the reserves," Lay said. "Getting more people out observing, drawing, and making field guides for the reserves will help us keep track of what's there and how it's changing over time."</p>
<p>The natural reserves are used by a wide range of UCSC art classes, from drawing and photography to sculpture and environmental art, as well as by courses in science illustration and natural history illustration.</p>
<p>Brett Bell, who has four paintings in the exhibit, discovered the reserves as an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, visiting Big Creek with classes and exploring the campus reserve and other open spaces on and around the campus. "Without access to spaces like that, I don't think I would be as connected to nature or have the observational skills that help me as an artist," Bell said.</p>
<p>After earning his B.A. in environmental studies and biology in 2012 and working in outdoor youth education programs for a few years, Bell enrolled in the Science Illustration Certificate program at CSU Monterey Bay in 2017 and has been working on art projects with Fort Ord Natural Reserve manager Joe Miller.</p>
<p>"Having natural environments with relatively little disturbance is important, especially for generations that grow up with less exposure to that. Its value keeps getting higher, whether it's for artistic inspiration, research, or just therapy," he said.</p>
<p>Martin noted that, while larger reserves such as Big Creek understandably get most of the glory for their size, grandeur, and diversity of landscape and habitat, the smaller ones such as Fort Ord are also extremely important. "Fort Ord not only preserves a rare habitat, its proximity to the city of Seaside makes it accessible to local schoolchildren for outdoor education programs. It&#8217;s small but mighty, and vital for inspiring the next generation of naturalists and scientists."</p>
<p>The Smith Gallery is open Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. Two special open house events are scheduled for this exhibit, on Saturday, November 10 (12 to 5 p.m.), and Friday, December 7 (5 to 8 p.m.), when the gallery will have additional staff and activities for the public. Much of the artwork will be available for purchase.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>12-10-2018</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="caf6e7af807270172739340f7571f25e"><name>phthalate-alternatives</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC chemists develop safe alternatives to phthalates used in plastics</title><summary>Growing concern over the health effects of phthalates has spurred a search for alternatives that can add flexibility to plastics without leaching out.</summary><keywords>Rebecca Braslau, phthalates</keywords><start-date>1541080800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC chemists develop safe alternatives to phthalates used in plastics</display-name><path>/2018/11/phthalate-alternatives</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/phthalate-alternatives</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1541003469768</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1541087346883</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tom Garlinghouse</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/cover-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/cover-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-350.jpg</name><display-name>cover-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>135696</file-size><width>350</width><height>466</height></image><image-alt>journal cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16215</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>journal cover image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/rebecca-braslau-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/rebecca-braslau-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rebecca-braslau-300.jpg</name><display-name>rebecca-braslau-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>90279</file-size><width>300</width><height>352</height></image><image-alt>Rebecca Braslau</image-alt><image-caption>Rebecca Braslau (photo by C. Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Growing concern over the health effects of phthalates has spurred a search for alternatives that can add flexibility to plastics without leaching out</article-subhead><article-text><p>Researchers at UC Santa Cruz have developed safer alternatives to the phthalate plasticizers used to enhance the suppleness, flexibility, and longevity of plastics.</p>
<p>The problem with phthalates is that they leach out of plastics into food, water, and the environment, and there is mounting evidence suggesting that phthalate exposure can lead to a variety of health problems.</p>
<p>Researchers led by Rebecca Braslau, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, addressed this problem by developing chemicals that are effective as plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) but can't leach out of PVC products because they are chemically bonded to the polymer chain. The team reported their findings in a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pola.29205">paper published in the<em> Journal of Polymer Science</em></a> (online September 26 and in the November 1 print issue).</p>
<p>Phthalates are used in a wide variety of products, but their most widespread use is as plasticizers for PVC, one of the most common types of plastic. After polypropylene and polyethylene, PVC is the third most common plastic polymer and is used to make products such as building materials, furniture, clothing, garden hoses, food packaging, blood-storage containers, and medical devices.</p>
<p>Braslau's team has been working to develop "nonmigratory" plasticizers that attach to the PVC polymer via a chemical bond and can't leach out of the plastic. She explained that traditionally, phthalates are mixed with fine-ground PVC and &#8220;melted together&#8221; rather than being bonded.</p>
<p>"Unlike phthalates, our nonmigratory plasticizers physically can't leach out," Braslau said.</p>
<p>Her lab has produced several viable nonmigratory plasticizers, including two dubbed the &#8220;frog&#8221; and the &#8220;tadpole&#8221; because of their chemical structures. The "tadpole" is particularly promising, Braslau said, because it is much easier to produce than the "frog" and is the most effective of the plasticizing strategies examined.</p>
<p>"Fewer steps and fewer chemicals are involved in its synthesis. Importantly, it should be scalable for industrial use,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The research into phthalate alternatives was prompted by growing concerns about the potential health risks posed by phthalates. Certain phthalates are considered endocrine disruptors because they or their metabolites interfere with the body's hormone system. Most of the studies showing harmful effects have been done in lab animals, but some human studies have also found associations between exposure to phthalates and adverse reproductive and developmental effects.</p>
<p>How phthalates affect human health and at what levels of exposure are still unresolved questions, but researchers are particularly concerned about potential effects on infants and children. Bans on the use of phthalates in children's toys and childcare products have been imposed by both the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the use of phthalates in other products remains widespread. They are found in vinyl siding and flooring, shower curtains, children's rain gear, and even in personal care products such as shampoos and cosmetics. As a result, phthalates are now widely dispersed throughout the environment, and most people have detectable amounts in their blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are everywhere we touch,&#8221; Braslau said.</p>
<p>Eventually, Braslau and her team hope to see their safer nonmigratory plasticizers adopted by the plastics industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The potential for this is real,&#8221; she said, though she admitted that trying to change the plastics industry is like &#8220;trying to turn the Queen Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Braslau, the authors of the paper include first author Chad Higa, who earned his Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz in 2018 and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hawaii; and Andy Tek and Rudy Wojtecki, both at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose.

<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>It is my sad duty to inform you that our beloved colleague, Helene Moglen, passed away in the early morning of October 18. Helene was an institution at UCSC and in the Humanities Division in particular. Educated at Bryn Mawr and Yale, she was on the English Literature faculty at NYU and SUNY Purchase. Her leadership experience at SUNY Purchase included serving as President of the Faculty and Acting Dean of Humanities, and famously founding the first women&#8217;s studies program with her colleagues.</p>
<p>Helene first came to UCSC in 1978 as a professor of literature and dean of the humanities; she was the first woman dean in the University of California system. She also served as provost of Kresge College until 1983, transforming and revitalizing that college into a vibrant intellectual community. In her dual role as dean and provost, the Humanities Division became a home for several notable academic departments, including the dynamic and expanding American studies program and the prestigious history of consciousness program.</p>
<p>Helene helped to shape the modern UCSC campus: she opened up the west campus, establishing an independent School of Arts, integrated writing into the foundation curriculum, and established and chaired the Committee on Sexual Harassment. She continued her service to the division, serving as chair of the Women's Studies program from 1984-1989, in addition to founding the Focused Research Activity (FRA) in Women&#8217;s/Feminist Studies.</p>
<p>Helene was appointed to the prestigious Presidential Chair in Literature in 2003. The chair&#8217;s funding allowed Helene to establish the Institute of Advanced Feminist Research and support its program of research. The Institute was a cross-disciplinary, transgenerational, collaborative bridge within the university and the wider community. It sponsored reading groups, conferences, publication projects, graduate student research, and campus outreach.</p>
<p>Helene routinely taught two undergraduate courses &#8220;The Gothic Imagination&#8221; and &#8220;Women&#8217;s Literature&#8221; as well as graduate seminars on the &#8220;Politics of Genre&#8221; and &#8220;Women Writers.&#8221; She retired in 2008, but remained engaged by teaching until 2013 and mentoring graduate students and junior faculty.</p>
<p>She published four monographs: <em>The Trauma of Gender: A Feminist Theory of the English Novel </em>(2001)<em>, Sexual and Gender Harassment in the Academy: A Guide for Faculty, Students, and Administrators</em> (1981),<em> The Philosophical Irony of Laurence Sterne </em>(1976)<em>, </em>and<em> Charlotte Bronte: The Self Conceived </em>(1975). She co-edited five collections which explored the intersection of literature and feminism.</p>
<p>Helene had a major impact on the intellectual and political life of Santa Cruz, and was known for her warmth, commitment to community and humanity, and her love of literature. A former colleague shared that &#8220;Helene genuinely loved UCSC and believed in it. She loved that it was public, quirky, open, physically beautiful, experimental, and capable of nurturing both brilliant ideas and intense human connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope you will all take a moment to remember her and her legacy. &#160;She will be missed. <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/index.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=780&amp;dids=934&amp;bledit=1">Donations in honor of her memory will be gratefully received by the Center for Cultural Studies of the University of California, Santa Cruz.</a></p>

American poet, essayist, and environmental activist Gary Snyder&#160;will be the featured guest at the ninth annual&#160;<a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/morton-marcus-poetry-reading-gary-snyder/"><strong><em>Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading</em></strong></a> on Thursday, November 15, at the Music Center Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>Snyder began his career in the 1950s as a notable member of the Beat Generation, but then moved on to explore a wide array of social and spiritual topics in poetry and prose.</p>
<p>Often described as the "poet laureate of Deep Ecology,"&#160;Snyder has become a spokesman for the preservation of the natural world and the cultures that seek to protect it.</p>
<p>In 1955, he famously read his poem "Berry Feast" at San Francisco's Six Gallery reading, alongside fellow Beat poet Allen Ginsberg and in front of his friends, Jack Kerouac and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.</p>
<p>The following year, Snyder moved to Japan to study Zen Buddhism and later traveled extensively throughout Asia. His poetry is influenced by Japanese haiku and Chinese verse, as well as the study of anthropology and oral traditions.</p>
<p>Snyder is the author of nearly two dozen books of poetry and prose. In 1975, his collection <em>Turtle Island</em> was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry.</p>
<p>He received the American Book Award in 1984 for <em>Axe Handles</em>, and his 1992 collection,&#160;<em>No Nature</em>, was named a National Book Award finalist. And in 2012, Snyder received the Wallace Stevens Award for lifetime achievement by the Academy of American Poets.</p>
<p><strong>The Morton Marcus Memorial Poetry Reading</strong> is held each year to honor poet, teacher, film critic, and Santa Cruz cultural icon Morton Marcus (1936-2009).</p>
<p>It was created to continue Marcus&#8217;s tradition of bringing acclaimed poets to Santa Cruz County, to acknowledge the significant role poetry has played in the community's history, and to help preserve poetry's influence in the county's culture.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz humanities lecturer and alumnus <strong>Gary Young</strong>--Santa Cruz's first ever poet laureate--will host the program and present a&#160;cash prize to the winner of the annual Morton Marcus Poetry Contest.</p>
<p>The event will also include a special appearance by UC Santa Cruz alumnus <strong>Tom Killion</strong>, who is internationally known for his vividly colored woodcut prints of the California landscape.</p>
<p>Killion has collaborated on several books with Snyder, including <em>California&#8217;s Wild Edge</em>, <em>Tamalpais Walking</em>, and <em>The High Sierra of California</em>.</p>
<p>Presented by <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/morton-marcus-poetry-reading-gary-snyder/"><strong><em>The Humanities Institute</em></strong></a> at UC Santa Cruz, this is a community event, co-sponsored by the Living Writers Series, Porter Hitchcock Modern Poetry Fund, Special Collections &amp; Archives, Cowell College, Porter College, Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, Ow Family Properties; Poetry Santa Cruz; Cabrillo College English Department; Santa Cruz Writes; and Bookshop Santa Cruz.<br/> <br/> Admission is free, and the public is invited. A book signing and reception will follow the reading.</p>
<p>The festivities begin at 6 p.m.</p>

<div>This year, the campus is making it as easy as possible for you to cast your ballot.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://urelations.ucsc.edu/about/units/government/vote/index.html">Six campus polling stations</a> will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 6.

<div>This year, the State of California is allowing <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/conditional-voter-reg/">Conditional Voter Registration</a> at select polling locations, including the Bay Tree Bookstore and the Santa Cruz County Elections office.&#160; At these sites, you can register and vote conditionally. Conditional ballots will be processed once the county elections office has completed the voter registration verification process.</div>
<div>&#160;</div>
<div>Voters can complete the conditional voter registration process from October 22 all the way through Election Day on Nov. 6.

Although there is heavy smoke on campus as a result of the fire, which started Saturday evening and is burning in heavy timber between the highway and the San Lorenzo River, there is no threat to UC Santa Cruz at this time.</p>
<p>There are several fire crews on the ground, as well as helicopters and planes being used to drop fire retardant on the roughly 5-acre blaze. Some of the aircraft are flying over campus to access the fire. Some crews may also use campus fire roads to access the fire.</p>
<p>The Paradise Park neighborhood, along with adjoining neighborhoods, are being evacuated as a precaution.</p>

<p>The materials on the website are part of a nationwide network of teaching center websites that share materials related to topics such as active and student-centered learning, inclusive teaching, effective mentoring, and the design and delivery of successful courses. These materials are grounded in research on how to promote learning in college classrooms, and draw on fields as diverse as cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, and the science of learning. Instructors can also find information about how to document their teaching for a job search or personnel review, as well as a<a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/teaching-resources/on-campus/"> comprehensive listing of campus resources</a> for students facing academic or personal challenges.</p>
<p>The website was designed and curated by CITL Associate Director for Programs Kendra Dority and Graduate Student Researcher Kristin Miller, a Ph.D. candidate in the Sociology Department. Support for the website construction came from the Graduate Division, as well as from the CITL. In assembling materials for the site, Dority and Miller sought to provide a virtual hub for anyone wanting to consult respected, evidence-based resources on effective teaching and engaged learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;When building the website, we aimed to compile the most practical resources on the topics that we have learned, through our own experiences as educators as well as through interactions with faculty and graduate students at CITL programs, are most important to instructors at UC Santa Cruz. The resources we have included are also those that best distill the current research on teaching and learning into an accessible format for busy instructors,&#8221; Dority said of her work with Miller. &#8220;We look forward to growing the resource library to respond to instructor needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We kept CITL&#8217;s commitments to equity and accessibility in mind at every stage of the process,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;It was rewarding to figure out how to translate pedagogical ideas about clear communication and inclusivity into effective information architecture and visual design.&#8221;</p>
<p>While UC Santa Cruz has a long history of dedication to outstanding undergraduate and graduate education, the website is the first attempt to make the recent outpouring of research- and evidence-based teaching practices developed specifically for higher education easily accessible to all those who teach on campus. The idea was that any instructor designing a new course or revamping an existing one, wondering about how to create a good assignment or write a rubric, or wanting to find out how to make their classroom a more equitable and inclusive space for student discussions or groupwork, could simply consult a single website, or at least start a search for information there.</p>
<p>In addition, the website will house a small archive of short videos with quick tips about teaching practices from members of the UC Santa Cruz faculty. The <a href="https://citl.ucsc.edu/news/media/">first two of these videos</a>&#8212;on active learning and inclusive teaching in large lecture courses&#8212;are available now.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e55f4729807270172739340ff81f0bf1"><name>hammack-relationships</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From asexuality to heteroflexibility: 21st century ushers in new openness about intimate relationships </title><summary>The 21st century has ushered in a "quiet revolution" in the diversity of intimate relationships, and a leading scholar says the scale and pace of this social transformation warrants a "reboot" of relationship studies.</summary><keywords>sexuality, intimacy, relationships, queer, LGBT, gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, polyamory</keywords><start-date>1541404800000</start-date><display-name>Hammack-Relationships</display-name><path>/2018/11/hammack-relationships</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/hammack-relationships</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1541446517540</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1541447077300</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/hammack_285.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/hammack_285.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hammack_285.jpg</name><display-name>hammack_285.jpg</display-name><file-size>28675</file-size><width>285</width><height>318</height></image><image-alt>Head shot of Phil Hammack</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/hammack_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/hammack_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hammack_80.jpg</name><display-name>hammack_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>7244</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Head shot of Phil Hammack</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>"We have to begin with documenting the diversity of what's happening out there," said Psychology Professor Phil Hammack, lead author of an article that calls for greater recognition of intimate relationships that challenge norms.

<p>Social media and the internet have empowered individuals with diverse identities and relationship practices to find each other, raising awareness of connections that challenge traditional ideas about the meaning of intimacy, according to Phillip Hammack, professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>People are thriving in intimate relationships far from the cultural norms of monogamy and heterosexuality, including asexual, polyamorous, transgender and gender nonbinary, pansexual, and kink/fetish relationships, said Hammack.</p>
<p>"I've been calling it a quiet revolution, because it's very different than the sexual revolutions of the 1960s and '70s, which were so visible," said Hammack, who studies sexual and gender-identity diversity.</p>
<p>Hammack is the lead author of "Queer Intimacies: A New Paradigm for the Study of Relationship Diversity," an article that appears in the current online edition of <em>The Journal of Sex Research</em>. By "queer intimacies," Hammack means any and all intimate relationships that challenge norms. "It's a use of 'queer' that actually originated at UC Santa Cruz with the phrase 'queer theory' in 1990," noted Hammack.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Marriage equality as a catalyst for change</u></em></strong></p>
<p>Hammack says marriage equality, or the legalization in 2015 of same-sex marriage, is the backdrop for the explosion of relationship diversity that has occurred since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>"Marriage equality opens up the lens to think about diversity beyond just the gender of the people in a relationship," said Hammack, noting that asexuality, polyamory, and kink/fetish all challenge dominant notions of intimacy.</p>
<p>"It's a myth that asexual people aren't in relationships just because they experience little or no sexual desire," said Hammack. "The assumption is that they are suffering, lonely, and without partners, but that's not true. They do have intimate relationships, but we don't know much about them."</p>
<p>People who identify as asexual "violate the fundamental assumption that intimate relationships are inherently characterized by sex," said Hammack.</p>
<p>They started to organize in the early 2000s&#8212;"thanks to the internet," he said. Asexuality was removed from the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013.</p>
<p>In a similar challenge to cultural norms, those who choose polyamorous relationships violate conventions of monogamy by allowing partners to love more than one person. Although gay men have a long tradition of open relationships, and "swinging" was favored by some straight couples in the 1970s, polyamory now appears in the Oxford English Dictionary, following what Hammack called a "simmering movement that challenged heteronormative conventions about what an ideal relationship is supposed to look like."</p>
<p>The success of the 2011 novel <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> propelled mainstream discussion of kink/fetish relationships, which highlight consensual asymmetrical power dynamics in intimate relationships. "The novel was problematic, because it didn't accurately represent the consensual way relationships are configured in the kink community," said Hammack, adding, "Kink relationships have been stigmatized because the expectation is that relationships are supposed to be 'equal'."</p>
<p>Researchers know little about what happens within kink/fetish relationships. "To what extent is the power asymmetry just during sex? We don't know," said Hammack. "Most of this science doesn't talk about the relationships. It just talks about specific kinky practices."</p>
<p>"That's one of the frustrations. There's almost no recognition of <em>relationships</em>&#8212;it's all about sexual gratification, which is only part of the picture," said Hammack.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Next steps: "We don't have good data"</u></em></strong></p>
<p>During the lengthy campaign for marriage equality, "all the preconceptions about intimacy were being challenged&#8212;some quietly, some less quietly," said Hammack. The Supreme Court's landmark decision empowered and emboldened those who choose other forms of intimate relationships, energizing some to push for recognition of their relationship choices, too.</p>
<p>As a result, new questions need to be explored, including the emergence of "queer heterosexuality" and changes in ideas about "chosen families."</p>
<p>"One of the most interesting things we're seeing is that heterosexuality is opening up like never before," said Hammack. "More people who identify as straight will have some same-sex experience&#8212;they even refer to 'heteroflexibility.' They are not opposed to same-sex encounters."</p>
<p>This trend is long-established among women, but it's new among men&#8212;and it's distinct from bisexuality because these men don't feel equally attracted to men and women. "It's fascinating to see masculinity opening up this way," he said.</p>
<p>Hammack said "very, very little" is known about the phenomenon of chosen families&#8212;as distinct from biological families. It's a phenomenon that has been historically associated with gays and lesbians who "create their own families" after being rejected by biological relatives, but its prevalence remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Hammack, who is launching a new research initiative focused on diversity in intimate relationships, calls on his colleagues in relationship and sexuality studies to broaden the scope of their own research.</p>
<p>"We have to begin with documenting the diversity of what's happening out there," said Hammack. "We don't have good data. This article reviews what we have, and it's not that much."</p>
<p>Hammack's coauthors on the article are David Frost, associate professor of social psychology at University College London, and Sam Hughes, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page

Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>New findings add to growing evidence that previously dismissed "junk DNA" actually produces RNA molecules with important regulatory functions</article-subhead><article-text><p>Scientists have identified an RNA molecule with broad powers to regulate the body's inflammatory response to infection and injury. Called lincRNA-Cox2, it belongs to a recently discovered, highly abundant class of RNAs whose functions are only beginning to be understood.</p>
<p>The sequencing of the human genome revealed that only a small fraction of the DNA in our chromosomes comprises genes that encode instructions for making proteins. Those genes are transcribed into messenger RNA, which directs the synthesis of proteins that carry out various functions in the cell. The rest of the genome, about 98 percent of it, was sometimes referred to as the "dark matter" of the genome or dismissed as "junk DNA."</p>
<p>In the past decade, however, new RNA sequencing technologies have revealed that much of the genome is transcribed into noncoding RNA molecules of various types. Long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) is the largest class of these RNAs.</p>
<p>"We now know of about 16,000 long noncoding RNAs, about as many as there are protein-coding genes, but we know the functions of less than one percent of them," said Susan Carpenter, an assistant professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Carpenter's lab is interested in how lincRNAs control the processes involved in inflammation. The new study, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31603-6">published November 6 in <em>Cell Reports</em></a>, shows that lincRNA-Cox2 functions in several different ways to regulate the activity of genes involved in inflammation and other immune system responses.</p>
<p><strong>Inflammatory gene<br/></strong></p>
<p>Inflammation is a normal part of the body's response to infection and injury, but unresolved or chronic inflammation is associated with a wide range of diseases. LincRNA-Cox2 was named for its proximity in the genome to a gene called Cox2, which Carpenter calls "the most important inflammatory gene in the body." Aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation by inhibiting the Cox2 enzyme encoded by this gene.</p>
<p>One of the major findings of the new study is that lincRNA-Cox2 regulates the activity of this neighboring gene, boosting production of the enzyme. Carpenter's team found that levels of the Cox2 enzyme were 70 to 80 percent lower than normal in mice lacking the lincRNA-Cox2 gene.</p>
<p>But Cox2 is not the only gene regulated by lincRNA-Cox2. It also influences the expression of genes scattered all across the genome, and these other genes are important in the innate immune response to infections. LincRNA-Cox2 can inhibit some genes and enhance the expression of others. Previous work by Carpenter's lab and others had shown these effects in cell cultures, but the new study used genetically altered mice to tease out the effects of lincRNA-Cox2 on the neighboring Cox2 gene and on other immune system genes in live animals.</p>
<p>"We've now made animal models that show lincRNA-Cox2 is important in the whole organism, and this is probably one of the first examples to show a lincRNA controls not only a neighboring gene but other genes as well," Carpenter said.</p>
<p><strong>Viral infections</strong></p>
<p>One of the functions of lincRNA-Cox2 is to inhibit the expression of a number of genes that are important in the innate immune response to viral infections. "You want those genes to turn on when you have an infection, but when they get turned on in the absence of infection it's associated with autoimmune diseases like lupus," Carpenter said.</p>
<p>Carpenter's team also used the mouse models to investigate the expression of lincRNA-Cox2 in different tissues. They found, for example, that it is highly active in lung tissue, which suggests it may play a role in respiratory infections. In future work, the researchers plan to take a closer look at the activity of lincRNA-Cox2 in specific cell types.</p>
<p>"This field is so new, and there was a lot of skepticism at first, but we're now seeing that these lincRNAs are extremely important," Carpenter said. "It takes less energy for the cell to make an RNA than it does to make a protein, so it makes sense that a lot of regulatory molecules are RNAs."</p>
<p>Medical researchers are eager to understand the functions of these noncoding RNA molecules. With the explosive growth of genome sequencing, biomedical scientists have performed many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with diseases. But most of the disease-associated genetic variants found in these studies are not located in protein-coding genes.</p>
<p>"It turns out that 97 percent of them are in noncoding regions of the genome," Carpenter said. "That's one reason there is so much interest in these noncoding RNA genes."</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Adrienne Zihlman had a hunch 30 years ago that the study of human evolution would benefit from the analysis of more than skeletons. That hunch set her on a career path that established her as an internationally recognized authority on human origins.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, November 13, the public is invited to hear Zihlman, distinguished professor emerita of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, tell the tale of her research in a talk titled "The Inside Story of the Apes." The event begins at 7 p.m. in the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. Admission is free; doors open at 6:30 p.m. Complimentary parking is available in the Performing Arts Parking Lot.</p>
<p>Zihlman is an expert on the role of women in evolution, and her study of the anatomy of whole bodies&#8212;of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons&#8212;represents a major contribution to our understanding of human locomotion and chimpanzee models for the ape-human ancestor.</p>
<p>Zihlman's work combines evidence from ape genomes, geology, and the fossil record, as well as wild ape behavior and ecology. Her laboratory research on anatomy propelled her paradigm-shifting hypotheses about the time and place of human origins.</p>
<p>In the lab, Zihlman applied quantitative methods to study the bodies of apes that died of natural causes, recording all skin, muscles, bones, vessels, nerves, and connective tissue as she and her team of undergraduate students and researchers dissected each animal. The work was conducted in partnership with zoo and museum personnel, veterinarians, and, as Zihlman would say, "the apes themselves." By comparing individual animals of different species, ages, sexes, and body weights, Zihlman generated data never before available and made a lasting contribution to the study of primate anatomy and human evolution.</p>
<p>Zihlman authored <em>The Human Evolution Coloring Book</em> and coedited <em>The Evolving Female: A Life History Perspective</em>, which was based on a conference she organized at UC Santa Cruz. She is also the coauthor of the forthcoming book "Ape Anatomy and Evolution."</p>

<div><strong>UCSC Mentorship Concept</strong></div>
<div><strong>&#160;</strong></div>
<div>The UCSC SAB Staff Mentorship Program is a volunteer program that pairs experienced UCSC staff from all campus units with newer staff who are seeking to develop themselves professionally. The program provides a supportive structure in which participants can cultivate contacts, explore challenges, and enhance effectiveness as they design their personal growth and career paths at UCSC. It also provides the opportunity to gather information, develop peer support, learn more about the function of UCSC and better understand the UCSC organizational culture and opportunities.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Once pairs are set, mentors and mentees will define the shape and scope of their personal experience. Some pairs may chose more reading suggestions for example, where others may chose to rely exclusively on dialogue. The mentor relationship will officially run for one calendar year.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Program Cycles</strong></div>
<div><strong>&#160;</strong></div>
<div>The Staff Mentorship Program cycle runs 12 months. The next program cycle will run the calendar year from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019.&#160;&#160;There will be a process where mentors and mentees can meet, then mentees will interview several mentor possibilities, submit their preferences and be matched with a mentor. The mentor mix and match process should be complete by January 1st with the mentoring cycle running the 2019&#160;calendar year.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Who Can Participate</strong></div>
<div><strong>&#160;</strong></div>
<div>The program encompasses UCSC employees who are policy governed by Professional and Support Staff (PSS) and Managers and Senior Professionals (MSP).</div>
<div>Mentors are experienced UCSC career employees and well-respected advisors, coaches and colleagues that guide and challenge, and who are willing to share their experiences.</div>
<div>Mentees are UCSC career employees interested in career development and who have relatively fewer years of service.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Eligibility requirements for 2019 program participants include:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Non-represented staff in exempt and non-exempt (report time hourly) payroll titles governed by the Professional and Support Staff (PSS) or Manager and Senior Professional (MSP) policies</li>
<li>Supervisor approval</li>
<li>Non-probationary Career or partial-year Career status by the start of the mentee program with a current satisfactory (or better) performance evaluation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>&#160;Before applying, potential mentees should:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Obtain supervisor approval</li>
<li>Confirm their job classification with their Staff Human Resources Operations Specialist.&#160; A directory is available <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/contact/locate_team.html" moz-do-not-send="true">HERE</a>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How the Program Works<br/></strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Mentees accepted for the program will be notified shortly after the application deadline.&#160; Supervisor approval will be required in order to participate in the program.</li>
<li>The UCSC Staff Advisory Board will sponsor a networking event to launch the Mentorship Program cycle, at which time mentors and mentees can meet in an informal setting. Mentees and mentors will receive the date, time and location of this 'Program Kick-Off Reception' via email.</li>
<li>Mentees are then expected to arrange meetings in person or by phone with 3 potential mentors. After meeting, mentees and mentors will separately submit their match preferences in ranked order to the UCSC Staff Advisory Board Mentorship Committee. The committee will complete the matching process.</li>
<li>Once matching is completed, pairs will be notified and the mentoring process will begin January 1st, 2019.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Once matched, the mentor and the mentee establish mutually agreeable terms for the mentorship relationship. Mentors and mentees meet together on a established schedule for one calendar/fiscal year.</div>

<h3>Academic priority areas</h3>
Our <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/">academic priority areas</a> provide themes around which we will organize faculty research collaborations and initiatives. The APAs highlight where UC Santa Cruz does cutting-edge disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, and where we can, and do, lead the world. They also provide another means for faculty across all of our divisions to connect. While we may not have the ability, like some universities, to hire 20 faculty in a single area, we can have 20 faculty members in a range of disciplines whose work in an area is mutually supportive, which collectively elevates the impact of all their efforts. Moreover, when hiring in these areas, new faculty will enter with a group of colleagues from across the university who are poised to be potential partners. This amplification of our work internally and externally is the reason we will prioritize proposed hires that support one or more APAs.<br/><br/>Since my <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/10/sap-moving-forward.html">Oct. 5 update</a>, I have clarified the role of the APA <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/about-sap/#people">faculty leadership teams</a>. They have been asked to focus only on hiring, helping identify complementary faculty hires across disciplines, departments, and divisions to influence the decanal hiring requests that will be submitted in early winter quarter.<br/>
<h3>Academic oversight committee</h3>
The <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/about-sap/#people">Academic Oversight Committee</a>, a predominantly faculty group that grew from last year's Academic Advisory Committee, is planning to examine current efforts within their respective divisions that support the <a href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/design-principles/">SAP's Design Principles</a>. I want to recognize the great work that is already happening on our campus to support the principles that our faculty, staff, and students all enthusiastically supported.<br/>
<h3>SAP brochure</h3>
In the near future, and with the support of the Senate, I plan to distribute a brochure about our SAP design principles, academic priority areas, and barrier reduction. This brochure is meant to reach all faculty and staff, and will be a helpful and digestible overview of the plan and where we're headed. The SAP is a vision for our shared future, and we must all be engaged.<br/>
<h3>Caf&#233; SAP</h3>
I hope you'll join Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbie Lee at our next <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/cafe_sap_6198#.W-IL2KeZP5V">Caf&#233; SAP</a>, 8:30-9:30 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 14, in the Jack Baskin Engineering Courtyard. All interested faculty, staff, and students are invited to stop by, ask questions, or simply share their thoughts about the SAP. Please drop in!<br/>
<h3>Questions</h3>

But that's not the whole story.</p>
<p>A new report, "<a href="https://santacruzinstitute.ucsc.edu/news-publications/news-events/resistance_to_renewal.html">From Resistance to Renewal: A 12-Step Program for Innovation and Inclusion in the California Economy</a>," highlights a state of "haves" and "have nots":</p>
<ul>
<li>The Golden State ranks fourth among U.S. states in terms of income inequality.</li>
<li>Real median wages have flatlined since 1980&#8212;despite soaring worker productivity.</li>
<li>The ratio of black to white household income is lower today than it was in the early 1990s.</li>
<li>And the ratio of Latino to white household income has barely budged.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the report, coauthored by Chris Benner, professor of sociology and environmental studies and director of the <a href="https://santacruzinstitute.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz Institute for Social Transformation</a> at UC Santa Cruz, and Manuel Pastor, professor of sociology and director of the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/pere">Program for Environmental and Regional Equity</a> at the University of Southern California, the authors assert that California needs an economic "reboot" to promote innovation and inclusion within its own borders&#8212;and perhaps, as California often does, drag the nation kicking and screaming into a more equitable future, as well.</p>
<p>"The sad truth is that California, like the nation, is a state of 'haves' and 'have nots,' " said Benner. "This inequity belies our values. We have the resources to do better. This 12-step program outlines the way to get there."</p>
<p>The 12 steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting innovation</li>
<li>Addressing changes related to the aging of the population</li>
<li>Empowering workers</li>
<li>Encouraging lifelong learning</li>
<li>Promoting financial security</li>
<li>Supporting inland California</li>
<li>Ensuring the success of de-incarceration and re-entry</li>
<li>Embracing and integrating "immigrant California"</li>
<li>Increasing the supply of affordable housing</li>
<li>Improving transit systems for people and goods</li>
<li>Taking action on climate change</li>
<li>Aligning fiscal and governance systems to build an inclusive economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program is rooted in five tenets of current economic thinking, beginning with the understanding that today's levels of inequality are actually derailing prosperity, because equity is key to achieving sustainable growth.</p>
<p>In addition, racism must be rooted out of economic and social systems. "It's the right and socially just thing to do, as well as the economically smart thing to do, because we need to make full use of all our talents and focus on seeking economic common ground," said Benner.</p>
<p>Finally, protecting the planet and recognizing the aging of the population must be central to policy-making. "Climate change presents new opportunities for partnering with business, and demographic changes present an opportunity to build a 'caring economy' that supports elders, as well as the domestic workers and family members who care for them," he said.</p>

Roughly 75 personnel responded, with engine crews from Santa Cruz, Cal Fire, as well as the Aptos-La Selva, Branciforte, Central, Felton, and Scotts Valley fire departments. UC Santa Cruz police also responded.<br/><br/>Although there was heavy smoke on parts of UC Santa Cruz as a result of the fire, the cause of which remains under investigation, there was no threat to campus. Fire officials expect to wrap up their efforts later today, though fire crews may use campus fire roads over the next few days to access the area.<br/><br/>Those with respiratory issues are advised to take precautions, as smoke is possible on parts of campus and in the nearby area throughout the day.<br/><br/>Campus officials will continue to work closely with the fire department and local law enforcement agencies until the fire is contained.&#160;<br/><br/>For more information on fire preparedness, response and air quality, visit the university's <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/emergency-management/preparedness/procedures/fire.html">Office of Emergency Services Fire Procedures website</a>.<br/><br/>Santa Cruz County has been fortunate not to experience a major wildland fire in recent years, but this incident, as well as the nearby Rincon Fire a few days earlier, are reminders that we all must do our part to prevent them. The danger to our campus is real and potentially devastating, as current dry conditions have created an explosive environment. The campus fire-danger is currently rated extreme.<br/><br/>Anyone who smells smoke or sees a fire should immediately dial 911.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f07f9dd0807270172739340f00fdae5e"><name>auger-syrian-film</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SocDoc alumna’s film about Syrian women refugees to have world premiere at DOC NYC</title><summary>We Are Not Princesses, the first feature film by UC Santa Cruz alumna Bridgette Auger (SocDoc ’11) will have its world premiere on November 14 at DOC NYC, the largest documentary film festival in the United States.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz news, ucsc news, ucsc film alumni, bridgette auger, we are not princesses, ucsc soc doc</keywords><start-date>1541636100000</start-date><display-name>SocDoc alumna’s film about Syrian women refugees </display-name><path>/2018/11/auger-syrian-film</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/auger-syrian-film</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1541633186235</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1541636229302</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/289377851" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="640"></iframe>

<p>The film is about four Syrian women, living as refugees in Beirut, Lebanon, who come together to tell their personal stories of love, loss, despair, and hope through exploration of the ancient Greek play, <em>Antigone</em>.</p>
<p><em>We Are Not Princesses </em>was inspired by an eight-week theater workshop titled &#8220;Antigone of Syria&#8221; that was put together by the Open Art Foundation for Syrian women refugees in Lebanon. It was designed to help the women find community, heal, and process their trauma as a result of the ongoing war in Syria.</p>
<p>Shot over three months in the autumn of 2014, the film uses intimate footage and animation to show how these resilient women are picking up the pieces of their lives and putting them back together&#8212;despite the seemingly endless tragic conditions back home in Syria.</p>
<p>Auger directed and filmed the 75-minute documentary in collaboration with London-based Syrian filmmaker Itab Azzam.</p>
<p><strong>An artist and filmmaker committed</strong> to using art for social change, Auger received her Master&#8217;s degree in Social Documentation from UC Santa Cruz in 2011. Prior to that, she earned a degree in photography and imaging from New York University&#8217;s Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
<p>She has lived in the Middle East for several years, covering the Arab Spring in Egypt and Libya, as well as the refugee crisis from the conflict in Syria, through photography and video. Her work has taken her to a variety of other countries, including Iraqi Kurdistan, Kashmir, Mongolia, China, as well as the U.S.</p>
<p>Auger&#8217;s video of women on the front lines of protest at Egypt&#8217;s Tahrir Square in 2011 was featured on the <em>Daily Beast</em>. Two years later, her photos of Syrian refugees were displayed as &#8220;The Toll of Syria&#8217;s War&#8221; on the <em>CBS News</em> <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2300-202_162-10017460.html">web site</a>.</p>
<p>Her work has also appeared in <em>Syria Today, The Guardian, The New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, GlobalPost</em>, the <em>International Organization for Migration</em>, the&#160;<em>UN Refugee Agency</em>, and on <em>CNN.</em></p>
<p><em></em><strong><em>Created in 2010, DOC NYC</em></strong> showcases new achievements in documentary film, along with panels and conversations. The eight-day festival is based at the West Village&#8217;s IFC Center, Chelsea&#8217;s SVA Theater and Bow Tie Chelsea Cinema.</p>
<p>Described by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> as &#8220;an essential summit for all kinds of documentary filmmaking,&#8221; the festival will screen over 300 films this year and host more than 200 special guests.</p>
<p>Past guests have included <strong>Martin Scorsese, Michael Moore, Jim Carrey, Susan Sarandon, Oliver Stone, Jonathan Franzen, Michel Gondry</strong>, and <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, as well as notable attendees such as <strong>Rosario Dawson, Fred Armisen, Jim Jarmusch, Michael Stipe, Katie Couric, Russell Simmons, Darren Aronofsky, Cornel West</strong>, and <strong>Naomi Watts</strong>.</p>
<p>As <em>Indiewire</em> noted in 2015, &#8220;Bigger isn&#8217;t always better. But when it comes to DOC NYC, now the largest documentary film festival in the U.S., the five-year-old upstart event has proven itself a worthy new addition...By all accounts, screenings have been selling out; the country&#8217;s top documentary filmmakers, from Albert Maysles to D.A. Pennebaker, are showing up for tributes and events; and sales agents are closing deals on select world premieres.&#8221;<em></em></p>

<p>The first analysis of high-quality ancient DNA data from Central and South America&#8212;from 49 individuals, some as old as 11,000 years&#8212;has revealed a major and previously unappreciated early population turnover.</p>
<p>The study, "<em>Reconstructing the Deep Population History of Central and South America</em>," was conducted by an international team that included researchers from the University of California, Santa Cruz, Harvard Medical School, and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. Their results show that a distinctive DNA type associated with the first widespread archaeological culture of North America (Clovis) was also found in Chile, Brazil, and Belize 9,000-11,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that the people who spread the Clovis culture also had a major demographic impact further south. But this Clovis culture-associated lineage is missing in later South Americans, documenting a continent-wide population replacement that began at least 9,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The researchers worked closely with indigenous communities and government agencies to obtain permits for analyzing these ancient human remains. The genomic data analyzed previously were less than 1,000 years old.</p>
<p>"A key discovery was that a Clovis culture-associated individual from North America dating to around 12,800 years ago shares distinctive ancestry with the oldest Chilean, Brazilian, and Belizean individuals," explained co-lead author Cosimo Posth of the Planck Institute. "This supports the hypothesis that the expansion of people who spread the Clovis culture in North America also reached Central and South America."</p>
<p>These individuals from Chile, Brazil and Belize date to more than 9,000 years ago. However, younger individuals and present-day people in South America do not share the Clovis culture-associated ancestry that characterizes the oldest individuals.</p>
<p>"This is our second key discovery," said co-senior author David Reich from Harvard Medical School and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. "We have shown that there was a continent-wide population replacement that began at least 9,000 years ago."</p>
<p>After the population replacement, there was striking genetic continuity between ancient individuals dating to up to 9,000 years ago and modern people from multiple South American regions. This contrasts with West Eurasia and Africa, where there are few places with such long-standing continuity.</p>
<p><em>California Channel Island-associated ancestry in the Andes</em></p>
<p>The second previously unknown spread of people revealed itself in an analysis showing that ancient Californians from the Channel Islands have a distinctive shared ancestry with groups that became widespread in the southern Peruvian Andes by at least 4,200 years ago.</p>
<p>"This is unlikely to reflect migration specifically from the Channel Islands into South America," said co-senior author Lars Fehren-Schmitz, an associate professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz. Instead, the researchers hypothesize that the connection between these regions is the result of dispersals of people that occurred thousands of years earlier, and that such ancestry became more widespread in the Andes after subsequent events within South America.</p>
<p>"It could be that this ancestry arrived in South America thousands of years before and we simply don&#8217;t have earlier individuals showing it," said Nathan Nakatsuka of Harvard Medical School, co-lead author of the study. "There is archaeological evidence that the population in the Central Andes area greatly expanded after around 5,000 years ago. Spreads of particular subgroups during these events may be why we detect this ancestry afterward."</p>
<p><em>The promise of ancient DNA research in the Americas</em></p>
<p>The researchers emphasize that their study gives only a glimpse of the discoveries that may come through future work. To learn about the initial movements of people into Central and South America, it would be necessary to obtain ancient DNA from individuals dating to before 11,000 years ago. The picture is far from complete even for the period between 11,000 and 3,000 years ago that is covered in this study.</p>
<p>"We lacked ancient data from Amazonia, northern South America and the Caribbean, and thus cannot determine how individuals in these regions relate to the ones we analyzed," explained Reich. "Filling in these gaps should be a priority for future work."</p>
<p>"We are excited about the potential of research in this area," stated co-senior author Johannes Krause of the Planck Institute. "With future, regionally focused studies with large sample sizes, we could realize the potential of ancient DNA to reveal how the human diversity of this region came to be the way it is today."</p>
<p>The team also included researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the University of New Mexico, the University of S&#227;o Paulo, and other institutions in Australia, Brazil, Belize, Chile, Argentina, Peru, the European Union, and the United States.</p>

<p>Last January, the Interior Department announced its intention to allow drilling in nearly all U.S. waters, the largest expansion of offshore oil and gas leasing ever proposed by the federal government. This would include nearly every coastline in the nation, putting regions that were long off limits to oil and gas development back on the table. While it&#8217;s unlikely that drilling would ever be allowed in the Monterey Bay, production anywhere along California&#8217;s coast is risky. From additional tanker traffic to an actual spill in neighboring waters, potential hazards abound.</p>
<p>Is there oil and gas off our coast? Where is it and how much is there? How feasible is production along California&#8217;s coast today? Who makes the final decisions? The expert panelists will drill deeper into the science and policy of offshore oil and gas production along California&#8217;s coast.</p>
<p>The 2018 Ken Norris Memorial Lecture will be moderated by Kate Roberts, president of the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership. The panelists will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Douros, West Coast Regional Director, Office of National Marine Sanctuaries</li>
<li>Kaitilin Gaffney, Ocean, Coast, and Fisheries Director, Resource Legacy Fund</li>
<li>Gary Griggs, Distinguished Professor of Earth Sciences, UC Santa Cruz</li>
</ul>
<p>The event is hosted by Pete Raimondi, director of the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Marine Sciences, and sponsored by Naomi Kirschenbaum.</p>
<p>The Kenneth Norris Memorial Lecture is named after acclaimed scientist, naturalist, teacher, and conservationist Kenneth S. Norris. Norris was a professor of natural history at UC Santa Cruz for 18 years. His legacy includes helping to found UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Long Marine Laboratory and the campus's Institute of Marine Sciences. He is nationally known for his pioneering research with dolphins and his efforts to establish the University of California&#8217;s Natural Reserve System. He was a key author of the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.</p>

Written over the past 15 years, it&#8217;s a linked collection of engaging tales about the same people--all set in Santa Cruz, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;The title of the book is very much on the nose,&#8221; said Perks. &#8220;It's exactly what the collection is about--people longing for true love, for transcendent, passionate, connection, and at the same time longing for an escape, for freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, true love is a miraculous escape, escape from our mundane existence,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It's as much a transformative experience as a religious conversion, a drug trip, or a near death event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perks noted that each story stands alone, but together &#8220;they create an arch, like a novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It's really important to me that people read the stories in order,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;It's chronological, and you slowly find out what happens to each of the main characters.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>"The stories in <em>True Love</em></strong> connect in the most satisfying way,&#8221; observed David Vann, author of <em>Bright Air Black</em> and <em>Aquarium</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;You begin with a journalist who interviewed Harry Houdini about his night with lost souls in the Winchester House, a light story that gains weight from the six million Jews who did not escape," said Vann. "Then you have the chance to follow his granddaughter in her sad affair with a lover from Chile, a legacy. The stories are about escape in the deepest ways, from marriage and family and self and even from time and place, and the writing is beautiful, believable, disorienting. Sit down and watch the show, because I guarantee you don't know what's coming&#8230;"</p>
<p>Co-director of the Literature Department&#8217;s creative writing program at UC Santa Cruz, Perks is currently wrapping up a fall tour to promote the book that ends in December with a reading at Powell's Books in Portland.</p>
<p>Her previous works include two novels,&#160;<em>What Becomes Us </em>(2016) and<em> We Are Gathered Here;</em> a memoir,&#160;<em>Pagan Time</em>; and a long personal essay,&#160;<em>Alone in the Woods: Cheryl Strayed, My Daughter and Me</em>.</p>
<p>Her short stories and essays have won five Pushcart Prize nominations, and her work has appeared in anthologies and journals such as&#160;<em>Epoch, Zyzzyva, Tin House, The Toast,</em>&#160;<em>The Rumpus, and </em><em>The Best Underground Fiction, Santa Cruz Noir.</em></p>
<p><em></em>&#8220;I hope I make readers laugh, and give them a sense of possibility, of hope, a little respite from these exhausting times,&#8221; said Perks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last story is called 'Refugium.' A refugium is a place where an organism can survive during inhospitable periods. I'd like to think of my book as a brief refugium.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My next book is about utopia and apocalypse. I'm writing a memoir-essay about women and girls in utopian/apocalyptic situations--both in life and in literature,&#8221; she added.</p>

He was 75.</p>
<p>A leading endocrinologist, Talamantes joined the UCSC faculty in 1974 and served as vice provost and dean of graduate studies from 2000 to 2004. After retiring from UC Santa Cruz in 2004, Talamantes moved to his hometown of El Paso, where he joined the faculty of Texas Tech El Paso School of Medicine as a professor and assistant dean for research in 2005.</p>
<p>Talamantes received numerous awards and honors for his pioneering research on reproductive hormones and hormone receptors, and he was also recognized for his leadership on issues of minority education. A founding member of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), he served as president of SACNAS from 1987 to 1990. The American Association for Higher Education honored him for "outstanding leadership and contributions to education in the Hispanic community," and in 1998 he was named as one of the "100 Most Influential Hispanics" by <em>Hispanic Business</em> magazine.</p>
<p>In his research, Talamantes studied a family of hormones called placental lactogens and the growth hormone receptor, which play crucial roles during pregnancy. His lab elucidated the structures of these proteins and their genes, and investigated the factors controlling their expression during pregnancy. He also studied the effects of placental lactogens on target organs such as the mammary glands and investigated their role in breast cancer susceptibility.</p>
<p>Talamantes received his B.A. in biology from the University of St. Thomas in Houston, and his M.A. in biology from Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. He earned his Ph.D. in endocrinology from UC Berkeley in 1974.</p>
<p>Talamantes is survived by two daughters, Margaret and Laura Talamantes, and three grandchildren. A celebration of his life will be held in El Paso on Saturday, December 1.

Understanding how these neural circuits operate in complex natural settings, however, has been a challenge.</p>
<p>A new study led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries overcame this challenge using a clever experimental design to record and analyze escape responses in coral reef fish. The results, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1809140115">published November 12 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, reveal how a sequence of well-defined decision rules generates evasion behavior in a wide range of coral reef fish species.</p>
<p>"We took an approach used in laboratory studies into a complex, natural environment and found that the same behavioral mechanisms seem to apply. A set of simple rules are combined in different ways to generate a rich suite of behaviors to accomplish this fundamental goal: to avoid being killed," said first author Andrew Hein, an assistant researcher at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Marine Sciences and research ecologist at the NOAA Fisheries Lab in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The coral reef fish in the study feed on algae in shallow reef flats, where they are vulnerable to predators such as moray eels and reef sharks. To simulate a threat, the researchers employed a widely used visual stimulus called the looming stimulus, a black dot that grows in size slowly and then rapidly, creating the illusion of a rapidly approaching object. A waterproof tablet computer deployed on a coral reef in Mo'orea, French Polynesia, played the looming stimulus, while video cameras recorded the responses of fish that swam into the area in front of the tablet.</p>
<p>The researchers then used computer vision technology to analyze the video. Automated tracking and a method known as "ray casting," originally developed by video game designers, allowed them to reconstruct what each fish was seeing as it decided whether or not to flee from the threat. They found that fish initiated escape maneuvers in response to the perceived size and expansion rate of the threat stimulus using a decision rule that matched the dynamics of known loom-sensitive neural circuits.</p>
<p>"This same behavioral circuit that neuroscientists identified in lab studies seems to be operating in the more complex natural environment," Hein said. "But we also found something new: the sensitivity to the looming stimulus gets tuned up or down depending on the locations of other fish. If an individual is the closest one to the stimulus, it is much more likely to flee than if there is another fish between it and the threat."</p>
<p>A third factor in the escape response was the location of a safe place to shelter, offered by a mounding coral alongside the experimental area. The initial response to the stimulus is to quickly turn away from the threat, but almost immediately the fish then began turning toward the shelter and swam directly toward it.</p>
<p>"When you look at the paths they take, it looks like spaghetti--they're all different--but the analysis shows they're all generated by the same simple set of behavioral rules," Hein said.</p>
<p>In addition to Hein, the coauthors of the paper include Michael Gil, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz, Colin Twomey at the University of Pennsylvania, Iain Couzin at the Max Planck Institute and the University of Konstanz, Germany, and Simon Levin at Princeton University.

<p>Quadri was one of nearly 90 student speakers who delivered 15-minute presentations about their research during the conference, which is organized by the museum's <a href="https://www.amnh.org/our-research/center-for-biodiversity-conservation/about-the-cbc">Center for Biodiversity and Conservation</a>.</p>
<p>In his talk, "Natural History in the Age of Climate Change," Quadri shared his fascination with the biodiversity of trees in the tropical mountains of Mexico. Quadri's natural-science research focuses on the impacts of climate change on high-elevation tropical trees. During his talk, he described studying the growth rings of trees to explore changes in growth patterns and tree distribution over 150 years.</p>
<p>"I love mountains, and tropical mountains are the most biodiverse places on the planet," said Quadri. "The growth rings are an open book that tells how a tree has changed over time."</p>
<p>Using sophisticated techniques, Quadri is able to study growth rings, "pick a year," and learn from the trees whether that year was warm, cold, wet, dry, or heavily polluted. "You can travel back in time by studying them," he said. "You can identify growth shifts by habitat, and learn why those shifts were happening."</p>
<p>The effects of climate change are hidden in trees, he added. Trees that used to grow well on a warm, south-facing slope may no longer thrive as overall temperatures increase, while warmer temps may give a boost to trees growing on cooler, north-facing slopes. Monitoring and understanding those changes, and how they impact the distribution of trees and species, offers clues to for conservationists.</p>
<p>"When you go out as an ecologist and detect these patterns, you're seeing history in the making. It's important to know where these mountain <em>refugia</em> are going to develop in the future to help us preserve species and protect biodiversity," he said, using a&#160;<span>Latin technical term for habitats where species can persist under adverse climate conditions.</span></p>
<p>Quadri gave his talk before a crowd of 200 or so conference attendees. He said his adviser, biology professor Erika Zavaleta, has been a great mentor. "She's really supportive and good at giving public talks," he said, adding, with a laugh, "I didn't know there were going to be judges at the conference&#8212;which probably was a good thing."</p>

<p>The team, led by Ignasi Ribas of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia and the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona, used data gathered by various groups over some 20 years of observations, including new observations with the CARMENES planet-hunter spectrograph at Calar Alto, Spain, and other facilities.</p>
<p>The results, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0677-y">published November 14 in <em>Nature</em></a>, provide significant evidence of a planet with mass just over three times Earth's mass (a "super-Earth" planet) orbiting the red dwarf star every 233 days. This would place the new planet at the so-called snow-line of the star, where it is likely to be a frozen world.</p>
<p>Steven Vogt, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said his exoplanet search team began observing Barnard's star in 1997 using the HIRES spectrometer (which Vogt designed) at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The gravitational tug of an orbiting planet causes periodic changes in the radial velocity of the host star (its motion along the line of sight from Earth), which can be detected with precision spectrometers.</p>
<p>"We followed Barnard's star for 16 long years at Keck, amassing some 260 precision radial velocities of Barnard's star by 2013," Vogt said. "In 2016, our European colleague Mikko Tuomi combined our HIRES data with publicly available data from the Europeans' UVES and HARPS spectrometers and began to see faint hints of a 230-day periodicity in the radial velocity data, indicative of a possible Earth-sized planet."</p>
<p>At that time, however, the signal was still too weak for the astronomers to claim it as significant and publish their findings. Redoubling their efforts, they added 45 more radial velocity measurements from the newly commissioned Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope at UC's Lick Observatory, 39 velocities from the Carnegie Institution for Science's Planet Finder Spectrometer (PFS) on the Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, and more data that became publicly available in recent years from HARPS. In each case, the additional data made the roughly 230-day signal grow stronger and more significant.</p>
<p><strong>Final push</strong></p>
<p>The final push came when European astronomers led by Ribas decided to observe Barnard's star intensively with CARMENES, a new instrument that began observations in 2016. CARMENES observed Barnard's star 177 times from 2016 to 2017 in an intensive observing campaign aimed at confirming the suspected planet.</p>
<p>"The additional data from CARMENES strongly confirmed the signal, and removed any lingering doubt as to the reality of this planet," Vogt said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the analysis, we used observations from seven different instruments, spanning 20 years, making this one of the largest and most extensive datasets ever used for precise radial velocity studies. The combination of all data led to a total of 771 measurements,&#8221; Ribas explained.</p>
<p>A clear signal at a period of 233 days arose again in a re-analysis of all the measurements combined. This signal implies that Barnard&#8217;s star is approaching and moving away from us at about 1.2 meters per second&#8212;approximately the walking speed of a person&#8212;and this motion is best explained as the result of a planet orbiting the star.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a very careful analysis, we are over 99 percent confident that the planet is there, since this is the model that best fits our observations,&#8221; said Ribas. &#8220;However, we must remain cautious and collect more data to nail the case in the future, because natural variations of the stellar brightness can produce similar effects to the ones detected.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up observations</strong></p>
<p>Follow-up observations of Barnard's star are already happening at different observatories. According to Vogt, the current data can rule out the presence of Jupiter-sized giant planets closer to the star, but there may be additional planets smaller than Earth-mass orbiting closer in that have not yet been detected.</p>
<p>At only six light-years from us, Barnard&#8217;s star has the largest apparent velocity on Earth&#8217;s sky of any star. Smaller and older than our sun, it is among the least active red dwarfs known and represents an ideal target to search for exoplanets with various methods.</p>
<p>"It is the most common type of star in the galaxy&#8212;over 70 percent of Milky Way stars are like this dim, M dwarf star," Vogt said. "Because of its extreme closeness, Barnard's star has long commanded an outsized fascination among early hopeful exoplanet prospectors, yet it is too faint be seen with the naked eye."</p>
<p>The planet, named Barnard&#8217;s star b (or GJ 699 b), is a super-Earth with a minimum of 3.2 Earth masses. It orbits its cool red parent star every 233 days near the snow-line, a distance where water would be frozen. In the absence of an atmosphere, its temperature is likely to be about -150 &#186;C, which makes it unlikely that the planet can support liquid water on its surface. However, its characteristics make it an excellent target for direct imaging using the next generation of instruments.</p>
<p>Exoplanets so small and so far away from their parent star have not been discovered before using the radial velocity technique. This means that astronomers are getting better at finding these kinds of planets outside our solar system.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all have worked very hard on this result,&#8221; said Guillem Anglada-Escude at Queen Mary University of London and co-leader of this work. &#8220;This is the result of a large collaboration organized in the context of the Red Dots project, which is why it has contributions from teams all over the world including semi-professional astronomers coordinated by the AAVSO.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0e57b625807270172739340f0e0a4e12"><name>beyond-compliance-opportunities</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New opportunities for faculty to engage with Beyond Compliance initiative</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz faculty members have two new opportunities to help eliminate sexual harassment and sexual violence on campus.</summary><start-date>1542096000000</start-date><display-name>Beyond Compliance</display-name><path>/2018/11/beyond-compliance-opportunities</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/beyond-compliance-opportunities</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1542133887456</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1542133887456</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Lisa Renner</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/beyond-compliance-fall-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/beyond-compliance-fall-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beyond-compliance-fall-500px.jpg</name><display-name>beyond-compliance-fall-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>279616</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Students walking on campus</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/beyond-compliance-fall-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/beyond-compliance-fall-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beyond-compliance-fall-80px.jpg</name><display-name>beyond-compliance-fall-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>16043</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Students walking on campus</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Beyond Compliance is requesting proposals for new courses now with rolling deadlines scheduled Dec. 14, March 15, and June 14.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz faculty members have two new opportunities to help eliminate sexual harassment and sexual violence on campus.</p>
<p>They can apply for course release to develop and teach a new course related to these issues. They can also join a faculty learning community in winter quarter to discuss how to incorporate a unit about sexual harassment and sexual violence into an existing course.</p>
<p>Both efforts are part of the <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond-compliance/">Beyond Compliance initiative</a> which has the lofty goal of ending sexual harassment and sexual violence from the campus. The idea is to shift the conversation from what is the minimum needed to comply with the law to a higher plane of how the university can best create a safe environment for all.</p>
<p>Jody Greene, associate vice provost for Teaching and Learning, who is assisting with the effort, said the initiative is an important step to change the campus climate. Laws alone clearly don&#8217;t work as the problems keep persisting, she said. In her mind, sexual violence and harassment do not exclusively stem from individual bad actors, but derive from cultural and structural inequities related to gender and sexuality that allow victimization to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the &#8216;Beyond Compliance&#8217; framework as the most promising framework for dealing with all the structural violence and inequalities that we live with,&#8221; Greene said.</p>
<h3>Course proposals requested</h3>
<p>Beyond Compliance is requesting <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond-compliance/Initiatives/index.html">proposals for new courses</a> now with rolling deadlines scheduled Dec. 14, March 15, and June 14. Faculty from all disciplines are encouraged to apply. Some examples of possible courses include the history of legal understandings of consent, sexual violence in western art, or the neuroscience of trauma. An engineering class could develop a socially responsible game about bystander interventions or a statistics class could use data on sexual harassment incidents.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could expand understanding of what constitutes sexual harassment, sexual violence, and gender discrimination,&#8221; said Kimberly Lau, a literature professor who is co-chair of Beyond Compliance. &#8220;What are the cultures around these things? What is the research exploring these topics? If we could bring more discussion about these topics into our curriculum, that would be a productive way to expand the conversation and thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>To fully integrate new courses into the undergraduate curriculum, the department chair will have to commit to offer the new class twice in the next three years.</p>
<h3>New faculty learning community</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/beyond-compliance/Documents/bc_cfp_flp_2018-19.pdf">new learning community</a> is intended to provide support for faculty members interested in integrating a unit on sexual violence and harassment into their already existing courses. It will meet four times and will be organized in a way that allows participants to design and workshop possible new units. The deadline to apply to participate is Nov. 16.</p>
<p>Alison Hanson, a doctoral student in anthropology and graduate student researcher with Beyond Compliance, plans to start a similar graduate student learning community in the spring.</p>
<p>Greene, who directs the university&#8217;s Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning and is assisting with the faculty learning community, said it&#8217;s a shift for the center, which usually concentrates on pedagogical challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is different in that it&#8217;s content based,&#8221; she said, but also raises important pedagogical questions and potential risks for instructors who will be incorporating these units into their courses. &#8220;We are thinking about how to be as skillful as we can in teaching these topics, because we want people to feel supported in taking the chance to talk about sexual harassment and sexual violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>While faculty members need training in the law on sexual harassment and sexual violence, Greene thinks they also need to explore how these problems surface in their courses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to come at this from the roots, in addition to what you can see above the ground,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Classrooms are places where we look at what&#8217;s happening in the roots.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0e5d3c4d807270172739340f4eb92e1e"><name>solar-parking-lot</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Solar panels, storage system to further campus sustainability</title><summary>The solar photovoltaic canopy and battery storage system will help provide the campus with clean, reliable electricity for at least 20-years and save the campus an estimated $6 million on its energy bill.</summary><start-date>1542096000000</start-date><display-name>Solar energy</display-name><path>/2018/11/solar-parking-lot</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/solar-parking-lot</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1542134249349</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1542134249349</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/solar-east-remote-500px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/solar-east-remote-500px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>solar-east-remote-500px.jpg</name><display-name>solar-east-remote-500px.jpg</display-name><file-size>206603</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Cars parked in the East Remote lot</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/solar-east-remote-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/solar-east-remote-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>solar-east-remote-80px.jpg</name><display-name>solar-east-remote-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14379</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The 2017&#8211;2022 Campus Sustainability Plan calls on UC Santa Cruz to develop a plan to add four megawatts of solar photovoltaic to the campus.&#160;</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In an effort to reduce the campus&#8217;s carbon footprint, a two-megawatt solar parking canopy and energy storage system will be built at the East Remote Parking Lot at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The solar photovoltaic canopy and battery storage system will help provide the campus with clean, reliable electricity for at least 20-years and save the campus an estimated $6 million on its energy bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advancing campus sustainability requires campuswide collaboration,&#8221; said Traci Ferdolage, associate vice chancellor for Physical Planning, Development and Operations. &#8220;This project is an example of what can be done when we work together toward a common goal&#8212;developing sustainable solutions to support our mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>The project will generate more than three million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, enough to power more than 330 houses for a year, according to EPA calculations. Construction is scheduled to start in 2019.</p>
<p>In addition to providing on-site solar energy, the project will allow the campus to store 1.2 megawatts of energy to reduce peak demand and shift load to times of day when electricity is less costly. The intelligent use of energy from the storage units combined with on-site solar energy generation helps maximize clean energy generation and enhance on-site sustainability.</p>
<p>The campus has partnered with ForeFront Power for the project through a streamlined procurement process offered by the School Project for Utility Rate Reduction, part of the Utilities Joint Powers Authority of California Public Schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is exciting to see our program extended to the University of California at Santa Cruz so that more public organizations can benefit from the saved time, effort, and money by using our procurement process,&#8221; said Michael Rochman, Managing Director of SPURR. &#8220;SPURR strives to offer clear, fair, and competitively-sourced terms and conditions that allow for easy sourcing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2017&#8211;2022 Campus Sustainability Plan calls on UC Santa Cruz to develop a plan to add four megawatts of solar photovoltaic to the campus. Additionally, the campus&#8212;as part of a systemwide initiative&#8212;will be carbon neutral by 2025.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz currently has a 250 kilowatt photovoltaic array on the McHenry Library, which provides 25 percent of the annual electrical energy needed for the building. It also provides 75 to 100 percent of the power needed for the building during peak times of year.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0e649130807270172739340f9cf0e395"><name>keynote-stars</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Showcasing our sustainability</title><summary>The campus, through the Sustainability Office, is in the midst of collecting information to submit for our 2019 report to the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS). </summary><start-date>1542096000000</start-date><display-name>Sustainability reporting</display-name><path>/2018/11/keynote-stars</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/keynote-stars</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1542134729780</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1542134729780</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elida Erickson</name><title></title><phone/><email>ekericks@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/elida-keynote.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/elida-keynote.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>elida-keynote.jpg</name><display-name>elida-keynote.jpg</display-name><file-size>59457</file-size><width>250</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt>Elida Erickson</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sustainability is a defining value of UC Santa Cruz, and we want to do all we can to accurately represent how this commitment is reflected in our scholarship, research, construction projects, and energy management.</p>
<p>The campus, through the <a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/">Sustainability Office</a>, is in the midst of collecting information to submit for our 2019 report to the <a href="https://stars.aashe.org/">Sustainability Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS)</a>.</p>
<p>STARS is a self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to gauge relative progress toward sustainability. The data we provide also form the basis for some rankings, most notably Sierra magazine&#8217;s Cool Schools list.</p>
<p>Under our 2016 report, UC Santa Cruz was <a href="https://stars.aashe.org/institutions/university-of-california-santa-cruz-ca/report/2016-03-23/">awarded a gold ranking</a> by STARS, a notable achievement, yet one still below the highest possible&#8212;platinum. The campus earned good marks in many categories&#8212;water, research, grounds&#8212;and we see enormous potential in focusing on the curriculum category, where we previously earned 24 out of 40 points.</p>
<p>In an effort to ensure that UC Santa Cruz is recognized as the environmental leader we know it to be, we are requesting the assistance of academic departments in identifying sustainability courses, learning outcomes, and research at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Sustainability courses are not as narrowly defined as one might think, and can be counted for STARS reporting if they examine more than one of the following: social well-being, economic prosperity, or environmental health.</p>
<p>We have reached out to campus deans to encourage departments to help provide the best possible data by the Dec. 15 deadline. We must submit the campus report to STARS early next year.</p>
<p>I appreciate everyone&#8217;s help in sharing information with our office so that we can showcase all the work done in and out of the classroom to promote sustainability.</p>
<p>I invite all interested members of our campus community to learn more about STARS and key campus sustainability priorities for this year at the second annual <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/2nd_annual_campus_sustainability_plan_kick-off_event#.W-sbC3pKiL6">Campus Sustainability Plan Kick-Off</a> event, from 3&#8211;5 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 29 at at Arboretum Horticulture II.

The supernova, called a type Ic, is thought to detonate after its massive progenitor star has shed or been stripped of its outer layers of hydrogen and helium.</p>
<p>These stars could be among the most massive known, at least 30 times heftier than our Sun. Even after shedding some of their material late in life, they are expected to be big and bright. So it was a mystery why astronomers had not been able to nab one of these stars in pre-explosion images.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2017, astronomers got lucky. A nearby star ended its life as a type Ic supernova. Two teams of astronomers poured through the archive of Hubble images to uncover the putative progenitor in pre-explosion photos taken in 2006. The supernova, catalogued as SN 2017ein, appeared near the center of the nearby galaxy spiral NGC 3938, located roughly 65 million light-years away.</p>
<p>This potential discovery could yield insight into stellar evolution, including how the masses of stars are distributed when they are born in batches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were fortunate that the supernova was nearby and very bright, about five to 10 times brighter than other type Ic supernovas, which may have made the progenitor easier to find,&#8221; said Charles Kilpatrick, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and leader of one of the teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finding a bona fide progenitor of a supernova Ic is a big prize of progenitor searching,&#8221; said Schuyler Van Dyk of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, lead researcher of the other team. &#8220;We now have for the first time a clearly-detected candidate object.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Van Dyk team&#8217;s paper was published in June in the <em>Astrophysical Journal</em>. The paper by Kilpatrick's team, which appeared in the July issue of the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/480/2/2072/5061638"><em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em></a>, is consistent with the earlier team&#8217;s conclusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Astronomers have observed many type Ic supernovas, but they are all too far away for Hubble to resolve,&#8221; Kilpatrick said. &#8220;You need one of these massive, bright stars in a nearby galaxy to go off. It looks like most type Ic supernova progenitors are less massive and therefore less bright, and that&#8217;s the reason we haven&#8217;t been able to find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>An analysis of the object&#8217;s colors shows that the candidate is extremely luminous and very hot and blue. Based on that assessment, both teams suggest two possibilities for the source&#8217;s identity. The progenitor could be a single hefty star between 45 and 55 solar masses or a massive binary star system in which one of the stars weighs between 60 and 80 solar masses and the other roughly 48 solar masses. In this scenario, the stars are orbiting closely and interact with each other. The more massive star is stripped of its hydrogen and helium layers, eventually exploding as a supernova.</p>
<p>The possibility of a massive double-star system is a surprise. &#8220;This is not what we would expect from current models, which call for lower-mass interacting binary progenitor systems,&#8221; Van Dyk said.</p>
<p>But the nature of the progenitors of type Ic supernovas has been a puzzle. Astronomers have known that the supernovas were deficient in hydrogen and helium, and initially proposed that some hefty stars shed this material in a strong wind (a stream of charged particles) before they exploded. When they didn&#8217;t find the progenitor stars, which should have been extremely massive and bright, they suggested a second method to produce the exploding stars. An interaction between a pair of lower-mass binary stars would mean the one star stripped hydrogen and helium layers from the companion star. By gobbling up material from its companion, the more massive star would evolve faster and end its life in a supernova blast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disentangling these two scenarios for producing type Ic supernovas impacts our understanding of stellar evolution and star formation, including how the masses of stars are distributed when they are born to how many stars form in interacting binary systems,&#8221; explained Ori Fox of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland, a member of Van Dyk&#8217;s team. &#8220;And that is one of the questions that not just astronomers studying supernovas want to know but all astronomers are after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Type Ic supernovas are just one class of exploding star. They account for 21 percent of massive stars that explode from the collapse of their cores.</p>
<p>The teams caution that they won&#8217;t be able to confirm the source&#8217;s identity until the supernova fades in about two years. The astronomers hope to use either Hubble or the upcoming NASA James Webb Space Telescope to see whether the candidate progenitor star has disappeared or has significantly dimmed. They also will be able to separate the progenitor star&#8217;s light from that of stars in its environment to calculate a more accurate measurement of the object&#8217;s brightness and mass.</p>
<p>SN 2017ein was discovered in May 2017 by Tenagra Observatories in Arizona. But it took the sharp resolution of Hubble to pinpoint the exact location of the possible source. Van Dyk&#8217;s team imaged the young supernova in June 2017 with Hubble&#8217;s Wide Field Camera 3. The astronomers used the Hubble image to pinpoint the candidate progenitor star nestled in the host galaxy&#8217;s spiral arm in archival Hubble photos taken in October 2006 by the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick&#8217;s group observed the supernova also in June 2017 in infrared images with one of the 10-meter telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The team then turned to the Hubble archive to uncover a pre-explosion photo showing the possible source taken in December 2007 with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2.</p>
<p>In addition to Kilpatrick, the coauthors of the paper include Ryan Foley, Tyler Takaro, Camille Leibler, Yen-Chen Pan, Claire Max, and Sophia Medallon at UC Santa Cruz; Randall Campbell, Hilton Lewis, and James Lyke at the W. M. Keck Observatory; and Armin Rest at the Space Telescope Science Institute.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0f69560f807270172739340ffa7885ca"><name>photo-contest-winners</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2018 photo contest winners</title><summary>There were over 100 entries this year in the chancellor's holiday photo contest.

Webster Jr., whose philanthropy helped shape UC Santa Cruz, died peacefully November 10, 2018. He was 90.<br/><br/>Will&#8217;s company, Webster Laboratories, engineered and manufactured heart catheters, among them a device that enabled doctors to diagnose and treat a life-limiting condition in an outpatient procedure. Building on his company&#8217;s success, he established the Helen and Will Webster Foundation, which has made many significant grants to educational and health care causes, including numerous gifts benefitting UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>&#8220;Will Webster created a flourishing business improving the lives of cardiac patients. Then he continued changing the world through the good works of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;He is an inspiration to aspiring engineers and entrepreneurs, and our campus is forever grateful to him and his family for their generosity, which has led to transformative changes for our university community.&#8221; <br/><br/>Alec Webster (Rachel Carson &#8217;02, environmental studies) said it was important to his father to help people through both his engineering and his generosity. When the Helen and Will Webster Foundation started, it prioritized educational causes.<br/><br/>&#8220;He believed you can&#8217;t make an informed decision if you don&#8217;t understand the world,&#8221; Alec Webster said. &#8220;He read a lot. He loved music and art. He was pretty well rounded and he believed other people needed to be, too.&#8221;<br/>
<h3>Native engineer</h3>
Wilton Wells Webster Jr. was born January 29, 1928, in Pasadena. His father was an attorney who seems to have regretted not pursuing engineering and encouraged Will&#8217;s curiosity in the workshop. <br/><br/>Will earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering at Caltech. In 1948, while still a student, he married Helen E. Miller. <br/><br/>He began his career as a mechanical engineer designing oil refinery machinery. He later sold electronic devices to the aerospace industry. In the late 1960s, with his kitchen as his production area, he began working with Dr. William Ganz to add sensors to heart catheters. Soon he was able to rent a workspace and establish Wilton Webster Laboratories, incorporated later as Webster Laboratories.<br/><br/>In an autobiographical passage in <em>The Road to Scientific Success: Inspiring Life Stories of Prominent Researchers</em>, Will describes the great satisfaction he felt in this work. <br/><br/>&#8220;There was no one else but me to fall back on. Surprisingly, the enthusiasm that I had for this undertaking and the challenge to succeed made that easy. I loved the work and my personal freedom.&#8221;<br/><br/>Webster put an enormous amount of effort into the business, to the exclusion of some customary relaxation activities. &#8220;It is easy to find 60 to 70 productive hours in a week if you don&#8217;t watch television,&#8221; he wrote. <br/>
<h3>Growing a family business</h3>
His sons Alec and Richard contributed to the testing of the products. Alec Webster built on the experience, working as a machinist. He brought these skills to UC Santa Cruz, where he contributed to the construction of particle accelerator and astronomical devices. Alec worked for 14 years at the UC Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics. During that time, he became increasingly intrigued by the environment&#8212;by soil, and plants, and how they all work together&#8212;and he enrolled at UC Santa Cruz as a re-entry student. In 2002, he earned his degree in environmental studies.<br/><br/>Alec Webster now serves on the UC Santa Cruz Foundation board of trustees.<br/><br/>Webster Laboratories grew steadily over 20 years. Will was known for becoming personally invested in the success of his employees, providing mentorship and fostering team spirit.<br/><br/>In 1990, working with Dr. Sonny Jackman, Will designed and began producing a device to diagnose and cure a debilitating congenital heart arrhythmia called Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome. The Coronary Sinus Blood Flow Catheter became its first proprietary product. The business began multiplying, and in 1996 it became a part of Johnson &amp; Johnson. It continues to operate as Biosense Webster and has thousands of employees worldwide.<br/>
<h3>&#8220;It&#8217;s never about you&#8230;&#8221;</h3>
The Helen and Will Webster Foundation has established five presidential chairs at UC Santa Cruz, spearheaded the renovation of the Hay Barn, and endowed Rachel Carson College. The foundation has also made grants to the University of Oklahoma, where Will collaborated with Dr. Jackman; to a chemistry building at Caltech; and to the trauma wing at Huntington Hospital in Pasadena. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about people and helping provide resources that people can use,&#8221; Alec Webster said. &#8220;He believed everybody should have an opportunity to live a good life.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s never about you&#8212;it&#8217;s always about what you do for others!&#8221; Will wrote in <em>The Road to Scientific Success.</em><br/><br/>The Websters&#8217; first son, William, died in 2000. Helen Webster died in 2017. The Websters are survived by their sons, Richard and Alec; Alec&#8217;s wife, Claudia; Richard&#8217;s wife, Kimberly Kenne; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="13771f74807270172739340fc044345a"><name>disease-transmission</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study reveals importance of 'cryptic connections' in disease transmission</title><summary>Innovative study of fungal disease in bats quantifies unseen interactions that play a key role in the spread of disease through populations and between species.</summary><keywords>Marm Kilpatrick, white nose syndrome</keywords><start-date>1542643200000</start-date><display-name>Study reveals importance of 'cryptic connections' in disease transmission</display-name><path>/2018/11/disease-transmission</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/disease-transmission</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1542219832130</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1542643580755</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/dusted-tricolor-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/dusted-tricolor-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dusted-tricolor-400.jpg</name><display-name>dusted-tricolor-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>71945</file-size><width>400</width><height>501</height></image><image-alt>tricolor bat glowing with UVF dust</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/little-brown-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/little-brown-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>little-brown-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>little-brown-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20421</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>little brown bat glowing with UVF dust</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Researchers were able to track cryptic connections between bats by coating individual bats, such as this tri-colored bat, with a dust that is fluorescent under ultraviolet light ("UVF dust").

<p>By dusting bats with a fluorescent powder that glows under ultraviolet light, scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, were able to trace the dynamics of disease transmission in bat species that have been devastated by the fungal disease known as white-nose syndrome. Their findings were <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0720-z">published November 19 in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>"These results uncovered connections both within and among species that we never knew about before," said first author Joseph Hoyt, who led the study as a UC Santa Cruz graduate student and is now at Virginia Polytechnic Institute.</p>
<p>"We had been seeing explosive epidemics where an entire population would become infected within a month or two, and it was a mystery how that was happening," he said.</p>
<p>Coauthor A. Marm Kilpatrick, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, said infrequent and indirect connections among individuals play a far larger role in disease transmission than is generally recognized.</p>
<p>"When we think about who we might get sick from, we tend to think of family and friends or coworkers. But there's also that brief interaction with the barista at Starbucks, or the doorknobs you've touched and the shared airspace on the subway," Kilpatrick said. "People are aware of those things, but not how important they are. Their role in epidemics is poorly understood because they are so hard to quantify."</p>
<p><strong>Spillover</strong></p>
<p>Spillover events, when pathogens spread from wild animals to human populations, tend to occur through these kinds of cryptic connections, he noted. "We don't normally appreciate how important they are except retrospectively, when we investigate outbreaks of diseases like Ebola or SARS," he said.</p>
<p>The fluorescent dust used in this study proved to be highly effective at revealing previously unrecognized connections among the bats. The researchers conducted the study at eight hibernation sites (mostly abandoned mine tunnels) in the upper Midwest. Each site had as many as four species of bats using it. At the start of the study, the pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome had not yet reached these populations.</p>
<p>The researchers first surveyed the bats and characterized their social networks, measuring direct physical contacts between bats hibernating together in groups, as well as additional connections made by bats moving between groups. Then they applied the fluorescent dust to selected bats in early winter, using a different color for each individual. In late winter, the researchers returned to see where each color of fluorescent dust ended up.</p>
<p>"The spread of the dust mirrors how the fungal pathogen spreads, and we can see if a bat deposits dust somewhere in the environment and another bat passes through and picks it up. It also reveals infrequent direct contacts that we would not normally observe," Hoyt said.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission dynamics</strong></p>
<p>The fungus that causes white-nose syndrome arrived in the area after the fluorescent dust studies were conducted, and the researchers tracked its spread at each site. They found that the actual transmission dynamics of the disease were better explained by the sum of all the connections revealed in the dust studies than by just using the social networks seen in hibernation groups.</p>
<p>"We were able to explain the actual invasion of the pathogen much better by including those cryptic connections, and they were even more important for explaining transmission between species than for transmission within species," Hoyt said.</p>
<p>One of the puzzling features of white-nose syndrome is its ability to spread through a community of bats during the winter, when the animals are hibernating 99.5 percent of the time. They rouse from hibernation only very briefly every two to three weeks. Yet the dust studies show they move around enough to have many more connections than can be observed in their hibernation groups.</p>
<p>Most striking were the cryptic connections revealed for one species, the northern long-eared bat, which roosts by itself, not in groups. Although classical theory would predict low infection rates for this solitary species, it has been hard hit by white-nose syndrome.</p>
<p>"When we put fluorescent dust on the northern long-eared bat, it would show up on other species that we had never seen them interact with. We would never have predicted that the infection could spread by that route," Hoyt said.</p>
<p>Kilpatrick noted that a different solitary species, the tri-colored bat, has a lower infection rate and showed less evidence of cryptic connections with other bats, although it did transfer dust to surfaces in the sites where it roosts. "It's not that it doesn't rouse and crawl around, it just does so in a home range that has less overlap with other bats, so there may be more territoriality in its use of space," Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for bats, the spores of the fungal pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome persist in the environment and remain infectious for years. Once the walls and ceiling of a cave have been contaminated with the spores, bats using the site for hibernation will be exposed to infections year after year.</p>
<p>"That contrasts with common human diseases like flu and colds. It's true that contact with a doorknob can transmit these viruses, but the viruses don't survive on those surfaces for very long," Kilpatrick said. "One reason white-nose syndrome has been so devastating to bats is that it can survive on surfaces for years, so indirect contacts are really important."</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz researchers are part of a <a href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/">coordinated response</a> to white-nose syndrome involving state and federal agencies, universities, and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>In addition to Hoyt and Kilpatrick, the coauthors of the paper include Kate Langwig at Virginia Tech; Paul White, Heather Kaarakka, and Jennifer Redell at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources; Allen Kurta at Eastern Michigan University; John DePue and William Scullon at the Michigan Department of Natural Resources; Katie Parise and Jeffrey Foster at the University of New Hampshire; and Winifred Frick at Bat Conservation International and UC Santa Cruz.

<p>The award, which is accompanied by a monetary prize, will be presented at the society's March 2019 business meeting in Baltimore.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.srcd.org/membership/caucuses/latino-caucus">Latino Caucus</a> is made up of child development researchers who are dedicated to doing high-quality research with Latinx children, youth, and families.</p>
<p>A social and cultural psychologist, Covarrubias is interested the importance of reflecting the cultural strengths and practices of students from diverse backgrounds in educational settings as a way to foster inclusion and equity. With her team of student researchers in the <a href="https://rcovarrubias.sites.ucsc.edu/">Culture and Achievement Collaborative</a>, she works to translate research findings into practices that can shift the culture of institutions and help students thrive. Covarrubias is the faculty director of the <a href="https://sserc.ucsc.edu/">Student Success Evaluation &amp; Research Center</a>, and she co-leads UCSC's first-generation initiative, which produces programming to support first-generation students and raises awareness about their needs and strengths.</p>
<p>In the award letter, the selection committee highlighted the "conceptual and methodological rigor" of Covarrubias's work, saying it aligns with the caucus's mission of representing the diversity, normative development, and inherent strengths of Latinx youth and families.</p>

The degree of devastation is incomprehensible, with more than 50 people killed, many more feared dead, and more than 8,000 homes and businesses destroyed. We mourn all that has been lost in these cities and towns that so many members of our campus community call home.</p>
<p>We applaud the men and women fighting these fires, and pray they will soon have them under control, though we know it will take years to rebuild what has been lost.</p>
<p>We encourage anyone in our campus community impacted by these fires to reach out for support. This includes those who may not be able to return home for the holidays.</p>

Webster, who founded the Helen and Will Webster Foundation after finding success inventing and manufacturing heart catheters, died peacefully at his home Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.</p>
<p><br/>Will Webster showed us all the power of paying success forward. His engineering brilliance saved the lives of countless cardiac patients. He then chose to spread his good fortune further afield through the good works of the foundation, focusing on educational, social, and environmental causes. That so many of the gifts the foundation has made to this campus have been done in the name of others &#8212; the establishment of five presidential chairs, a central role in the renovation of the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn, the naming and endowment of Rachel Carson College &#8212; speaks volumes to the humble nature and generous spirit of the Webster family.</p>
<p><br/>We have been lucky in that Will and Helen, who passed away last year, and their family, have always had their fingers on the pulse of what makes UC Santa Cruz unique. Their values reflect ours &#8212; a commitment to sustainability and social and environmental justice, a desire to give voice to those whose work is underappreciated &#8212; and their philanthropy has helped nourish our greatest aspirations. That is an incredible legacy, and our campus is forever grateful to both Will and Helen for their transformative generosity.</p>
<p><br/>My condolences to the Webster family: their sons Alec and Richard and their wives Claudia Webster and Kimberly Kenne; and their five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>
<p><br/>Alec is a graduate of Rachel Carson College and current chair of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation board.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC campus community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="18a864f7807270172739340f270e50a9"><name>oakes-honor-blake-feature-podcast</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Podcast: Founding Oakes professor draws a crowd at provost house renaming ceremony</title><summary>Founding Oakes College Provost J.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An enthusiastic crowd of 200 people were on hand to cheer Blake, who heard testimonials from &#160;current Oakes Provost Regina Langhout; UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal; and emeritus biology professor William T. Doyle, a faculty member when the campus opened in 1965. Doyle suggested the name change and is funding all related expenses. </span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake started at UC Santa Cruz in 1966 when he accepted an offer to join as a professor of sociology. Six years later he became Oakes&#8217;s founding provost. Along with a team of forward-thinking colleagues, including Oakes cofounder Rafael Guzman, he helped the college set forth on the path it follows to this day, with a strong emphasis on inclusion and academic excellence. He placed significant value on mentorship and promoting the sciences among underrepresented students. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake remained the provost of Oakes until 1984, when he left to become president of Tougaloo College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the renaming ceremony, one of Blake&#8217;s daughters, Audries Blake, now the assistant director for the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) at UC Santa Cruz, shared fond recollections of the provost house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was within the (provost house) that I as a young woman learned to grow and to dream,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was within the building that lives were transformed. Generational poverty was broken, and people have gone forward in their lives in ways they never imagined because of what took place inside that house. And really, what took place in the house was my father.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://soundcloud.com/ucsantacruz/oakes-renaming-ceremony-podcast-am</url><title>Podcast: J.

<p>That fascination propelled Zihlman's career as a physical anthropologist, during which she plumbed the depths of modern ape anatomy for clues to human evolution.</p>
<p>Now a distinguished professor emerita of anthropology, Zihlman delivered the 29th annual Emeriti Faculty Research Lecture, "The Inside Story of the Apes," to a capacity crowd in the Music Center Recital Hall on November 13.</p>
<p>Zihlman regaled the audience with tales of the meticulous dissection of Bwana, a beloved male silverback gorilla who had delighted visitors to the San Francisco Zoo for decades. She told of her collaborations with renowned chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall. And she wrapped up with an anecdote about the day a crew of 15 animators from Walt Disney Studios immersed themselves in her lab, riveted by the workings of the tendons of a gorilla's hand, as part of their preparation for the film Tarzan.</p>
<p>Driven always by curiosity, Zihlman expressed gratitude for the diversity of opportunities and experiences she's had at UCSC: "You just don't know where basic research is going to take you," she said.</p>
<p>Zihlman's pioneering work on comparative anatomy has yielded paradigm-changing insights about locomotion and the search for the common ape-human ancestor. She joined the Anthropology Department in 1967, becoming one of very few women faculty members at the time. Initially working on fossils and bones, she ultimately became fascinated by what modern ape anatomy might reveal about the past. She turned her attention to the whole body&#8212;the skin, muscles, and bones&#8212;of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees, all of which are threatened or endangered.</p>
<p>Zihlman worked without a proper lab for 27 years. "They built me a large black table, gave me a freezer and some scalpel blades, and I was good to go," she recalled.</p>
<p>In 1994, with the opening of Social Sciences I, the Anthropology Department finally got state-of-the-art labs, complete with a walk-in freezer and a freight elevator. "I had a secret desire to have a large silverback gorilla in my future," Zihlman said of the elevator, which she lobbied for during the building-design process.</p>
<p>Six months later, her dream was fulfilled when she was honored by the opportunity to study the remains of Bwana, the 385-pound gorilla from the SF Zoo. "It was a real team effort," Zihlman recalled, showing slides of her lab crowded with UC Santa Cruz undergraduates, Cabrillo College students, photographers, and her collaborators Robin McFarland and Carol Underwood.</p>
<p>The analysis is painstakingly detailed. "We weigh and measure everything," said Zihlman, who studies body proportions and composition within and across species, as well as differences between the sexes. She compares the mass of the upper and lower body, the forelimbs and hindlimbs. She studies the muscles of the hand, the structures of the foot, joints, and tendons. Nothing goes undocumented.</p>
<p>Zihlman's careful study of two species of chimpanzees, <em>Pan paniscus </em>and <em>Pan troglodytes</em>, yielded revelations about their different body proportions, as well as differences between males and females.</p>
<p>"Everybody loves chimpanzees," said Zihlman, who pointed out the ways in which they have "broadened" ape characteristics: feeding on the ground as well as in trees, traveling further than their ape relatives, being bipedal, and manipulating materials, leading to tool use. Chimps fashion and use spears to stab animals and "wands" to "fish" for termites.</p>
<p>"The females are more adept tool users, and infants learn from watching their mothers," noted Zihlman, who has augmented her lab work with extensive time spent observing animals in the field.</p>
<p>Chimps are also different from humans&#8212;although our shared common ancestor had anatomy something like a chimpanzee, she said.</p>
<p>Zihlman hypothesizes that the success of bipedalism 3 to 4 million years ago sped up evolution among 10 or more species, ultimately leading to <em>Homo sapiens</em>, with less overall muscle, more skin and fat, and flatter feet on which to walk.</p>
<p>Still active in research, Zihlman thanked the students, colleagues, collaborators, vets, and zoo personnel who have been her partners over the years. Mainly, however, she is thankful for "the apes who've helped us understand ourselves."</p>

<p>The 19-year-old UC Santa Cruz film and digital media student wants people to know that there is a vibrant deaf community and culture, and that deaf people love their lives. She spreads the word by making educational videos on her YouTube Channel &#8220;The Essential Sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Maryland native was born severely hard of hearing and slowly lost hearing until in her junior year in high school, she identified as deaf. Though she has always used hearing aids, they don&#8217;t benefit her now and she prefers to communicate with American Sign Language.</p>
<p>Marshall became interested in making videos about deaf culture because as a child, she saw very little representation of deaf people in the media or on YouTube.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many misconceptions and there needs to be more authentic representation and awareness online,&#8221; she said in an email interview.</p>
<p>Her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfEalJW91FE9BDH9xUVDvvg/featured">YouTube channel</a> has attracted 1,217 subscribers with videos on such topics as why she likes sign language, the challenges of lipreading, getting involved with the deaf community and her favorite&#8212;the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDA_EXFTpxo">dos and don&#8217;ts of interacting with the deaf community</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people felt educated by it and I have even been told that some teachers have used it in their ASL classrooms,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;Knowing that my videos are being used to spread awareness is a really special feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>All her videos are captioned with transcripts and some have guest voiceovers so her videos are as accessible to everyone as possible.</p>
<p>She has done a few collaboration videos with deaf activist Rikki Poytner, who has 81,544 subscribers, about bias in the deaf community and &#8220;inspiration porn,&#8221; a term referring to society&#8217;s tendency to over-praise disabled people when they do something ordinary. &#8220;Like if disabled people do something simple, they&#8217;ll be like &#8216;Wow that&#8217;s so amazing&#8217; but it&#8217;s just a disabled person doing something,&#8217;&#8221; Marshall says in the video.</p>
<p>She has also made a few music videos with sign language translation. &#8220;When I pick music covers, it&#8217;s a usually a song that I like that has good lyrical meaning, or the song is trending and I can think of a creative interpretation,&#8221; she said. But she adds that the videos are incredibly difficult to plan and pull off.</p>
<p>Marshall gets many of her ideas for videos from Twitter (@life_laughter_), where she identifies as a queer deaf creator. &#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;ll rant about something and then decide to make a video for it, or if a follower suggests a topic I&#8217;m interested in, I&#8217;ll do it. I try to mostly focus on topics that I&#8217;ve noticed people in my life need to be educated on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her viewers are enjoying her work. She said she is so grateful for the positive comments and encouragement that come her way.</p>
<p>She appreciates it when hearing people reach out and try to understand and learn about deaf people. On her YouTube bio, Marshall praises UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://drc.ucsc.edu/">Disability Resource Center</a> as &#8220;fantastic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The center, based in the Hahn Student Services building, serves about 2,388 disabled students including 35 who use captioning services on videos and two who use ASL translators. The disability resource center also offers note takers and alternative listening devices for those who are hard of hearing. Students can get preferential seating to better see and interpreter and can take time and a half on exams.</p>
<p>Rick Gubash, the center&#8217;s director, said he encourages faculty members to design their classes for the widest audiences possible by, for instance, captioning videos in advance. The center also supports students in &#8220;challenging the deficit perception of disability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marshall plans to pursue a career in film, possibly as a director, cinematographer, or editor. Her dream is to advocate for the deaf in Hollywood. &#8220;</p>
<p>Spreading awareness and educating people about deafness and accessibility is a passion of mine that I have found truly rewarding.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="19e04eb4807270172739340f6a200e61"><name>basic-needs-cafe</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus opens new hub for student food security, support</title><summary>A new basic needs cafe at Cowell College offers free coffee, prepared meals, a juicing station and pastries—all intended to provide low income students with healthy options and alleviate stressors related to feeding themselves.&#13;

(Photo by&#160;<span>Zoe Carrell)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Cowell Coffee Shop for the Peoples&#8212;an innovative nontransactional food store and cafe designed to address food access issues for the student population&#8212;is open for business.</p>
<p>Celebrating its grand opening on November 7, the cafe located at Cowell College will offer free coffee, prepared meals, a juicing station and pastries&#8212;all intended to provide low income students with <a href="https://basicneeds.ucsc.edu/">healthy options and alleviate stressors</a> related to feeding themselves, which can ultimately have detrimental effects on their academic pursuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Food and housing are the biggest costs for students while at UCSC,&#8221; said Tim Galarneau, the Community Engaged Education Coordinator at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. &#8220;We&#8217;ve found that since students were given the option to opt-out of meal plans many of them will skip meals, eat less or run out of food in an attempt to save costs. This ultimately harms their quality of life and prospects for academic success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of the meteoric housing costs in Santa Cruz, students living both off and on campus need about $34,000 per year. Some students attempting to get by with less will make cuts in their food budget.</p>
<p>Brenda Walker, a third-year student at Stevenson College, knows about the struggle with food insecurity and its impact on her studies first hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started out at community college we didn&#8217;t have anything like this and I was on food stamps,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I would get engaged in my studies and I would neglect to concentrate on myself, a good diet, and ultimately my health.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Galarneau this experience typifies that of at least 2,000 UC Santa Cruz students who experience food insecurity.</p>
<p>Galarneau and others participated in the 2016 Global Food Initiative&#8212;a survey of approximately 63,000 students across the UC system, which found that 44 percent of undergraduates and 26 percent of graduate students had experienced food insecurity at some point during their collegiate stint.</p>
<p>Specific to UCSC, the initiative interviewed 605 students and found that 57 percent reporting experiencing low and very low food security, which includes running out of food, skipping meals, and eating less than required due to financial pressures.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we cannot solve structural inequality in the UC alone, we can introduce interventions that support greater student food security and success,&#8221; Galarneau said.</p>
<p>Enter the Cowell Coffee Shop.</p>
<p>The shop, along with giving students access to meals and pastries, also runs workshops about food preparation, knife use, and other skills necessary for students to feed themselves as many of them grapple with the experience of being on their own for the first time.</p>
<p>The cafe is 100 percent student run, with 12 students taking part of the leadership team, while four others develop the programing which includes workshops but also links to financial aid, housing help and statewide programs like CalFresh.</p>
<p>Brenda Walker, a member of the leadership team, said one of the most effective aspects of the coffee shop is how it does not require students to sign up or qualify to use the cafe, saying such requirements often carry a stigma that can chase students away.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is this whole idea of welfare queens, particularly as it applies to people of color,&#8221; Walker said.</p>
<p>For the coffee shop, students simply have to swipe their ID card, which also helps Galarneau and others compile statistics regarding the who uses the cafe, how often and other similar metrics that can help the administration better tailor their services to a dynamic student population.</p>
<p>&#8220;That aggregated data can help us understand who&#8217;s eating at the cafe and understand ways in which the students are using this space,&#8221; Galarneau said.</p>
<p>The cafe is also partnering with the Dean of Students Slug Support food pantry to make sure that students not only have access to meals, coffee, tea and pastries through the cafe, but can find canned goods and fresh organic, student grown produce from the CASFS farm to take back to on- or off-campus housing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a &#8216;take what you need&#8217; policy,&#8221; said Remy Stewart, who works in the pantry on behalf of the university. &#8220;We have so many students coming here, I think there is no longer any illusions about how severe a problem it is.&#8221;</p>

An LRDP is a land use map that designates campus land according to various uses, such as academic and housing.&#160;<em>It is not an enrollment plan nor is it a master plan.</em></p>
<h3>What&#8217;s in an LRDP?</h3>
<p>To undertake this work on designating land use, we are using a test enrollment figure to understand the square footage needed on the campus by 2040&#8212;the 20 year horizon for which the LRDP will cover. The test enrollment figure of 28,000 students is reflective of what the campus founders envisioned for the eventual campus size (27,500 students by the year 1990). It also aligns with historical enrollment growth.</p>
<p>To reiterate, this enrollment number is not a mandate for enrollment, but rather a number to help identify impacts of land use at this enrollment capacity. The test enrollment figure is evaluated at three significant points in the LRDP planning process. The first evaluation takes place when a draft land use scenario is selected. The second point of evaluation occurs when the draft LRDP is developed and the environmental analysis begins. The final evaluation occurs when the draft Environmental Impact Report is complete and the LRDP is being finalized to submitted to the Board of Regents for review and approval. We anticipate the plan will be submitted to the Regents in late 2020.</p>
<h3>We want to hear from you!</h3>
<p>We share with you today three land-use test scenarios that have been mapped. These maps have been developed based on feedback from the online mapping tool, campus and community forums, and discussions with expert working groups and the LRDP Planning Committee. The three test scenarios show academic and student housing land use designations. Also included are possible future employee housing scenarios, which will eventually be incorporated into the land use scenarios.&#160;</p>
<p>We are seeking your feedback on these test scenarios as part of the process of further refining these initial ideas that have been developed thanks to your input. We ask that you submit your thoughts using an&#160;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfMGIvEhxxYrIeR8c_ICo5buYHBDrj129szUbrQ_Vd3feSNg/viewform">online Google form</a>.</p>
<p>The form will be open until Dec. 5, 2018.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekS-N9khQn9fthkKk5VKcj3aj3VYLt97/view">briefing document</a> is&#160;available online.&#160;</p>
<p>This document outlines the various assumptions underlying the approach to the land use test scenarios for academic space and student housing, as well as potential approaches for locating employee housing.</p>
<h3>How will we use your feedback?</h3>
<p>Your feedback will be we shared with the LRDP Planning Committee, as they work to identify two land use test scenarios. The LRDP Planning Committee is not limited to any one of the three scenarios, but may integrate elements from different scenarios to develop the best land use plan.&#160;</p>
<p>In January, the committee will host campus forums to workshop the refined scenarios. We will, again, host community forums to update the broader community on the status of the current planning process and the land use scenarios.&#160;</p>
<p>By the end of the academic year, we will identify a preferred land use scenario to analyze. The testing and analysis that we do at that time will be informed by the ideas and concerns expressed by campus constituents and the community at large. Analysis will be undertaken on a variety of topics, including traffic, water, and housing.</p>
<p>Your feedback is important. To ensure that we can be as inclusive as possible, we have extended the LRDP development timeline. We truly hope that you will take the time to offer us your feedback on the campus&#8217;s land use plan out to 2040.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Kim Lau and Sarah Latham, LRDP Planning Committee Chairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1d5c582e807270172739340f737d07a9"><name>pa-11-15-airquality</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Air Quality Status</title><summary>Smoke from local fires and the Camp Fire in Northern California has been impacting our local air quality over the past week.

<p dir="ltr"><span>If you choose to use respiratory protection, please note that only NIOSH approved face masks labeled &#8220;N95&#8221; or &#8220;P100&#8221; are designed to filter smoke particulates.

Contact Environmental Health &amp; Safety for assistance in respirator selection (459-2553, <a href="mailto:ehs@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ehs@ucsc.edu</a>). Students may purchase N95 masks at the Student Health Center pharmacy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition to the above, Physical Plant Services is assessing the operational impacts associated with adjusting air handling systems within buildings that have this capability and notes that outside air flows through standard air filters which help to remove particulates. Where feasible, Physical Plant Services personnel may reduce the number of outside air changes per hour within buildings to help with this issue. These steps will only be taken for those locations where a reduction in air flow will not create other issues concerning air quality and thermal comfort within a building (i.e., CO2 levels or indoor temperatures rising to unsafe levels).</span></p>

Our work with the lab will be done in close collaboration with our Academic Senate.</p>
<p>The Internationalization Laboratory aims to help U.S. colleges and universities craft comprehensive internationalization strategies, with the ultimate goal of infusing global perspectives in all teaching, research, and scholarship. The lab also aims to widen institutional partnerships and relations on the international stage.</p>
<p>Technological advances have shrunk the world. Communities across the globe are becoming increasingly connected &#8212; via social media, commerce, and, of course, higher education. UC Santa Cruz has more students studying abroad right now than at any other time in its history, and a growing population of international students. We have seen a burgeoning number of global research partnerships and faculty collaborations. Developing and supporting our international programs and partnerships, with the insights and guidance of our faculty, will serve us well.</p>
<p>The idea of widening our international footprint is not new. Our faculty and students have been reaching across the globe for years, and we have worked to support them by creating a Division of Global Engagement. Our strategic academic planning will work synergistically with the ACE program. Our work in the cohort can support experiential learning, our commitment to diversity, the components of our<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sap.ucsc.edu/design-principles/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542496352900000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvMEQg1A5n7M8_EPhAPy38GaC2xQ" href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/design-principles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Design Principles</a><span>&#160;</span>that focus on our world-transforming work, as well as our<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542496352900000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFt4ad5tbT5U2s7x1GbtRnyVuPUFQ" href="https://sap.ucsc.edu/apa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Academic Priority Areas</a><span>&#160;</span>that look to global futures and the well-being of people and places across the globe.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz joins 10 other U.S. universities in the cohort. This effort&#8212;assessing and analyzing our current international activities, determining where we can most effectively focus our energies, then creating a plan that will lead us there&#8212;will unfold over the next 18 months. At that point, a final report will be delivered to campus leaders, who will determine how our campus can best proceed.</p>
<p>Our participation with ACE is occurring in close collaboration with the Academic Senate, and will be led by a steering committee of about 15 members: Senate representatives, faculty at large, and faculty administrators. Our work will touch all departments and divisions, faculty and staff.</p>

Law 2014 Ecuadorian Amazon</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Exhibition runs through December 1 at Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery</article-subhead><article-text><p><em>Forest Law 2014</em>, a 38-minute multi-channel video installation and photo text assemblage based on research carried out by Ursula Biemann and Paulo Tavares in the Ecuadorian Amazon, is currently on display at the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery through December 1.</p>
<p>The exhibition--a collaboration between UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences, the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery, and the Center for Creative Ecologies--examines the legal cases that plead for the rights of nature against the dramatic expansion of large-scale extraction activities in the region, including a trial won by the indigenous people of Sarayuku, Ecuador, based on their understanding of the living forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming to UC Santa Cruz from showings in major international biennials in Sao Paolo and Sharjah, <em>Forest Law</em> is timely and powerful,&#8221; noted John Weber, director of the Institute of Arts and Sciences. &#8220;The piece is being shown worldwide and is currently on view in Sweden, too. It was also in Mexico City, Beijing, Jakarta, and at the Broad Museum at Michigan State, which commissioned the piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>"We are particularly happy at how many faculty are bringing students to the show and incorporating it into their teaching,&#8221;&#160;Weber added. &#8220;This is another example of how the Institute of the Arts and Sciences is providing our students with exposure to artworks of international caliber that examine the issues of our time. In this case, <em>Forest Law </em>is reflecting the campus&#8217;s academic priorities in its search for climate justice.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Biemann is an artist, researcher and video essayist based in Zurich, Switzerland. <span style="caret-color: #222222; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;"></span>Tavares is an architect based in Quito, Equador, whose work deals with the visual and spatial politics of territorial conflicts and climate change.</p>
<p>Together, they researched a series of landmark legal trials in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in which claims were made for the rights of nature in the face of human destruction occurring on the sovereign land of indigenous nations in the Amazon. <em>Forest Law</em> examines the sum of the legal, ecological, cosmological and scientific dimensions in these conflicts about climate change.</p>
<p>Ecuadorian Amazon is one of the most bio-diverse regions on Earth and provides essential functions in global climate regulation. It is the home of indigenous nations and a land of great ethno-cultural diversity. Containing vast deposits of oil, gas, and minerals, it has also become the target of many corporate extractive industries, intent on capturing the mineral wealth, despite the disastrous effects these industries have on the area and its people.</p>
<p>In 2008, indigenous lawyers and experts successfully fought to amend the constitution of the State of Ecuador, establishing fundamental rights of nature for eco-systems to fight this extraction.</p>
<p>"To experience this exhibition at the Sesnon Art Gallery, situated on the edge of a logged redwood forest, gives us pause to consider the rights of any forest,&#8221; observed Shelby Graham, director of the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate student in IAS curator Rachel Nelson&#8217;s history of art class (<em>Contemporary Art in a Global Field</em>) wrote, &#8220;This was an insightful exhibition about the Ecuadorian Amazon...I went into the exhibition knowing next to nothing about the Amazon Rainforest and left with a sense of wanting to get involved and find a way to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another student noted, &#8220;I found the exhibition especially powerful for how the installation incorporated the audience into the artwork--I felt like I was in the Amazon, or at least in a world in which I could feel the reverberations of ecological degradations as heavily as those who inhabit the Amazon do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Santa Cruz continues to experience poor air quality as a result of smoke from the <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2277">Camp Fire</a> in Butte County. The <a href="https://airnow.gov">EPA Air Quality Index</a> (AQI) indicates that Santa Cruz is currently in the &#8220;Unhealthy&#8221; range, with a corresponding health message stating &#8220;People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion. Everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion.&#8221; As of Saturday afternoon, the chart on the right shows air quality levels over the past 72 hours.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Campus residents with respiratory illness or other medical conditions that may be exacerbated by smoke exposure may pick up N95 masks from the three dining halls open over the weekend: Cowell, Colleges 9/10, and Rachel Carson.</p>
<p>Although the student health center is not open on the weekend, students who may be experiencing respiratory distress should consult with other medical care providers. If you are experiencing significant imminent health issues, please dial 911. Detailed information on weekend and after-hours health care for students can be found on the <a href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/forms/student-handbook/HC-816-After-Hours-Care-Info-Sheet.pdf">Student Health Center website</a>.</p>
<p>Environmental Health and Safety will continue to monitor local air quality and update the UC Santa Cruz community as substantive developments occur. Remember to help protect air quality inside our buildings by keeping windows and doors closed.</p>
<p>Employees who work outside on the weekend can contact EH&amp;S at ehs@ucsc.edu for questions or assistance with respiratory protection.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>You can donate by barrel, online or donation envelopes found at campus mailstops.</p>
<p><strong>Your donations are secure through campus mail services. &#160;Donation envelopes are being distributed this week. Please make checks payable to Second Harvest Food Bank and mark your affiliation on the memo line.</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about the drive and how to make donations at our website:<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.edu&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1542823968913000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGjJqIHuDldVWf8cUFm5FXGmWgkXw" href="http://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.<wbr/>edu</a>&#160;</p>
<p>Last year<span>&#160;</span><u>the UCSC holiday food drive raised over 100,000 meals</u><span>&#160;</span>for our friends and neighbors in need, making<span>&#160;</span><i>UCSC the third largest contributor in the county.</i>&#160;</p>
<p>We are honored to work in cooperation with Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz, the healthiest food bank in the nation. With their buying power, Second Harvest distributes over 60% of their meals in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables. Second Harvest recognizes the importance of eating smart and it&#8217;s long-term connection to the health of our community. Your pantry donations go a long way, but your envelope donations can go further with a lower carbon footprint. One hundred-percent of your donation is used to feed people in need in our local community, and just one dollar feeds a family of four.</p>
<p>Please make a donation to support this great cause either in one of our campus pantry barrels or by using the donation envelopes distributed through campus mail.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support. If you would like to get involved with the food drive, please contact:</p>

The changes are incongruous with our values as an academic community.</p>
<p>These changes prioritize demands made by the representatives of alleged assailants at the cost of victims courageous enough to come forward, and aim to reduce the liability of institutions, overlooking that our primary responsibility is to ensure a safe learning environment for all of our students and employees. They clearly diminish the necessary protection of critical civil rights designed to increase representation and participation in education.</p>
<p>I want our campus community to know that UC Santa Cruz remains deeply committed to protecting students and employees from sexual violence and sexual harassment through a timely, transparent and trauma-informed process that is fair to both complainants and respondents. Sexual violence and sexual harassment violate the fundamental values of our campus, and we will continue to work unceasingly to create a campus where everyone feels welcome, safe, and treated equitably.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="378f6abb807270172739340f858f16d4"><name>town-hall-chancellor-search</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dec. 3 town hall focused on chancellor search</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Chancellor’s Search Advisory Committee invites and encourages faculty, staff, and students to attend town hall sessions at the Stevenson College Event Center on Monday, Dec. 3.</summary><start-date>1542787200000</start-date><display-name>Chancellor search</display-name><path>/2018/11/town-hall-chancellor-search</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/town-hall-chancellor-search</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1542825404060</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1545420123875</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em><strong>The link for the recorded live stream of the town hall sessions is&#160;<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/rE3kWUTc7Lm">now available.</a></strong></em></p>

<li>The session for faculty is at 10 a.m.</li>
<li>The session for staff is at noon</li>
<li>The session for undergraduate and graduate students is at 2 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p>The event is an opportunity for you to offer your feedback on the selection of a new chancellor to members of the search committee.</p>
<p>These sessions will focus on the important opportunities and challenges that will face the new chancellor. Please review the questions below to help us think about the future of UC Santa Cruz and the ways in which we can tangibly measure the success of the new chancellor:</p>
<ul>
<li>In hiring this person, what will be the fundamental differences in UC Santa Cruz one year from now, three years from now, and five years from now?</li>
<li>Are there subjective or informal measures for determining the success of this individual?</li>
<li>What organizational activities need to be sustained? Which ones enhanced? Which ones initiated?</li>
</ul>
<p>After hearing from you and other campus stakeholders, the search advisory committee will synthesize what it has learned into a position profile. It will provide a compelling description of UC Santa Cruz, its history, mission, and competitive environment, as well as a realistic and enticing picture of the challenges, measures of success, and ideal qualifications for the new chancellor. Once completed, the document will be posted on the <a href="https://chancellorsearch.ucsc.edu">chancellor search website</a> and shared broadly with prospective candidates and key sources.</p>
<p>If you are unable to join the meeting in person, the session will be <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/rE3kWUTc7Lm">live-streamed</a>.&#160;I encourage you to share your thoughts via the online chat box and also via an <a href="https://www.research.net/r/UCSCChancellor">online survey</a>. Comments submitted via the survey will be shared with the committee. The form allows for anonymous submissions.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend the meeting or to view the live-stream, please visit the <a href="https://chancellorsearch.ucsc.edu">chancellor search website</a>. There, you can provide feedback to the committee at any time or even nominate candidates for chancellor.</p>
<p>Thank you for your participation in this important effort.

It turns out ecological changes in the African savanna, not the emergence of our hominin ancestors, led to the extinction of African ‘megaherbivores’ millions of years ago.</article-subhead><article-text><p>Five million years ago, the Ethiopian savanna boasted some three types of giraffe, two rhinos, one hippo, and four elephant-like species. But today&#8217;s East African ecosystem appears very different than its ancient counterpart, with communities having fewer very large mammals.</p>
<p>Some scientists have argued that our hominin ancestors&#8212;like <em>Homo erectus</em> and their australopithecine relatives&#8212;played a role in driving large mammal extinctions in Africa several million years ago. But that explanation for what happened to most of Africa&#8217;s &#8216;megaherbivores&#8217; (a designation for species that weight more than 2,000 pounds) has remained largely untested, until now.</p>
<p>New research shows that there was indeed a steady decline of megaherbivore diversity&#8212;all told, 28 major lineages went extinct&#8212;that started around 4.6 million years ago. But according to a team including <a href="https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/&#126;pkoch/">Paul Koch</a>, distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences and dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, the demise of these large mammals was mainly due to grassland expansion on the continent that was likely tied to falling atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;The extinction of these megaherbivores took place over the course of nearly 4.5 million years, and pre-dated major events in pre-human cultural development like butchering animal carcasses with stone tools by some one million years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Koch joined a team led by <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u6013388-Tyler_Faith/research/index.hml">Tyler Faith</a>, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Utah and curator of archaeology at the Natural History Museum of Utah, to &#8220;rigorously test the idea&#8221; that our human ancestors affected significant changes in the surrounding ecosystem. Faith said such speculation is not unreasonable as, &#8220;We know that our species is more than capable of driving extinctions today, so why not extend the history of our impacts on the natural world deep into our evolutionary past?&#8221; But in this case, the data didn&#8217;t support that theory.</p>
<p>In this new study&#8212;<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/938">published November 23 in the journal <em>Science</em></a>&#8212;Koch, Faith, and their colleagues John Rowan from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Andrew Du from the University of Chicago, compiled a seven-million-year record of megaherbivore extinctions from more than 100 fossil sites in eastern Africa. The team noted that, not only did the extinctions begin long before the emergence of any hominin species that might even be remotely capable of hunting, but the rate of megaherbivore diversity decline didn&#8217;t change following the appearance of Homo erectus, one of the human ancestors previously associated with the extinctions. Instead, study of stable carbon isotope records of vegetation from east Africa and global atmospheric carbon dioxide records revealed a link between extinction and the spread of grassland and falling atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last five million years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tropical grasses do better under low carbon dioxide levels; their type of photosynthesis gives them a competitive edge against other plants,&#8221; Koch said. &#8220;So the grasses expanded, and the trees receded.&#8221; And since the isotopic data indicated that many of the extinct megaherbivores ate woody vegetation, the group proposed that these animals disappeared along with their food.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Koch has used isotope chemistry data to track changes in species and their habitats over time. In 2012, he worked with Ph.D. student Brooke Crowley and others to study how ecology shaped the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/lemurs.html">extinction of giant lemurs</a> after humans arrived on Madagascar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Human impacts are extremely important in explaining what&#8217;s happened to the world over the 100,000 years,&#8221; Koch said. &#8220;You can see the human thumbprint everywhere, but it&#8217;s important to explore whether other explanations are equally viable.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Koch, the value of this study isn&#8217;t necessarily about debunking old theories about anthropogenic impacts. For him, it&#8217;s an elegant example of how environmental changes drive floral changes, which then drive faunal changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The modern faunas of Africa are iconic examples of how communities with large mammals work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now we see how grassland expansion shaped those communities&#8212;in the very same ecosystem that drove our own evolution as a species.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="516ce496807270172739340fd1bba7b8"><name>alumni-chancellor-search</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni listening session on Dec. 4</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Chancellor’s Search Advisory Committee invites and encourages alumni to join a listening session from 4–5 p.m. on Dec. 4 via video conference.</summary><start-date>1543219200000</start-date><display-name>Listening session</display-name><path>/2018/11/alumni-chancellor-search</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/alumni-chancellor-search</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1543259349126</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1543259349126</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UC Santa Cruz Chancellor&#8217;s Search Advisory Committee invites and encourages alumni to join a listening session from 4&#8211;5 p.m. on Dec. 4 via video conference.</p>

The governance committee then puts names forward to the board of trustees, which further whittles down the list to 16 candidates, who are voted on by the full membership. The eight candidates receiving the most votes are elected to the board.</p>
<p>Massoud, who was born in Sudan and raised in California, studies law in conflict settings, with a focus on Islamic law and society. He teaches courses in international law, human rights, and comparative law. In 2016, he received a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/04/massoud-carnegie.html">Carnegie Fellowship</a> to explore the interplay of human rights and religion in Islamic states after war. He is also a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/massoud-guggenheim.html">Guggenheim Fellow</a>.</p>
<p>In their election announcement to members, LSA President Kim Lane Scheppele and Executive Officer Steve Boutcher noted the diversity of the newly elected leaders, as well as the diversity of their scholarly interests: "We are thrilled that LSA has such a distinguished new set of leaders, and we are really proud of our members for electing such a wonderful and historic group."</p>
<p>Massoud is the second board member from UC Santa Cruz, following Sociology Professor Hiroshi Fukurai, who was elected in 2010 and served until 2013.&#160;</p>

Thompson has been donated to Special Collections &amp; Archives at UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>The founder of &#8220;Gonzo&#8221; journalism, an intensely personal style of writing that often includes the reporter as part of the story, Thompson is perhaps best known for his 1971 book, <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em>, as well as his cultural and political contributions to <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine, which turned him into a counterculture icon. <br/><br/>The campus received the gift from Eric C. Shoaf, who is the author of <a href="https://www.williammckeen.com/book-3/"><em><strong>Gonzology</strong></em></a>, an extensive bibliography of Thompson&#8217;s work. Shoaf has spent more than 30 years acquiring the materials in the collection, which after processing will be made available to scholars and researchers through the University Library. <br/><br/>&#8220;<em>The Eric C. Shoaf Collection of Hunter S. Thompson</em> documents decades of work by this Gonzo journalist and author who peeled back the layers of post-counterculture America through his writings and artistic collaborations,&#8221; noted Teresa Mora, Head of Special Collections &amp; Archives at UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>Mora said that in addition to first editions, translations, and pirated copies of Thompson's books, the collection also includes rare printed materials, ranging from early broadside poster publications and collective artists' magazines to fine press editions, and even a beer bottle containing a never before published short story printed on the label. <br/><br/>&#8220;This collection reveals the scope of Thompson's long engagement with many forms of print and art throughout his life, and opens a door for students and researchers interested in considering Thompson's place in 20th-century writing and literary presentation,&#8221; she added. <br/><br/>Shoaf explained why he decided to donate the collection to UC Santa Cruz, despite the fact that he had no previous connection to the campus. <br/><br/>&#8220;I found UCSC to be an institution young enough to accept the collection and to appreciate it for what it represents and how it dovetails and augments the Grateful Dead archive,&#8221; said Shoaf. &#8220;Of course Thompson knew the Dead, spent time living in San Francisco and Big Sur during the sixties, and also hung out with the Hell&#8217;s Angels motorcycle club that became friendly with the Dead. To me the synergies of placing this Thompson collection alongside the Grateful Dead archive, and its appeal to researchers for both subjects, made this an easy decision to place the collection at UCSC.&#8221;<br/><br/>Born and raised in North Carolina, Shoaf received a B.A. degree from Duke University, and holds Masters degrees from both the University of Rhode Island and North Carolina Central University. A lifelong educator, he has worked in libraries and information services at a variety of academic institutions including the University of Texas at San Antonio, Brown University, Duke University, Clemson University, and he currently serves as Dean of the Library at Queens University of Charlotte.<br/><br/>Shoaf said he first discovered Hunter Thompson right after college. After reading the book <em>Hell&#8217;s Angels</em>, he &#8220;jumped right in&#8221; and began to read everything he could find by the author.<br/><br/>&#8220;I never met Mr. Thompson in person, but I did get an introduction from his literary editor, the educator Doug Brinkley,&#8221; Shoaf noted. &#8220;This led to a number of late-night telephone calls that I had with Thompson, each of which was long and quite illuminating. The protocol was for me to call at midnight MST, then start talking when the answering machine picked up and keep talking until someone picked up. It worked every time...He did especially enjoy talking about the old publications and was surprised with a few I had uncovered that had had forgotten about.&#8221; <br/> <br/>&#8220;I had plans to visit him at his home outside Aspen, CO in spring of 2005 but he passed away in February of that year,&#8221; Shoaf added. &#8220;The next summer, his widow Anita Thompson invited me out to spend a week at the house and look through Thompson&#8217;s personal library among other things. That was a very nice thing to have happen.&#8221;<br/><br/>In addition to bibliographic work on Hunter Thompson, Shoaf has published three books on William S. Burroughs. He is also widely published in popular music and guitar-related magazines. His next publication will be a bibliography on the works of Tom Wolfe.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5626c505807270172739340f7f86496d"><name>campuspoweroutage</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Power Outage Impacts Data Center Services</title><summary>Power in the Data Center is currently shut down due to an early morning campus power outage.

Schlegel, a retired professor and Episcopal priest who was active in community peace and justice programs, died November 8th, 2018 at his Santa Cruz home. He was 85 years old.</p>
<p>A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and a Korean War Navy veteran, Prof. Schlegel retired in 1987 from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he had been a fellow of Merrill College and professor of anthropology and southeast Asian studies for some twenty years. He was the author of numerous books and scholarly articles in several languages, mostly concerning the Teduray rainforest people of the southern Philippines. In 1973&#8211;4, under the auspices of the Ford Foundation, Schlegel established the Social Science Research Training Center in Aceh, Sumatra, where field research methodology is taught to Indonesian provincial university social scientists. From 1976 through 1980, he was the founding chairman of the Joint Committee on Southeast Asia of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies. In 2002, he was honored by the Philippine Anthropological Association for his lifetime of Philippine research.</p>
<p>Schlegel worked with the Philippine Episcopal Church in the late &#8217;50s and early &#8217;60s. During that period, he founded St. Francis High School in Upi, Cotabato, the first academic high school in the area, and served as Archdeacon of Cotabato. He retired in 1992 from St. Luke&#8217;s Episcopal Church in Los Gatos, where he had been rector since 1984. In 2000, he was life professed as a member of the Third Order, Society of St. Francis. A long-time activist and advocate of ending the death penalty, in the early 2000s he worked in the effort to unionize the strawberry workers in Santa Cruz County.</p>
<p>Schlegel is survived by his daughter-in-law, Andrea Ramos, his son-in-law, Gilbert Ramos, his grandchildren, Vanessa Ackermann and her husband Eric, and William Schlegel Jr. and his wife Jena. His son Leonard died in 1993 and his son William in 1999. His wife, Audrey Stier Schlegel, died in 2011.</p>
<p>A memorial service will be held at St. John&#8217;s Church, Aptos, at 10:30am on Saturday, December 8th, 2018. Stu requests that in place of flowers or donations his friends go out for a good dinner and celebrate all the joy in their lives and in his.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56eb4dfc807270172739340f91a43d37"><name>naspa-aaron-jones</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Retention specialist recognized by student affairs association</title><summary>Aaron Jones, a retention specialist for African, black, and Caribbean students, was recently recognized by the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators for his service in its African American Knowledge Community. </summary><start-date>1543305600000</start-date><display-name>Staff recognition</display-name><path>/2018/11/naspa-aaron-jones</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/naspa-aaron-jones</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1543351519634</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1543358081978</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/aaron-jones-2018-2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/aaron-jones-2018-2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>aaron-jones-2018-2.jpg</name><display-name>aaron-jones-2018-2.jpg</display-name><file-size>61835</file-size><width>250</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt>Aaron Jones</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Aaron Jones joined UC Santa Cruz in 2016 to support the holistic success of ABC students.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Aaron Jones, a retention specialist for African, black, and Caribbean students, was recently recognized by the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators for his service in its African American Knowledge Community.</p>
<p>Jones received NASPA&#8217;s Region VI Award for Knowledge Community Achievement for Collaboration and Visibility after serving for four years as a subregional and regional representative.</p>
<p>The student affairs association has 34 knowledge communities which provide access to information and resources in a particular subject area.</p>
<p>&#8220;Led by KC Representative Aaron Jones, the (African American Knowledge Community) has made great strides to increase their visibility, share knowledge, and engage student affairs professionals throughout the region,&#8221; wrote Region VI Knowledge Community Coordinator Molly Bechtel in a nomination letter.</p>
<p>She went on to note that the community developed a collaborative infrastructure and built a team of engaged student affairs professionals to support social media and events.</p>
<p>Jones joined UC Santa Cruz in 2016 to support the holistic success ofAfrican, black, and Caribbean (ABC) students through academic advising, counseling, and other assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaron has been a staunch advocate for the advancement of African/Afro-Latinx/Black/Caribbean students at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Shont&#233; Thomas, director of the African American Resource &amp; Cultural Center. &#8220;In Aaron&#8217;s time at UCSC, he has aided in the implementation of Black Academy, an orientation program to support ABC first-year students, and he has facilitated professional development workshops regarding advising tools for ABC students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaron has been a great champion of equity and student success for students with minoritized identities and we are fortunate to have him as part of this team.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56f4ddc8807270172739340fd5016b1d"><name>aaas-zehr</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ocean scientist Jonathan Zehr elected 2018 AAAS Fellow</title><summary>Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded the distinction of AAAS Fellow by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).</summary><start-date>1543305600000</start-date><display-name>AAAS Fellow</display-name><path>/2018/11/aaas-zehr</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/aaas-zehr</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1543352146335</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1547146728651</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/zehr-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/zehr-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zehr-400px.jpg</name><display-name>zehr-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>132251</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Jonathan Zehr</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/zehr-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/zehr-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>zehr-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>zehr-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15217</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jonathan Zehr</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jonathan Zehr</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded the distinction of AAAS Fellow by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Election as AAAS Fellow is an honor bestowed upon AAAS members by their peers.</p>
<p>Zehr was recognized for &#8220;distinguished contributions to our understanding of biogeochemistry and marine symbiosis, particularly those involving nitrogen fixation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zehr&#8217;s research focuses on microorganisms that &#8220;fertilize&#8221; the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use (a process called nitrogen fixation). His discoveries in this area have implications for understanding the ecology of the open ocean, the cycling of nutrients, and how the oceans might respond to global warming.</p>
<p>The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has supported Zehr&#8217;s research with nearly $8 million in grants from 2004 to 2012. The foundation also provided $4.8 million in funding for the marine microbiology research facility (MEGAMER) that Zehr oversees. His research is currently funded by the National Science Foundation and the Simons Foundation.</p>
<p>The tradition of AAAS Fellows began in 1874. This year 416 members have been awarded this honor by AAAS because of their scientifically or socially distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications. New fellows will be honored during the 2019 AAAS Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, in February.</p>
<p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the world&#8217;s largest general scientific society and the publisher of <em>Science</em> and related journals. AAAS was founded in 1848 and includes nearly 250 affiliated societies and academies of science.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="57503fa4807270172739340f6986fbd9"><name>silver-slug-scholarship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Staff member receives inaugural Silver Slug award</title><summary>A new scholarship from the UC Santa Cruz Retirees Association aims to make a university degree more affordable for UC Santa Cruz staff and their dependents.</summary><start-date>1543305600000</start-date><display-name>Silver Slug award</display-name><path>/2018/11/silver-slug-scholarship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/silver-slug-scholarship</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1543358135172</created-on><last-modified-by>jhillard</last-modified-by><last-modified>1543424364625</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>J.D.

<p>The UC Santa Cruz Retirees Association Silver Slug Scholarship will enable its first recipient to graduate early. Tony Soto used the scholarship to pay for summer classes, moving the completion of his degree earlier by two quarters.</p>
<p>A community safety officer, Soto (Merrill &#8216;19, legal studies) can typically be found patrolling campus in the evenings, which he prefers because it gives him the daytime to pursue his studies. He said it was an honor to be the first awardee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really ecstatic and very grateful,&#8221; Soto said.</p>
<p>Soto has been in his job for five years. He says the position is mostly routine, though he does assist responders during emergencies. And it can include surprises. Earlier this summer he found a group of students involved in a wiccan ceremony in the woods near Porter College. He had to ask them to stop because of the fire safety issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t happy, but you can&#8217;t have a bunch of candles out in the woods at this time of year for safety reasons,&#8221; Soto said.</p>
<p>As a community safety officer, Soto has enjoyed getting to know students from the time they arrive on campus to their graduation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice watching these young adults grow,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Soto is excited to spread the word about the scholarship and tuition discounts available to UC Santa Cruz employees. He said he didn&#8217;t think educational benefits are well-known among staff.</p>
<p>Members of the Retirees Association were inspired to establish the scholarship by memories of working alongside fellow employees struggling to cover educational costs for themselves or their dependents.</p>
<p>Mary Wells, who was on the Retirees Association board that selected Soto, noted that he has worked full time throughout his adult life and that on top of his studies and his work, he dedicates time to raising his children.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were impressed with his persistence,&#8221; Wells said. &#8220;Tony is truly a person who will have earned his degree when he graduates, and we thought typified the kind of UCSC employee for which this new scholarship award is intended.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 41-year-old called his path to a B.A. a &#8220;long winding road.&#8221; Prior to attending UC Santa Cruz, he had earned associates degrees in psychology, social sciences, and administration of justice. His next step will be law school or another area of graduate studies.</p>

<div>Recommendations if going to the beach:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Never turn your back to the ocean. Always keep your eyes on the ocean.</li>
<li>Stay away from and out of the water during swell events.</li>
<li>Stay further back from the water's edge and off rocks and jetties.</li>
<li>If an area is wet, assume that another wave will reach that location again.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to rescue pets that have been swept into the sea, most pets will make it out of the water on their own.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Growing up in Michigan, Courtney Bonam moved from the predominantly black community of Oak Park to the predominantly white town of Ann Arbor. Her new middle school, which had the largest racial minority enrollment in the city, was dubbed the "ghetto school."</p>
<p>Twenty-five years later, that language has stayed with Bonam, an assistant professor of psychology who studies racial stereotypes about physical space, including houses and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>"Calling it the 'ghetto school' was coded language&#8212;racialized language&#8212;for the 'black school,'" said Bonam, a social psychologist who joined the faculty this fall. "Each time someone called my school 'ghetto,' they were implicitly reaffirming a mental link between black and undesirable."</p>
<p>Through a series of experiments and surveys, Bonam has explored the assumptions people make about neighborhoods and schools that are either predominantly black or white, and she has uncovered racial bias in the way people perceive communities. An early experiment revealed that people attribute negative characteristics to black neighborhoods, including "crime-ridden," "rundown," and "impoverished." By contrast, white neighborhoods were described as "safe," "well-maintained," and "wealthy." More recent work yielded similar splits whether people were asked to describe black and white areas that are middle-class or lower-class.</p>
<p>"I don't think these findings are surprising at all, but it's really important to identify them and write about these patterns," said Bonam. "People don't usually think of physical spaces as potential targets of racial stereotyping, but they are."</p>
<p>Bonam's findings broaden our understanding of the psychological processes of stereotyping, and the insidious ways racism operates in society: They reveal racially biased thought patterns that likely help determine property values and the desirability of entire neighborhoods, and that shape land use decisions, such as where schools, parks, industrial facilities, transportation corridors, and other infrastructure are placed. Ultimately, the health, safety, and wellbeing of residents of predominantly minority neighborhoods may be at stake.</p>

<figcaption>"What we're identifying is an example of racism that most people don't think of as racism," said Courtney Bonam, an assistant professor of psychology. "These findings don't necessarily involve racial animus, or negative feelings toward black people. It's a more insidious thought process that doesn't necessarily involve thoughts about people at all." (Photo by C. Lagattuta)</figcaption>

<p><strong>A different form of racism</strong></p>
<p>Another of Bonam's experiments asked respondents to consider a proposal to build a potentially hazardous chemical manufacturing facility near a residential area. Half the participants were told the neighborhood was mostly black; the others were told the plant was proposed for a majority white area. When respondents thought the neighborhood was black, they were less likely to oppose building the chemical plant.</p>
<p>Bonam doesn't necessarily attribute these outcomes to overt racism directed toward black people. Rather, she explains that people can have racial biases about space that are independent of how they feel and think about people.</p>
<p>For example, although most of Bonam&#8217;s studies have been conducted with national samples, space stereotyping was also evident in a study she conducted with white and Asian residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is known for being diverse, liberal, and espousing racially egalitarian values. "They were still stereotyping," she said.</p>
<p>"What we're identifying is an example of racism that most people don't think of as racism," she explained. "These findings don't necessarily involve racial animus, or negative feelings toward black people. It's a more insidious thought process that doesn't necessarily involve thoughts about people at all."</p>
<p>Bonam calls this process an "unchecked form of racial bias." Many people are motivated to control their biases&#8212;to try to be racially egalitarian toward <em>people</em>. Bonam&#8217;s findings indicate that people are less likely to control their biases toward physical spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Next up: urban planners and schools</strong></p>
<p>In her next project, Bonam has begun interviewing urban planners in an effort to learn more about how to mitigate the impact of these thought processes on land-use decisions that reinforce racial disparities in access to healthy neighborhoods and amenities like parks and grocery stores.</p>
<p>Bonam is also interested in the presence of schools, especially elementary schools. "Research shows that children throughout the country are more exposed to environmental pollution, especially air pollution, than we might think should be the case given that they&#8217;re a vulnerable population," she said. "Children in schools in minority neighborhoods are overexposed relative to children in white schools." Racial stereotypes toward black neighborhoods could be contributing to this overexposure, which she noted can negatively impact academic achievement.</p>
<p>Although most of Bonam's work to date has focused on black and white neighborhoods, she sees evidence of racial stereotyping of Latino, Arab American, American Indian, and Asian American areas. She plans to explore the consequences of space stereotyping for these groups as well.</p>
<p><strong>Civil rights violations</strong></p>
<p>Bonam's findings have been featured in two amicus briefs filed by the Equal Justice Society in race-discrimination cases regarding housing and environmental decision making in Texas and New Jersey. Her research may help shift the legal standard for a civil rights violation from "discriminatory intent" to "disparate impact."</p>
<p>"It's harder to prove intent&#8212;that people <em>intended </em>to discriminate&#8212;which is the more commonly accepted standard," she explained. "Disparate impact just means that policies have disparate impacts on different populations. When using this standard, courts are saying that, even if unintentional, policies shouldn't disadvantage one group and privilege another."</p>
<p>"My work is being used to argue for the disparate impact standard, because it shows you don't really need to be intentional in your biased behavior to still be engaging in racial discrimination," she added.</p>
<p><strong>Education is the path to change</strong></p>
<p>Bonam hopes that greater awareness of racial bias and stereotyping toward spaces will lead to change and greater equity.</p>
<p>But she also acknowledges that breaking down these stereotypes may be challenging, in part because some patterns of racial disparity seem consistent with stereotypes she has identified. For example, compared to white Americans, black Americans are more likely to live in high-poverty neighborhoods. That pattern is consistent with the "black areas are poor" stereotype. But she points out that <em>most </em>black Americans do <em>not </em>live in high-poverty neighborhoods.</p>
<p>"Poverty is not an essential quality of black neighborhoods," she said. "It's the cumulative effects of decades of federal and local policies that cut off black people&#8217;s access to resources, like home mortgages and well-resourced schools, that has led to the overrepresentation of black people among high-poverty neighborhoods."</p>
<p>A recent, brief intervention study by Bonam and her colleagues underscores how learning this critical history could help facilitate social change.</p>
<p>In the experiment, some white participants listened to a short clip from the National Public Radio program "Fresh Air," during which historian Richard Rothstein discussed his research on the role of racially discriminatory housing policy in the creation of black U.S. ghettos. Most participants reported learning something new, which in turn made them more likely to acknowledge that systemic racism is a problem today. This shift is important because defining racism as systemic, rather than episodic, predicts greater anti-racist social action.</p>
<p>Bonam plans to test the idea that learning the full history of U.S. housing policy will help counteract racial stereotypes about neighborhoods and the places people learn, work, and play.</p>
<p>"Education is one of the best chances we have for changing the way people think about race relations and racial inequality," she said. "It's really our best shot."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/11/images/courtney-bonam-to.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/11/images/courtney-bonam-to.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>courtney-bonam-to.jpg</name><display-name>courtney-bonam-to.jpg</display-name><file-size>17610</file-size><width>344</width><height>140</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Courtney Bonam</thumb-alt><title>Racial bias taints neighborhoods—and residents, research reveals</title><description>Breaking down sterotypes.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of my work is people management. I don't have any true direct reports, but sometimes I feel like I have 100! It helps that I truly enjoy the population I serve. While on SAB, I hope to help move our campus forward regarding some of the resources and support that other UC campuses and similarly sized public institutions benefit from. After work, I love walking the beach and taking in breathtaking views during Golden Hour... I'll let you know when it gets old.&#160;</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am a Banana Slug and a College 8 alumna. &#160;I have had an amazing opportunity to serve, work with, and learn from our brilliant UCSC students as the Director of the African American Resource &amp; Cultural Center since 2013. I am fully committed to educational equity and access with an emphasis on students with minoritized identities. This work is fatiguing, never-ending, exciting, fulfilling, and a key to liberation. &#160;The joy from my role as a scholar- practitioner is most evident when I am able to experience and directly support the transformation resulting from a student's capacity to be resilient and persist towards their goals. My hobbies include dancing, riding roller coasters, and writing chapters for my dissertation [*cough cough*]! I am excited to serve in my first year with Staff Advisory Board to address a variety of concerns/challenges UCSC staff are experiencing as well as engage in critical conversations to build and sustain positive and productive morale. Let's go, team!</p>

images of a Type Ia supernova, from the moment of explosion through the rise and fall of the light curve, show an unexpected early rise in brightness</article-subhead><article-text><p>An exploding star in another galaxy has been documented with unprecedented precision thanks to the Kepler Space Telescope&#8217;s <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/supernova/">K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment</a>, one of the telescope&#8217;s final missions before running out of fuel late last month.</p>
<p>Kepler&#8217;s observations of the supernova known as SN 2018oh showed an unexpected fast rise in brightness that may be an important clue to understanding the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, which cosmologists use to study the expansion of the universe and dark energy.</p>
<p>An international team led by astronomers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, conducted an analysis of SN 2018oh focusing on the first week after the explosion. Their paper, accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10061">available online</a>, is one of a series of papers analyzing SN 2018oh.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incredibly exciting discovery,&#8221; said Georgios Dimitriadis, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz who led the analysis. &#8220;When I downloaded the data and started looking at it in detail, my jaw dropped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The observations are exquisite, because we have images from Kepler every 30 minutes, starting from before the explosion all the way past its peak brightness. And it&#8217;s scientifically interesting because the increase in brightness deviates from the expected behavior,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=foley">Ryan Foley</a>, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The supernova was also extensively monitored by ground-based facilities which provided important complementary observations, including the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, and the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.</p>
<p>The light curve of the supernova shows how its brightness changed over time. A typical supernova gets steadily brighter for almost three weeks, then gradually fades away. SN 2018oh, however, brightened very quickly right after explosion before settling into the normal progression. Because of the fast brightening, SN 2018oh was about 3 times brighter than a typical supernova a few days after explosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;This early bump in the light curve requires an extra source of light, and the question is where does that come from,&#8221; Foley said.</p>
<p>Dimitriadis said the team investigated three possible explanations.</p>
<p>"We know a Type Ia supernova results from the explosion of a white dwarf that acquires extra mass given to it from a companion star,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t know what kind of star donates this extra mass.&#8221;</p>
<p>One possibility is that the white dwarf accretes matter from a star like our sun. This scenario could give rise to extra light (the bump in the light curve) when the shock wave from the exploding white dwarf runs into the companion star. As the supernova flows around the companion star, it creates an area of extremely hot material on the star which emits light in addition to the light from the supernova.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that scenario, we would expect the observation of excess light to be very dependent on the viewing angle, which may explain why it has not been seen in all supernova observations,&#8221; Foley said.</p>
<p>Another prediction of this scenario is that the excess light would be blue, because of the high shock temperatures. The researchers obtained critical color information for SN 2018oh from ground-based observations. "We observed blue colors at the time of the flux excess, a key clue in understanding what was causing the extra light,&#8221; Dimitriadis said.</p>
<p>The scenario where the supernova runs into its nearby companion star should produce blue light similar to what was seen from the ground. However, the researchers did not rule out other possible explanations. The light from a supernova comes from the radioactive decay of heavy elements such as nickel&#8211;56, which tend to be in the center of the star. If nickel accumulates on the surface during the explosion, however, its radioactive decay could also generate excess light at an early stage of the supernova. It could even produce a &#8220;double detonation&#8221; in which a small explosion on the surface triggers a second explosions that consumes the entire star.</p>
<p>Another possibility is excess light being emitted when the shock wave from the supernova heats a large shell of material just above the surface of the star. According to Foley, the color information from early ground-based images is critical to distinguishing between these different scenarios.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blue color, in particular, agrees with the scenario in which the supernova interacts with a companion star, and is harder to explain with either nickel on the surface or the heating of circumstellar material,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is significant because it favors one of the two general models for Type Ia supernovae that astrophysicists have been debating for decades. In the &#8220;single-degenerate&#8221; model, the white dwarf accretes matter from a normal companion star until it reaches a certain limit and explodes. In the &#8220;double-degenerate&#8221; model, the excess mass results from the merger of two white dwarfs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interaction with a companion star is a prediction of the single-degenerate model, whereas the other two scenarios for the excess light could fit with either model,&#8221; Foley said. "This supernova is consistent with the single-degenerate model, but there are other supernovae where there is strong evidence against a normal companion star, so it remains an open question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dimitriadis adds that his team continues to observe the supernova, searching for additional clues about how it exploded. He says, &#8220;This is an important problem, and we will keep chipping away at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>SN 2018oh is located in a spiral galaxy called UGC 4780 in the constellation Cancer at a distance of more than 170 million light years. This galaxy was included as a target for monitoring by NASA&#8217;s Kepler Space Telescope as part of the K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment. The supernova was discovered in February 2018 by the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). Early images were obtained by the Pan-STARRS1 telescope and the CTIO Mayall telescope with DECam.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study was a large collaborative effort involving 150 scientists from a wide range of specialties,&#8221; Dimitriadis said. &#8220;A lot of credit goes to the people who worked on the Kepler telescope and gave it extra life with the K2 mission. Kepler was not designed to observe supernovae, and we had important contributions from exoplanet scientists because they know the instrument best.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coauthors of the paper include scientists from more than 50 institutions, including UC Santa Cruz, Space Science Telescope Institute, and UC Berkeley. This work was supported in part by NASA, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Packard Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and the Heising-Simons Foundation.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old San Fernando Valley resident said the experience was &#8220;fantastic but simultaneously terrifying.&#8221; She barely knew the other students she was traveling with before she left but found the challenges of navigating an unfamiliar foreign town brought them together. Her highlights were watching a dramatic thunderstorm and bonding with new friends at the goodbye dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a unique experience that I cannot replicate anywhere else or in any other time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is expanding its faculty-led summer abroad programs this year from just two programs last year to <a href="https://studyabroad.ucsc.edu/programs/ucscfaculty-led/index.html">seven this summer</a>. Registration has opened for faculty who want to <a href="https://studyabroad.ucsc.edu/faculty/facultyproposal.html">propose a course for summer 2020</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the university&#8217;s global engagement department has developed four new direct bilateral student exchanges that provide new study abroad opportunities for students during the academic year. Registration is open now for all these new programs.</p>
<p>In the past, students seeking a study abroad program were mainly directed to the UC Education Abroad Program, which coordinates and manages foreign exchanges, including enrolling students at all 10 campuses.</p>
<p>Until two years ago, there was no support for UC Santa Cruz faculty to propose and lead a course abroad for their students. Also because Santa Cruz did not have any direct exchanges with partners abroad, it was difficult for faculty and students to develop relationships with foreign universities, said Alice Michel, director of UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://studyabroad.ucsc.edu/index.html">Study Abroad</a>. Partnerships with universities abroad are key to internationalizing a campus and providing opportunities not only for undergraduates but graduates and faculty to work and research abroad.</p>
<p>This year, Santa Cruz developed direct institutional exchanges with four universities around the world: University of Sussex in England, Danish Technical University and Aarhus University in Denmark and Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain. Students receive credit towards their UC degree when they take approved courses at the host university and students from the host university in turn receive credit when they enroll at UC Santa Cruz. One Santa Cruz student is now enrolled at University of Sussex and three students from Danish Technical University are now taking classes at Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Michel hopes the new faculty-led and exchange programs will increase student participation in studying abroad. Currently, UC Santa Cruz sends about 600 of its 18,000-some undergraduate students abroad each year.</p>
<p>Casey Rubenfeld, a 22-year-old Santa Cruz student, loved her experience studying woodblock printmaking (moku hanga) in Tokyo last summer. She had lived in Japan for six months but had wished she had spent more time doing art and was glad to get a second chance to visit the country. She said the program was well worth it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would highly recommend it to other art majors interested in Japanese culture/art,&#8221; Rubenfeld said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to say what the best part was, but it was fantastic going to all the various museums around Tokyo, making our own paper in Ogawa machi, learning the techniques of Moku Hanga with Tokyo Geidai master students, and having enough free time to do our own excursions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubenfeld also enjoyed the time getting closer to Santa Cruz art professor Jimin Lee, who led the program.</p>
<p>Lee had such a great time that she is leading the program again this summer. She was heartened to see how much the students appreciated the experience. For them it was a lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>A world traveler herself, Lee believes it&#8217;s very important for young people to travel to different countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an artist, I did so many residency programs in other countries like India and China,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It made a huge impact on my art work because it was a real-time experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said there&#8217;s a huge difference between getting up close and looking at a work of art as opposed to looking at a reproduction in a book. &#8220;I believe you have to go there and get really close and step on that soil and think about it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Art professor Dee Hibbert-Jones is excited to lead her first study abroad program on &#8220;Art in a Global Context&#8221; in the Czech Republic this summer.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is exciting because it has gone through a lot in its transformation from communism to capitalism, Hibbert-Jones said. &#8220;It has a major underground art scene that has been going on before and after the revolution,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nowhere else in the world that has that opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students in the program will visit museums and cultural sites and create their own art work at the ArtMill&#8217;s Center for Sustainability in the Bohemian countryside.</p>
<p>The other <a href="https://studyabroad.ucsc.edu/programs/ucscfaculty-led/index.html">five study abroad programs</a> this summer that are coordinated through UC Santa Cruz involve accelerated Italian on the Amalfi Coast in Italy, agroecology in Cuba, international film in Bologna, Italy, serigraphy (silkscreen printing) in Spain and an overview of space missions in China.</p>
<p>Becky George, assistant vice provost for Global Engagement, said the university will continue to develop new partnerships with universities abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need these partnerships to grow multi-dimensional international collaboration and touch all aspects of research&#8212;undergraduate and graduate,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="7ac10b5580727017273daba4e3392d83"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1541059200000</start-date><path>/2018/11/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2018/11/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1513887959878</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1513887974913</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
