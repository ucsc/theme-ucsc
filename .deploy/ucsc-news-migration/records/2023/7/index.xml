</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 1, UCSC alumna Madison Nguyen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Rachel Carson &#8217;97, history)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed papers to run for the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors District 2. The primary election is March 5, 2024. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top two candidates will go into the general election on November 5, 2024. The winner will start their term in January 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been about nine years since 48-year-old </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen, a former (and first Vietnamese American) San Jose Vice Mayor and Council Member, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">left politics. When she stepped away from elected life, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remained actively engaged in the community by running a non-profit, working with the San Jose Chamber of Commerce, and continuing to support causes and candidates who shared her values. More recently, she served as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Vice President (EVP) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at The Silicon Valley Organization and as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVP at AsianNet Media.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t envision running for office again, until the last year or so, when something changed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I started to hear from more and more friends, residents and colleagues who were frustrated with the direction we are heading.&#8221; This included homelessness and the lack of affordable housing. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing rising crime, which impacts residents and businesses alike.&#160; Voters have consistently supported initiatives up and down the ballot to confront these challenges. We are a compassionate and thoughtful community. We want to support vulnerable residents, small businesses, children and families and our seniors. But the harm to our community is no longer tolerable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question she kept hearing from people in the community was, why can&#8217;t our elected leaders just get things done? &#8220;That&#8217;s a very good question. It&#8217;s true these are big challenges. These are hard problems, but they are not unsolvable. I know they aren&#8217;t because I worked and helped solve these very same problems when I was on the City Council.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she was elected as a San Jose City Councilmember in 2005, Nguyen saw that District 7 lacked major community benefits present in other parts of the city which included affordable housing, road safety, retail opportunities and parks.. She worked with two mayors and fellow councilmembers to address these issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I stood up, fought back, and added protections to preserve more than 10,000 mobile homes for seniors and low-income families.&#8221; She also worked with affordable housing developers and helped build more than 1,000 affordable housing units for local low-income families and seniors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that many children in the district were at risk of going down the wrong path, Nguyen worked with the Franklin McKinley School District and other community partners to launch the Children&#8217;s Initiative in 2010. &#8220;In this cradle to college program, we worked with parents and school-aged children to create a safe and fun environment where kids could learn and thrive academically and socially. This initiative coordinated existing educational, health, social service, housing, neighborhood, and economic development efforts to provide a comprehensive community development approach to cutting poverty for families in the Santee and Fair neighborhoods.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen served on the San Jose City Council from 2005-2014 and served as San Jose Vice Mayor from 2011-2014. When she left office, Nguyen felt things were headed in the right direction. &#8220;Today, I don&#8217;t feel that way. And I&#8217;m sorry to say but our county leadership isn&#8217;t getting us there, at least not at the pace that residents expect and deserve. I am running because I have the experience, the knowledge, and the drive to get things done and because I am results-driven. And it&#8217;s time for results.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Nguyen&#8217;s top priorities are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the homelessness crisis (including providing mental health support services, addiction treatment, more interim housing, and job placement opportunities), affordable housing (for seniors and low-income families) and safety (including working with law enforcement on response time and allocating more resources for crime prevention).</span></p>
<h3><strong>Childhood and Early Education</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her determination has its roots in her childhood. She is a living example of what a person can accomplish with hard work and a strong education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was born in the central part of Vietnam, in a city called Nha Trang. Her family escaped Vietnam in the middle of the night in a small fishing boat when she was four years old. They were rescued at sea and brought to a refugee camp in Bataan, Philippines. The family stayed there for almost three years before a church sponsored their move to Scottsdale, Arizona. After a year they moved to Modesto, California. &#8220;My parents began working in the agricultural fields in Patterson almost immediately after our arrival in Modesto. Life was difficult growing up because we were very poor. We lived in a three-bedroom home with 11 people. We relied on government subsidies for almost every part of our lives, from affordable housing to Medi-Cal and free lunches. But I was happy.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up, Nguyen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">appreciated receiving a free, high-quality education. &#8220;My parents instilled in all of us that the primary reason they escaped Vietnam was to provide their children a good education in America. Not only did I receive a great primary and secondary education, I participated in different sports, excelled in academic extracurricular activities and served as Secretary of the Student Council.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has eight siblings; during the summer the kids (starting when they turned 12) worked in the fields picking fruits. &#8220;I worked in the fields every summer until I went to UCSC. I never saw a dollar of my earnings.&#8221; The money she made went towards food and the &#8220;few new outfits&#8221; given to them at the start of the school year. &#8220;My upbringing not only helped shape my desire to pursue a career in public service, but it&#8217;s a constant reminder of where I came from and the obstacles I had to overcome to be where I am today.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Inspiring Experience at UCSC</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen has fond memories of UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I love the campus and the people. I love the academic and social atmosphere. I love the coffee at Stevenson Coffee Shop, the Cowell College Library, and the beautiful ocean view from the West Field. UCSC is one of the best academic institutions in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is grateful for her UCSC education and experience, which has deeply influenced her life. &#8220;It taught me to challenge the status quo, be authentic in everything I do and most importantly, follow my passion, even if it&#8217;s not aligned with my degree. A UCSC education didn&#8217;t just prepare me for a specific career, it prepared me to choose the career that I want.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen has high praise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for her UCSC professors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She speaks of three particular professors as her &#8220;education warriors:&#8221; Alice Yang and Gail Hershatter (from the History Department), and Helen Shapiro (from the Sociology Department).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They were intelligent, thoughtful, caring, understanding, and they exhibited a willingness to see that every student succeeds,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were smart but approachable, tough but compassionate, intelligent but understanding.&#8221; If she were to return to teaching one day, she would strive to exhibit these similar traits.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Graduate School and Early Career</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC, Nguyen worked for a start-up magazine company for a year and then moved to Chicago for graduate school. She received a full scholarship from the University of Chicago, and earned a Master&#8217;s degree.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had such an amazing learning experience at UCSC that I wanted to continue being in love with learning and college life. The studies I did at UCSC propelled me to pursue post-graduate education. I wanted to become a college professor.&#8221; She taught at two community colleges in San Jose and enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen eventually realized her heart was in politics. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I truly love is the opportunity to meet and converse with people from all walks of life. Being a public servant allows me to not only listen to people&#8217;s stories, but it also provides me the opportunity to turn these life stories and experiences into good policies and ordinances that benefit the constituents I serve.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting a Masters, Nguyen returned to UCSC to begin a Ph.D. program in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociology. She was living in San Jose and renting a small room to save money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years later, in 2002, she ran for her first public office. She got involved because she felt that a Vietnamese American voice was needed on the local school board, given that the school district had more Vietnamese students than any other school district in the city. She competed against an incumbent and won. So she left graduate school to pursue a public service career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was unconventional to say the least. This goes to show that you don&#8217;t have to be rich or come from a well-connected family to pursue a career in politics. Oftentimes, it just takes a strong desire to create the change you want to see and be determined to work really hard and show people that you have what it takes to make that change.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Fact: Nguyen didn&#8217;t know that banana slugs existed until she came to UCSC. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most beautiful </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hermaphrodites</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that crawl on this earth and we are proud to have them as our mascot.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="db0f34fc807270460a413fcf72cef26c"><name>justin-cummings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumni Dr. Justin Cummings serves his community county and statewide</title><summary>As the first African American man to be elected to the Santa Cruz City Council in 2018 and Mayor in 2020, the first African American person to serve on the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, and newly appointed member of the California Coastal Commission, Dr. Justin Cummings is making an impact in his community. </summary><start-date>1689750000000</start-date><display-name>justin-cummings</display-name><path>/2023/07/justin-cummings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/justin-cummings</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1687302386916</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1690231635804</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/justincummingsprofilelead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/justincummingsprofilelead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>justincummingsprofilelead.jpg</name><display-name>justincummingsprofilelead.jpg</display-name><file-size>144700</file-size><width>450</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/justincummingsprofilethumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/justincummingsprofilethumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>justincummingsprofilethumb.jpg</name><display-name>justincummingsprofilethumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16541</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Justin Cummings (Ph.D. &#8217;13, environmental and evolutionary biology)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Cummings is the first African American person to serve on the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors and is a newly appointed member of the California Coastal Commission</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From amplifying opportunities for underrepresented students at UC Santa Cruz, to being a former mayor of Santa Cruz, and now serving on the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, Dr. Justin Cummings has made an impact on campus, locally, and statewide. Most recently, Dr. Cummings has been appointed to the California Coastal Commission.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an honor to be considered and selected by Speaker Anthony Rendon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s essential as we&#8217;re thinking about climate change and the impacts it&#8217;s going to have on coastal communities that we are making sure that we are doing our best to help maintain public access and maintain our coasts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Coastal Commission plans and regulates land and water use in the coastal zone in partnership with coastal cities and counties. Cummings says that he hopes to advocate for coastal protections and make decisions backed by science. He says that he will bring his perspective as a Ph.D. graduate in ecology and evolutionary biology from UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Coastal Act is rooted in protecting the environment, restoring the natural environment, and providing everyone with access to the coast,&#8221; Cummings said. &#8220;And my education touches on many of those topics.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings adds that as a renter in Santa Cruz since 2007, he is familiar with the obstacles many face with housing in the county.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important that as we&#8217;re talking about development in coastal communities, that we&#8217;re also ensuring that we are making space for people who are not wealthy, that people of all income levels and all backgrounds get access to the coasts and make sure that we&#8217;re protecting that right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018 Cummings was the first African American elected to the Santa Cruz City Council, and in 2020 was the first African American to be elected mayor in its 154 year history. He was elected Third District Supervisor in November 2022 and is the first African American to serve on the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings said he is proud to be a voice for communities of color and share his lived experience in decision-making.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For 173 years, there has never been an African American on the County Board of Supervisors,&#8221; Cummings said. &#8220;When we think about representation, how our tax dollars are spent, how we&#8217;re creating laws, it&#8217;s imperative that we have people of different diverse backgrounds, so they can ensure that the people who might be most significantly impacted in our decisions have a voice at the table.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended Eastern Illinois University, where he received a bachelor&#8217;s in Spanish and biology. In 2007, Justin moved to Santa Cruz to pursue his Ph.D. at UCSC, and his research focused on invasive species management and tropical forest restoration in Panama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, he became the founding program director for the UCSC Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program, which prepares early-career college students from diverse backgrounds to become leaders in environmental conservation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year the program selects 20 students from around the U.S. and its territories to participate in a two-year conservation leadership program. Scholars enjoy two fully-funded summers in an immersive mentorship program focused on conservation research, leadership, communication, and professional skills and join a network of 500+ conservation leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For people who come from lower-income communities that are trying to go into fields like conservation that have historically been predominantly white, it&#8217;s important to make sure that the students have the experience they need when they graduate,&#8221; Cummings said. &#8220;Making sure their resumes are competitive and alleviating financial barriers to participate in these programs each summer is really at the cornerstone and is important in running this program and providing that experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His advice for current students: Reach out to individuals doing the work you want to do.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not a linear path, and there&#8217;s a lot of different directions you can go in, but I think that being open to advice, finding mentors, and surrounding yourself with people who are going to help you reach that goal is most critical.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/justin-cummings-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/justin-cummings-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>justin-cummings-featured.jpg</name><display-name>justin-cummings-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>34915</file-size><width>678</width><height>278</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Justin Cummings</thumb-alt><title>Justin Cummings: Serving our community, protecting our coast</title><description>A former mayor of Santa Cruz and now a Santa Cruz County supervisor, alumnus Justin Cummings has served his community and county—and now, with his appointment to the California Coastal Commission, his impact extends statewide. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e545580b807270460ecc34cdc99dbcb1"><name>delta-salud-dientes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumni on the frontlines of dental care</title><summary>Through a partnership with Delta Dental of California, and two local nonprofits, alumni Anita Aguirre, Kenzie Ferguson, and Kristyn Glenn are changing the landscape of dental care accessibility in Santa Cruz County. </summary><start-date>1688540400000</start-date><display-name>delta-salud-dientes</display-name><path>/2023/07/delta-salud-dientes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/delta-salud-dientes</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1687473706999</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1687473706999</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/dentalalumnistorylead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/dentalalumnistorylead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dentalalumnistorylead.jpg</name><display-name>dentalalumnistorylead.jpg</display-name><file-size>124910</file-size><width>450</width><height>224</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/dentalalumnistorythumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/dentalalumnistorythumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dentalalumnistorythumb.jpg</name><display-name>dentalalumnistorythumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19255</file-size><width>80</width><height>40</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>[From left to right]</strong> Anita Aguirre, Kenzie Ferguson, and Kristyn Glenn. </span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Three UCSC alumni spearhead equitable dental care access to Santa Cruz County seniors
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three UC Santa Cruz alumni are at the forefront of increasing accessibility for senior dental healthcare in Santa Cruz County.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita Aguirre, Kenzie Ferguson, and Kristyn Glenn joined forces through a partnership spearheaded by the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the philanthropic arm of Delta Dental of California</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;and two local nonprofits, Salud Para La Gente and Dientes Community Dental Care:</span></p>
<p><strong>Anita Aguirre (Kresge &#8217;93, sociology and women&#8217;s studies)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Deputy Director and Chief Compliance Officer at </span><a href="https://splg.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salud Para La Gente</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit healthcare organization with 10 clinics and 3 mobile units in Santa Cruz County and North Monterey County.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Kenzie Ferguson (Porter &#8217;93, Russian studies)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Vice President of Foundation and Corporate Social Responsibility at Delta Dental of California.</span></p>
<p><strong>Kristyn Glenn (Stevenson &#8217;13, environmental studies and global economics)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Associate Director of Development and Communications at </span><a href="https://dientes.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dientes Community Dental Care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit healthcare organization with four clinics in Santa Cruz County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They plan to expand dental care access to thousands of seniors in Santa Cruz County.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that three dental professionals are also Banana Slugs was a happy coincidence, but it highlights the impact alumni can have on their community. In 2022, Kenzie Ferguson and a team from the Community Care Foundation set out to introduce new healthcare partners to its Senior Oral Health Coalition Program. Of nine applications across California, Salud and Dientes caught Delta Dental&#8217;s attention.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What truly impressed us was the previous collaboration between Dientes and Salud Para La Gente in addressing oral health challenges, coupled with the formidable capabilities of both organizations and their strategic proximity,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;We reviewed numerous applications from all over California and found that this collaboration harmonized well with our ongoing initiatives, making it a standout choice.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dientes and Salud Para La Gente combined serve 70 percent of low income seniors aged 65 and older that receive dental care in Santa Cruz County.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/oralhealthinamerica"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 National Institutes of Health &#8220;Oral Health in America&#8221; report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cited adults aged 65 and older as the most critically underserved for oral health care in the U.S. The number is even lower in Santa Cruz County, where a 2022 oral health needs assessment revealed that only one in four seniors with Medicaid could get the dental care they needed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2034 there will be more than 77 million people over 65 in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge group of people, Ferguson said. &#8220;With dental not covered in Medicare, a substantial number of retirees find themselves without dental insurance, exacerbating this pressing concern."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delta Dental and the Community Care Foundation recognize the significance of collaborating with Dientes Community Dental Care and Salud Para La Gente, as it will facilitate the development of transformative programs aimed at enhancing health equity and improving the oral health of older adults, particularly those from underserved or vulnerable communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salud Para La Gente is designated as a federally qualified health center (FQHC) and Dientes Community Dental Care is an FQHC subrecipient. This means that the two outpatient clinics qualify for specific federal reimbursement systems and are held to certain standards and regulations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are missioned and mandated to serve the uninsured and low-income, and as a result, we offer sliding fee scales,&#8221; Aguirre said. &#8220;So that is one of the main strategies in providing equitable care; we see people regardless of their ability to pay and whether or not they have insurance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the support of the Community Care Foundation , the two organizations hope they will be able to hire additional providers to serve more patients, increase free care through outreach and education, and bring dental care to seniors&#8217; doorsteps, especially for those that struggle with mobility and transportation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oftentimes, we take our health for granted, especially oral health,&#8221; Glenn said. &#8220;But it is pivotal to overall health and connected to things like heart disease and diabetes. And for seniors, good oral health can mean eating solid foods or talking clearly. Beyond its impact on overall health, it&#8217;s important for individual well-being and is foundational to a thriving community. Everyone deserves the dignity that comes with a healthy smile.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership between the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation, Dientes Community Dental Care, and Salud Para La Gente will run for five years and aims to build a replicable model that can serve other communities and create change elsewhere.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>From UC Santa Cruz to Dental Health Care</strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Anita Aguirre</i></strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">saw a career in public health as a way to actualize her feminist values. Many feminist studies courses she took at UCSC led her to the Santa Cruz Women&#8217;s Health Center, where she completed an internship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was just a pivotal moment in terms of my thinking and being.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterward, Aguirre went to UCLA, where she got a masters in public health grounded in her feminist values. She spent the first 16 years of her career working in sexual and reproductive health, helping women take control of their lives. She said she has a solid connection to her UCSC education and her current work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Kenzie Ferguson</strong></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> attributes her personal growth and development to the supportive faculty and fellow students within the UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) community. During her time at UCSC, she had the remarkable opportunity to immerse herself in Russian studies, studying abroad amidst the backdrop of the Cold War and the subsequent fall of the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My concentration was on language, which allowed me to grasp the essence of individuals through a different lens," Ferguson shared. "One of the invaluable aspects of my education at UC Santa Cruz was the establishment of a strong foundation in respecting, collaborating with, and comprehending different perspectives."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pursued an MBA, lived in the Netherlands for many years, and is now working towards a Ph.D. in international business.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Kristyn Glenn</i></strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">says that the importance of community was ingrained into her early on in her time at UCSC. She was a resident advisor (RA) and lived on campus for three years. She said that experiencing community within the college system helped make a big university feel small, both within her classes and as an RA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I learned at UCSC that a flourishing community takes care of one another,&#8221; she said. &#8220;By the time I graduated, I had fallen so in love with Santa Cruz County that I was determined to put down roots and give back to the community that felt like home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn said that working in the nonprofit sector was the most seamless way to stay connected to her roots and sense of community.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="099ce7058072704638d2873f62de2c63"><name>csaplar-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research: Csilla Csaplar</title><summary>Csilla Csaplar joined UC Santa Cruz on July 6 as the new Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research.

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Schwartz, Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, is retiring on July 1 after 35 years at the university. In her position, she had three primary responsibilities&#8212;teaching, research, and service&#8212;and she devoted herself to all of these.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<h3><strong>Teaching and Research</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing I do in my job is more exciting or rewarding than helping a student discover a new passion,&#8221; says Professor Schwartz. &#8220;This can be getting an undergraduate student in a class for non-majors excited enough about geology that they decide to make it their major, or guiding a nascent graduate student researcher in a direction that helps them uncover something new about how the Earth works. The sense of excitement they feel about discovering something new feeds their curiosity, and their desire to know more fuels new investigations in new directions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Schwartz&#8217;s career, many graduate students accompanied her on field projects, many of whom have continued to pursue fieldwork in their careers. She greatly enjoyed going into the field to conduct research. Much of this involved collecting seismic data in various locations including Antarctica, Alaska, Costa Rica, New Zealand&#8212;and of course, California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz is very proud of the successes and accomplishments of graduate students she advised and worked with over the years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So many have gone on to do creative, important, and interesting work, and I am gratified to know that I may have played some part in starting them off on their paths. I am proud of the rapport that I had and still have with most of these former students and the mutual respect and admiration that exists between us. They have trained and advised another generation of scientists, and I am delighted to follow their accomplishments as well.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classroom teaching was a big part of Schwartz&#8217;s career. She taught several classes for EPS majors and graduate students and educated more than 5,000 students over the last 30 years in a large non-major course called &#8220;Geology of National Parks.&#8221; She frequently runs into students from this class around town. Many tell her how their experience visiting a National Park was enriched through her class.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is exactly the primary learning goal I set for this course,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I can think of nothing more important than helping to impart knowledge that is able to change a student&#8217;s perspective and enrich their life experience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her career at UCSC, Schwartz had a lot of roles in addition to being a professor. She served as the Director of the Keck Seismology Laboratory, the Director of the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth (CSIDE), as a graduate advisor for the EPS department, taught in the COSMOS summer program, and served on many Academic Senate Committees. She also chaired the Committee on Career Advising (CCA) and served as the UCSC representative to the UC systemwide Senate Assembly.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Costa Rica Earthquake Research</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz started investigating earthquake behavior at the northern Costa Rica subduction zone when she first arrived at UCSC. She continued working in Costa Rica on this topic throughout her entire career. With both US and Costa Rican colleagues, Schwartz and a team installed and operated a network of seismic and GPS stations that collected data in Costa Rica for several decades. In 2012, a large earthquake occurred within that network. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having made observations during this earthquake, as well as many years before and after, allowed us to construct models of where strain was accumulating prior to the earthquake and where slip occurred during and immediately after the earthquake,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Our work provided some of the clearest evidence at that time that regions along a fault that are building up strain closely outline the areas that will slip during the next large earthquake. This understanding of strain accumulation and release in coastal regions of subduction zones is of fundamental importance and has improved our ability to forecast the size and location of future subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Loma Prieta Earthquake &amp; Effects on Career</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning a B.S. in geophysics from Brown University and a Ph.D. in seismology from the University of Michigan, Schwartz came to UCSC in 1988 as a UC President&#8217;s postdoctoral fellow. She spent two years as a fellow and then four years as a researcher at the Institute of Tectonics (the predecessor of CSIDE, mentioned earlier) before she joined UCSC&#8217;s faculty in 1994. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred while she was a postdoctoral fellow. This influenced her desire to continue to work at UCSC. &#8220;Following this event, there were a lot of collaborations with colleagues,&#8221; says Schwartz. &#8220;The proximity to so many other institutions engaged in seismology was great. It made sense to do that kind of work in California where a major active fault existed in my backyard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field seismology dominated much of her future research. &#8220;I got to install and operate what at the time was cutting-edge portable digital seismic instrumentation to record the aftershocks of the Loma Prieta earthquake. While traveling around in the epicentral region of the earthquake I saw, close up, the devastating aftermath of a large earthquake and the effects it had on people&#8217;s lives. In the community that I lived in, several people died, and thousands were left homeless and had to live in shelters. This experience remained with me for my entire career and infused my future earthquake research with an important human element.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz encourages everyone to be prepared for an earthquake (including having emergency supplies on hand and ensuring there are no unsecured bookcases or other hazards in their environment).</span></p>
<h3><strong>Gratitude for UCSC</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz loves the physical environment of the UCSC campus. &#8220;Anytime I get frustrated with a particular task or feel badly about something, I take a walk around the campus, smell the redwoods, listen to the birds, and that sense of frustration usually melts away. After a campus walk, I return to my office refreshed and ready to take on the world!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She credits the collegiality of the Earth and Planetary Sciences department for making her time at UCSC especially fantastic. &#8220;When I arrived 35 years ago, I quickly learned the tenor of the department: it was cooperative, accepting, and very welcoming. What a fabulous place for me to land directly out of my Ph.D.,&#8221; she says. &#8220;In 35 years, faculty have come and gone, but the ambiance of the department that the early faculty established has remained. It&#8217;s a great place to work, it&#8217;s highly collaborative, and there is an excellent department rapport. Everyone wants the best for their colleagues and are willing to put skin in the game to help achieve it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schwartz extends words of appreciation to many folks she met along the way:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to thank Marino Protti, my first Ph.D. student, for getting me interested in earthquakes and volcanoes in Costa Rica and for being my colleague in these studies for 35 years,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The UCSC seismology lab has been a great place to work. I have learned so much from my colleagues, Thorne Lay, Emily Brodsky, and Heather Savage, and all the postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, and visiting scientists who have spent time there. So many great discoveries and so much fun!&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Final Thoughts Heading into Retirement</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">64-year-old</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schwartz looks forward to retirement. &#8220;I plan to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel a lot </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my computer,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I like walking and biking trips and already have a biking trip to Portugal with friends planned for this fall.&#8221; She also hopes to do some volunteer work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she retires, Schwartz is comfortable knowing that her EPS department colleagues working on earthquakes will undoubtedly make &#8220;some very exciting discoveries improving our basic understanding of earthquake occurrence and advancing our earthquake forecasting abilities. UCSC has been extremely strong in earthquake research, and even with my and Thorne Lay&#8217;s retirement, it will remain so!&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She notes that the retirement of two earthquake research faculty will, however, make an impact. To assure that the UCSC seismology lab remains an intellectually vibrant and world-class institution, the EPS Department established a &#8220;Seismo Visitor Fund&#8221; to support outside earthquake researchers to visit UCSC to give talks and collaborate with students and researchers. Anyone who wishes to contribute to the Seismo Visitors Fund can do so through <a href="#">connect.ucsc.edu/seismo</a>.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2c89b01280727046750f6700511886e1"><name>right-livelihood-college-global-secretariat</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz’s global impact grows as campus becomes next leader of Right Livelihood College network</title><summary>As the Global Secretariat of the Right Livelihood College, UC Santa Cruz students and faculty to work directly with some of the world’s leading advocates in social justice and sustainability on education, scientific research, and practical activities that spread and upscale their work.</summary><start-date>1688626800000</start-date><path>/2023/07/right-livelihood-college-global-secretariat</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/right-livelihood-college-global-secretariat</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1688669368313</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1688671107465</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/shiva-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/shiva-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shiva-400.jpg</name><display-name>shiva-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>64317</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Vandana Shiva on stage at an event</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/shiva-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/shiva-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>shiva-80.jpg</name><display-name>shiva-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>24415</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Vandana Shiva on stage at an event</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>Anthropology Professor Nancy Chen (left) interviews 1993 Right Livelihood Laureate Vandana Shiva (right), a counter-development activist from India, during a January 2020 public workshop on sustainable&#160;agriculture at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;Photo: Steve Kurtz</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/raqib-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/raqib-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>raqib-400.jpg</name><display-name>raqib-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>84121</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>a group of people of all ages holding flowers in front of a barn</image-alt><image-caption><span>Following a May 2022 student-run guest lecture organized by the Right Livelihood Club, UCSC faculty, students, and staff met with Jamila Raqib (second from left), nonviolent action expert and legacy holder of the 2012 Right Livelihood Laureate for Gene Sharp.

This position will enable UC Santa Cruz students and faculty to work directly with some of the world&#8217;s leading advocates in social justice and sustainability and will draw upon the campus&#8217;s expertise in building productive and equitable community-based research partnerships.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Right Livelihood College is an initiative of the </span><a href="https://rightlivelihood.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Livelihood Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which honors and supports change-makers working for a just, peaceful, and sustainable world for all. The organization&#8217;s annual award has been given to 190 Right Livelihood Laureates from 74 countries since 1980. Each laureate becomes a fellow of the Right Livelihood College&#8212;a network of campuses and centers hosted by nine universities on five continents. The Right Livelihood College engages laureates in education, scientific research, and practical activities to spread and upscale their work. The college is also an affiliate of the UNESCO-based International Association of Universities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has been a member of the Right Livelihood College since 2013 through the </span><a href="https://rightlivelihood.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Livelihood Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is supported by the Division of Social Sciences&#8217; </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Social Transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. UCSC was nominated by the Right Livelihood Foundation to serve as Global Secretariat, a position that rotates periodically among Right Livelihood College members. In this role, UC Santa Cruz will be the network&#8217;s main administrative hub and will take an active role in developing the overall strategy and direction of the initiative.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ole von Uexkull, executive director of the Right Livelihood Foundation, celebrated the campus&#8217;s willingness to lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has always been an engaged and highly collaborative member of the Right Livelihood College,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are excited about the possibilities for how their leadership could continue to advance the network&#8217;s impact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive also praised how the new role reflects campus values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a global research university, our faculty and students are innovators with a deep commitment to social justice,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Becoming Global Secretariat of the Right Livelihood College network fits well with our focus on transformative research and scholarship that serves society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Shaw, the Right Livelihood College coordinator at UC Santa Cruz, will take the lead on the campus&#8217;s new role. He hopes to grow the Right Livelihood College initiative globally through programs that could include a transdisciplinary international research agenda, student exchange programs, new courses at UCSC and partner campuses, additional grant funding for graduate and undergraduate students to work alongside laureates, and more lectures and conferences connecting laureates with students, faculty, and the public.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right Livelihood Laureates want nothing more than to work with all ages, stages, and nationalities to build movements,&#8221; Shaw said. &#8220;And the exciting thing about the Right Livelihood College is that it provides unparalleled access to this amazing global network of change-makers who want to collaborate with us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laureates themselves congratulated UC Santa Cruz on accepting the Global Secretariat role and shared what they value about the Right Livelihood College, as well as their hopes for what the program might accomplish in the future.&#160;</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, UC Santa Cruz has hosted a wide variety of in-person and virtual events with Right Livelihood Laureates. Faculty have joined laureates on discussion panels and connected over shared research interests, while students and community members have learned directly from laureates and joined the conversation. Laureates have also visited classrooms, and several courses have featured their work as part of the curriculum. Research travel grants are available for faculty and graduate students to visit Right Livelihood laureates and colleges, and there&#8217;s a student club that organizes conversations with laureates about pressing local issues.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer believes these types of initiatives through the Right Livelihood Center have made valuable contributions to the UC Santa Cruz academic experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students are the next generation of change-makers, and it&#8217;s extremely important that the education they co-produce is informed by global perspectives,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Right Livelihood Center at UC Santa Cruz is a great example of the creative ways in which we&#8217;re doing that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharan Sethi, a literature and philosophy major, is the student coordinator for UCSC&#8217;s Right Livelihood Center, and she said the Right Livelihood College program has helped her to see herself as part of a global community in ways that she believes will make her activism more impactful. She says the highlight of her involvement with the program thus far has been when she and other UCSC students met with laureate Nnimmo Bassey, an environmental activist from Nigeria whose work focuses on the harms caused by oil production.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8203;&#8203;We were able to directly speak with Nnimmo about his work and his ideas for solutions about these environmental issues,&#8221; Sethi said. &#8220;This was a very fruitful experience, because his talk made me reflect on things I may consider small actions, such as which company I buy gas from, and the larger impact these actions have.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Shaw said he ultimately hopes the Right Livelihood College program will inspire students to have hope and to dream big about the impact that they could make in the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re living in a time when more than 50% of young people think humanity is doomed, and there&#8217;s so much anxiety around big issues like racial and gender injustice and the climate crisis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s important to remember that these struggles are intergenerational, and we are standing on the shoulders of giants. When students work with these laureates and learn how they&#8217;ve been able to create substantive change in their lifetimes, I hope they will see themselves as junior versions of them and know that a better world is not only necessary, but possible.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4537ee5b80727046180d58ad40f58894"><name>avc-staffhr</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Announcing new AVC for Staff Human Resources and Chief Human Resources Officer</title><summary>Kamala Green will be joining Staff Human Resources (SHR) as our next Associate Vice Chancellor for Staff Human Resources and Chief Human Resources Officer effective July 17.  </summary><start-date>1689058800000</start-date><path>/2023/07/avc-staffhr</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/avc-staffhr</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1689083440710</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1689096756970</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/kamala_green.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/kamala_green.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>kamala_green.jpeg</name><display-name>kamala_green.jpeg</display-name><file-size>25504</file-size><width>200</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Campus Community,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am pleased to announce that Kamala Green will be joining Staff Human Resources (SHR) as our next Associate Vice Chancellor for Staff Human Resources and Chief Human Resources Officer effective July 17. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala brings over 25 years of experience in human resources, and diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education and private industry. Before joining a consulting group,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala was the associate vice president for human resources/special assistant to the president for equity &amp; inclusion and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Officer at Mills College. She oversaw support services, including programming, policies and processes; developed a robust new hire orientation and onboarding program, developed and implemented the college&#8217;s antiracism plan; and oversaw compliance efforts with federal education rights and FERPA, among other duties.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Office of Equity and Inclusion executive director and the Title IX coordinator at Arizona State University, Kamala provided oversight of anti-discrimination/anti-sexual harassment/anti-harassment/non-retaliation cases and workplace behavior. She implemented institution-wide diversity initiatives and training for academic and non-academic units. As ASU&#8217;s Title IX and ADA officer, she monitored and oversaw the overall implementation of Title IX compliance at the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Kamala was the senior human resources manager &amp; chief diversity officer, working closely with senior leaders to implement diversity, equity and inclusion-related initiatives, including efforts to recruit and retain staff. She also served as the laboratory&#8217;s Title IX officer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to thank Patricia Hardaway who has served as interim AVC for close to a year. Pat provided strong leadership through a time of change and was a valued member of the Finance, Operations and Administration Services leadership team.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am pleased to announce that Jody Greene, Professor of Literature, and Associate Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning (AVPTL) in Academic Affairs, will join my office as Associate Campus Provost for Academic Success, starting July 1, 2023. This position arises from the acknowledgement that the outcomes we define as student success will be realized in a sustainable way when faculty success, academic student success and institutional success are seen, understood and supported as interrelated and interdependent. Faculty are at the core and forefront of all academic activities that support student academic development - from creating dynamic student research and other experiential learning experiences to designing and implementing effective curriculums with engaging pedagogy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this full-time position, Jody will lead our undergraduate academic student success efforts, as they have done part-time in their work as Special Advisor to the CP/EVC for Academic Success. Jody will continue their ongoing work with academic leadership and faculty on divisional and departmental student success plans, activities, and outcomes. Expanding from the work they did in the role of special advisor and as AVPTL, they will help connect departments with the equity data that underscores and supports student success efforts, as well as supporting efforts to improve curricular coherence, retention, and time to degree for frosh admits and transfers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Associate Campus Provost for Academic Success, Jody will also assist campus efforts to meet the academic goals laid out in the Multi-Year Compact, an agreement established by Gov. Gavin Newsom&#8217;s administration and the University of California, and will participate in UCOP initiatives to better coordinate efforts across the UC campuses in support of academic student success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jody will continue to oversee alignment of faculty welfare and development initiatives with academic student success. To accomplish this goal, they will retain the early-career faculty welfare and development aspects of their current portfolio in Academic Affairs, including new faculty orientation, Teaching Academy, and the Writing Fellows program. The Teaching and Learning Center will co-report to Jody and to Vice Provost of Academic Affairs, Herbie Lee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jody has demonstrated their knowledge, expertise, organizational and institutional acumen at driving forward critically important campus initiatives. Achieving our goal of being a student-centered research university will greatly benefit from Jody&#8217;s leadership in this capacity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please join me in welcoming Jody into this new leadership role.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,</span></p>

The alliance was established in 2022 to work toward two ambitious goals by 2030: doubling the number of Hispanic doctoral students enrolled at our universities, and increasing by 20 percent the Hispanic professoriate in member universities.&#160;<br/><br/>With attendees ranging from graduate students to experienced faculty and campus leaders, the conference established and deepened relationships among the alliance community. Activities centered on sharing strategies for resilience and success in academia, sparking collaborative research among the members, and shaping future alliance programming efforts.<br/><br/>Conference participants attended presentations by keynote speakers and panel discussions featuring leaders in academia, industry, and government, and took part in breakout sessions and networking throughout the week. Attendees across career levels discussed personal and professional experiences on their journey through academia, sharing reflections on obstacles and concrete strategies to overcome them.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I think everybody just needed a space to share their story, and you could see that in the level and participation &#8211; everyone wanted to comment, to share their experiences,&#8221; said Marcella Gomez, UC Santa Cruz associate professor of applied mathematics and associate dean for diversity, equity, and inclusion at the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;Sometimes we just need that, a space for people to be heard and feel that they are being heard by others who can understand where they are coming from.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Keynote speakers included Anne-Marie N&#250;&#241;ez, executive director of the Diana Natalicio Institute at the University of Texas, El Paso; Cecilia Aragon, director of the Human-Centered Data Science Lab at the University of Washington; and UC Regent Jose Hernandez. Panel discussions covered topics such as research leadership, industry collaboration, and federal funding opportunities, and included industry leaders with Genentech and Salesforce, and federal officials from the National Sciences Foundation, the U.S. Air Force, the Department of Energy and the Department of Education.&#160;<br/><br/>For many, the gathering strengthened the sense of community among scholars who belong to universities in the HSRU Alliance.<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m here for all of you,&#8221; Aragon said to the room of attendees at the conference. &#8220;I&#8217;m here if you want to ask questions, to mentor, to connect.&#8221;<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz took a lead role in organizing and hosting the conference, which was made possible by generous support from the Henry Luce Foundation.&#160;<br/><br/>More than 80 people from HSRU institutions participated in the conference, coming from Florida International University, Texas A&amp;M University; University of Texas at Arlington; University of Texas at El Paso; University of Texas at San Antonio; UC Santa Cruz; UC Irvine; UC Riverside; University of Central Florida; University of Colorado, Denver; University of Houston; University of Nevada, Las Vegas; University of North Texas.&#160;<br/><br/>As one of only five institutions in the nation that holds the honor of being a Hispanic Serving Institution, an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution and member of the Association of American Universities, UC Santa Cruz is committed to creating educational equity that will help lead to real, transformative change. The campus in 2022 earned the prestigious <a href="https://www.edexcelencia.org/seal/seal-excelencia-certified-institutions">Seal of Excelencia</a>, recognition for utilizing data, practice, and leadership to intentionally serve Latinx students.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="55ff920a8072704677eda4572a41417c"><name>lamat-institute</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Celebrating the success of a human-centered approach to supporting emerging scientists</title><summary>Graduate school admissions, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship awards, and American Astronomical Society honors mark a banner year for UCSC's Lamat Institute.</summary><start-date>1689922800000</start-date><display-name>lamat-institute</display-name><path>/2023/07/lamat-institute</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/lamat-institute</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1689364959733</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1691516954710</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value><value>Alumni Profile</value><value>Faculty Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Christy Tall</name><title></title><phone/><email>chtall@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/lamat-story-headshot.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/lamat-story-headshot.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>lamat-story-headshot.jpeg</name><display-name>lamat-story-headshot.jpeg</display-name><file-size>123631</file-size><width>450</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/thumbnail-headshotjpg.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/thumbnail-headshotjpg.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>thumbnail-headshotjpg.jpg</name><display-name>thumbnail-headshotjpg.jpg</display-name><file-size>16973</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miguel Montalvo Hernandez (Lamat 2020) was one of the 11 undergraduate students receiving a Chambliss Award at the 241st American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle, January 2023.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a remarkable journey fueled by natural curiosity, keen insight, ambition, and determination, Miguel Montalvo Hernandez, a first-generation college student from El Salvador, set his sights on a future in the sciences. In 2020, as a student at Diablo Community College seeking to gain invaluable undergraduate research experience, he applied&#8212;and was accepted &#8212;to UC Santa Cruz's Lamat Institute. Today, Montalvo Hernandez stands proudly as a UC Berkeley alumnus, having obtained a degree in engineering physics. His journey continues this fall as he embarks on a new chapter at Princeton University, where he will pursue a Ph.D. in astrophysics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reflecting upon his achievements, Montalvo Hernandez attributes the resources and support he received from UCSC&#8217;s Lamat Institute as being pivotal in helping him achieve his goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lamat helps students from nontraditional backgrounds, historically marginalized communities, and community colleges, to get the research experience and resources that we need for getting into a graduate program in astrophysics.&#8221; he said. "This is really important since historically the field has been mainly male and white-dominated&#8212;as reflected by the current demographics of university professors across the country and Nobel Prize winners."</span></p>
<h3><strong>Celebrating Accomplishments</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamat, which means star in the Mayan language, supports community college students and other undergraduate students seeking research opportunities on their path toward graduate school in STEM.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamat provides opportunities for early career scientists to engage in novel research and creates healthy spaces for scientific inquiry for students by focusing on effective mentoring, which can instill a sense of belonging, mitigate the impacts of negative organizational climates, and aid in performance and retention. Lamat&#8217;s comprehensive mentoring training empowers mentors and mentees to co-develop a transformative learning space that prepares and inspires mentees for graduate study.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamat increases participants&#8217; competitiveness for graduate programs and prepares them for the STEM workforce more broadly by providing intensive research instruction through summer internships, a winter computational boot camp, academic counseling and mentoring, astronomy science workshops, and social justice discussions. The support system extends beyond the summer program&#8212;once students are part of it, Lamat continues supporting them through graduate school and beyond.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is celebrating an impressive year.&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montalvo Hernandez is one of seven Lamat alums who will start graduate school in the fall, representing a 100 percent acceptance rate this year by Lamat applicants at a time when getting into graduate school is more competitive than ever. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s astronomy and astrophysics department, for example, received 400 applications in 2023&#8212;double the number received in 2022&#8212;for eight graduate spots.&#160;</span></li>
<li><span>Five Lamat alumni were awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowships (GFRP), which recognize and support outstanding graduate students who demonstrate the potential to be transformative scientists and engineers; three of the five Lamat GRFP awardees are community college transfer students.<strong>&#160;</strong>NSF awarded just 63 fellowships in astronomy.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamat was well-represented at the American Astronomical Society in 2023. Four Lamat students received speaker awards from the AAS this year; Montalvo Hernandez received the prestigious Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Student Award.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can&#8217;t have the best science until all voices are at the table,&#8221; says Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and Lamat founder and executive director.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The interface between scientific excellence and social justice go hand in hand,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There&#8217;s so much talent out there that&#8217;s not being supported in our society. This (the program&#8217;s success) is a clear illustration that when those individuals are supported thoughtfully, their voices are amplified, and they are given a platform to showcase their talents, they achieve things an order of magnitude greater than other students. You know, you are six times more likely to get an NSF grant if you are a Lamat fellow&#8212;that is kind of amazing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramirez-Ruiz applauds this year&#8217;s accomplished Lamat alums for their perseverance during the pandemic. Lamat ran online for two years in an effort to continue to support its students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was afraid that because of COVID I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to do it (Lamat),&#8221; says Montalvo Hernandez who had attended a Lamat bootcamp session in January 2020 in preparation for the summer program. &#8220;But they (Lamat) moved online and it was great.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pivoting to online services during the pandemic is one example of how the Lamat team&#8212;led by managing director Deana Tanguay&#8212;continues to reinvent the program to best support students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Deana&#8217;s vision of leadership and support, all the students you talk to will say how much support they&#8217;re getting from her and the team,&#8221; Ramirez-Ruiz says. &#8220;Lamat is constantly trying to find better ways to support the students regardless of the situation. We&#8217;re not resting on our laurels.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Full circle</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 2009, 129 students have completed the Lamat Institute. Seventeen students are currently participating in the 2023 program. Lamat alums, several of whom are now faculty, give back to the program. Melinda Soares-Furtado (College Nine &#8217;14, physics), now a NASA Hubble Fellow at the Department of Astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, serves on the program&#8217;s advisory board and advises Lamat students on their grad school applications through workshops and one on one coaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soares-Furtado, an early participant in what would become Lamat, says Ramirez-Ruiz was one of the first people who saw potential in her and encouraged her to be aspirational.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He helped me see that I could think bigger, not necessarily from a place of just achievement but from a place of deep personal fulfillment. And that was, you know, really wonderful and impactful. To become very aligned with a vision&#8212;it&#8217;s so powerful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a postdoctoral fellow at the UW-Madison, Soares-Furtado says she now tries to do the same thing with her own students, to help them identify their self-authoring narrative, and how she can support and strengthen it.&#160; Soares-Furtado will join the faculty at UW-Madison in fall 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s really a deep dive,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It might be a slower process than you imagine&#8212;taking the time to understand a person&#8217;s values, dreams, goals, and how that fits into their plans. But it&#8217;s absolutely critical.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rosa Wallace Everson, a graduate student in UCSC&#8217;s Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics Department, finds Lamat&#8217;s community-building aspect incredibly important. She&#8217;s inspired by the program&#8217;s ability to help navigate hidden systems within higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's this additional aspect of community building as well as academic support that is unique to this program. There are a lot of unwritten rules for success inside of academia, that you either learn from the experience of others or you learn through hard knocks and making mistakes. So Lamat tries to create that kind of family environment in a way and teach those sorts of hidden systems and unwritten rules to help empower the students to navigate academia.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everson helps Lamat students develop their culminating scientific presentations, providing multiple workshops to give participants tools for creating and presenting award-winning material.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A human-centered approach</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedro Jesus Qui&#241;onez participated in Lamat in 2021 and 2022 while getting his undergraduate degree at Sonoma State University. He will attend UC Santa Cruz in the fall, pursuing a Ph.D. in astrophysics. He says Lamat&#8217;s holistic approach felt like being part of a family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lamat cares about our success and our well-being,&#8221; Qui&#241;onez says. &#8220;Lamat really helped me in terms of networking&#8212;building relationships, building my professional development, building my research experience&#8212;which ultimately helped me get to grad school. Without Lamat, I really couldn&#8217;t be where I am now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He praises Lamat&#8217;s social justice workshops saying, &#8220;They&#8217;re really unique to thinking about the people aspect of research and how academia as a whole treats different groups of people. We can do better to make academia a more welcoming space so we can do more science.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramirez-Ruiz says that creating a sense of community, a sense of belonging&#8212;truly bringing one&#8217;s whole identity and being valued for who you are&#8212;is at the core of the Lamat program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of intentionality within Lamat is to catalyze talent and then bring it to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly important for us that we are a house. And now, we&#8217;re a nationally recognized home for students of color in the country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everson says that it is one of the parts of Lamat that she admires most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lamat is a force for change in the culture of astronomy and astrophysics. It asks the question, &#8216;What if, instead of climbing over each other to reach our goals, we work together in community, with respect for the land, with respect for others, with tolerance?&#8217; There is space to bring a human-centered approach to not just doing science, but also generating new scientists.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamat is grateful to Julie Packard, the David &amp; Lucile Packard Foundation, the Heising-Simons Foundation, and other generous donors for their support.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association is governed by an elected board of alumni volunteers called the Alumni Council. Twenty-four members make up this year&#8217;s Council, with each councilor serving two-year terms upon being elected. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incoming councilors were selected by fellow alumni during the annual elections held this spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s Alumni Association is excited to welcome five new members: Lakeya Cherry, Julia Dolloff, Patrick Garcia, Abel Mkulama, and Diane Nguyen.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Madrid will continue to serve as the Alumni Council President alongside Meredith Vivian Turner, Past President and Shelly Meron as Executive Vice President. Two new officers were elected to begin their one-year term: Juliet Musso as Vice President of Finance and Jessica Lum as Vice President of Administration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of Madrid&#8217;s leadership as President, three priorities within a strategic work plan were identified. This includes (but is not limited to) solidifying scalable alumni engagement, increasing organizational health, and increasing alumni giving participation. In addition, the Council will continue to aid in, solidify, and grow diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts within the Alumni Council and its work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has been the greatest honor to lead such an exemplary group of councilors over the past year,&#8221; Madrid said. &#8220;I am deeply thankful and amazed by the amount of work they have been able to accomplish this past year and look forward to the impact we will have with our five new exceptional volunteers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Councilors serve as advocates for UCSC and the UC system and primarily focus on engaging and strengthening the university&#8217;s alumni network. They do this by sharing and promoting UCSC&#8217;s vision, leading projects and initiatives to support the Alumni Council Strategic Work Plan, and periodically act in an advisory role when called upon for specific initiatives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Director of Alumni Engagement Shayna Kent supports the work of the volunteers and helps guide their volunteer efforts to current initiatives and needs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Alumni Council is an essential component to strengthen and support UCSC and our network of 140,000 plus alumni,&#8221; Kent said. &#8220;We rely on the experiences, volunteer time and networks to guide our work and support the alumni engagement programs. I am honored to work with such a dedicated group of people who love UCSC.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Welcoming five new councilors&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences, UCSC&#8217;s newest Alumni Council members will hold a vital part in ongoing Council efforts.&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am so thrilled and excited to work with our five new alumni councilors,&#8221; Madrid said. &#8220;I am certain that each will bring a unique and robust set of skills to the team and our work. A special thank you to the Nominations Committee for their work in selecting the five new councilors.&#8221;</span></p>

As such, data science brings together people with different skills and backgrounds, and a new grant for professional development in data science aims to facilitate this by creating communities to study and apply data science in California&#8217;s central coast region.&#160;</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Building Data Science Communities for Improving Student Success&#8221; is a partnership between University of California, Santa Cruz and California State University Monterey Bay. The project will be led by Pedro Morales-Almazan, professor of mathematics at UC Santa Cruz, in collaboration with others.&#160;</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;This grant is a great opportunity for UC Santa Cruz and the local community to learn more about the different aspects of data science,&#8221; Morales-Almazan said.&#160;</p>
<p class="p1">The project will promote the building of data science pathways and offerings to modernize majors, attract historically underrepresented students in STEM, deepen both civic and interdisciplinary learning, and make California the leader in data science education.&#160;</p>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://calearninglab.org/"><span class="s1">California Education Learning Lab</span></a> will empower faculty to expand their knowledge and expertise in data science, fostering innovation and excellence in teaching and research.&#160;</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;One of our main goals is to improve the quality of data science and data science adjacent teaching,&#8221; Morales-Almazan said. &#8220;During these three years, we will facilitate the conversation between data science communities, incorporating the different perspectives coming from faculty and students that are already working with it, plus inviting people that would like to join the conversation.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p class="p1">Professional development activities&#8211;including workshops, seminars, discussion groups, and specialized training programs&#8211;will be organized to provide hands-on experience and equip faculty from different backgrounds with the latest tools, techniques, and methods in data science and data science education. UC Santa Cruz will host a lecture series featuring renowned experts in the field, hold a workshop to aid faculty in incorporating and improving the data science elements in their courses, and facilitate two faculty fellows programs to explore the technical and the multidisciplinary aspects of data science.</p>
<p class="p1">Additionally, the grant will facilitate collaborations between UC Santa Cruz, CSU Monterey Bay, experts in the field of data science, and the local community of community college and highschool professors.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ready for a first-of-its-kind experience at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All UCSC alumni, friends and family are invited back to campus for a three day, two night immersive Banana Slug experience, </span><a href="https://returntotheredwoods.org/schedule.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return to the Redwoods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alumni have the opportunity to relive their UCSC days in an on-campus apartment or residential unit with friends and family, or opt for hotel accommodations around Santa Cruz County. Scheduled celebrations, events, and exploration opportunities will take place all across campus from August 18-20, 2023.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Engagement has partnered with organizations across campus to create curated celebrations for everyone to enjoy. Athletics and Recreations will offer exclusive exploration opportunities including hikes, sailing, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, August 18, join us for a kick-off celebration at the Cowell Courtyard, explore campus and Santa Cruz County, and wind-down with s&#8217;mores under the stars in the East Field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday, August 19, wake up to sunrise yoga on the East Field, have breakfast in the dining halls, take a guided tour through UCSC, or opt-in to a sailing excursion. Wind down with sunset yoga, and a movie feature in the Quarry Amphitheatre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All scheduled events are optional, and more events will be added as Return to the Redwoods approaches.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come back to where it all began. </span><a href="https://returntotheredwoods.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration for Return to the Redwoods is now live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>A reimagined alumni experience&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an Alumni Survey taken in 2021, an overwhelming number of alumni identify with the extraordinary landscape of UC Santa Cruz over any other factor&#8212;a statistic unique to UCSC compared with other universities nationwide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an experience like Return to the Redwoods, alumni have the opportunity to reconnect with a campus unlike any other.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Taylor, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Director of Signature Programs &amp; Local Alumni Outreach, has spearheaded Return to the Redwoods from the beginning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from alumni about what ties them to this campus, and what they want to see in terms of engagement opportunities,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;Return to the Redwoods is a culmination of that feedback and offers an experience unlike any other at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first time UCSC is offering an event of this magnitude,&#8221; Taylor added. &#8220;We&#8217;re hopeful that Return to the Redwoods will become an annual celebration, and something that is ingrained into the Banana Slug Alumni experience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1996, our campus has been recognizing and celebrating instructors for their </span><a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cot-committee-on-teaching/cot-excellence-in-teaching/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellence in Teaching</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160; This recognition at the highest level promotes and illuminates the long tradition of innovative and creative teaching at UC Santa Cruz and its central importance to the university&#8217;s mission. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee on Teaching (COT) is delighted to announce the 8 recipients of this prestigious campus-wide award from all five divisions for the 2022-23 academic year. Annually, the committee receives approximately 450 student nominations and selects 7-10 instructors. The student comments about the impact their excellent pedagogical practices have had on their lives were inspiring. COT appreciates their contribution to the important mission of teaching on our campus and is grateful for the opportunity to showcase their accomplishments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Caitlin Binder, Continuing Lecturer, Chemistry and Biochemistry (recipient in 2015-16)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Caitlin redeemed my love for all chemistry.&#160; They center[ed] their lectures around topics that would relate to their students and their interests to keep us engaged and help us care more about what we&#8217;re learning. I felt that they are one of the few professors I have had who truly care about and understand their students and want to work to help us succeed."</span></p>
<p><strong>Guido Bordignon, Associate Teaching Professor, Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology (also Ron Ruby Recipient)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Guido is an EXCELLENT professor, he infused the class with so much enthusiasm and genuine care that made me really take the class to heart. What I learned in this class changed the way I see the world and deeply impacted the path I am choosing to take when it comes to my education and life.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Knisely, Continuing Lecturer, Writing Program (recipient in 2012-13)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"She cares deeply about her students as individuals and is the most compassionate and understanding teacher I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of interacting with. Her teaching and her lessons go beyond the class and she also offers to help us students out with anything outside of it. I have never met a teacher that has such a big impact on my life as much as Lindsay has."</span></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Quinn, Assistant Professor,&#160; Computer, Science and Engineering&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Andrew Quinn made one of the hardest classes I've taken very enjoyable and beneficial to my future. He&#160; has been one of the most engaging and communicative professors I have been taught by here at UCSC. He approaches situations with an open mindset and empathetic attitude. He has made the content he teaches approachable and understandable."&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Emily Schach, Lecturer, Anthropology</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"She has that rare ability to present dense information not only in an engaging way, but in a way that made it easy to digest and retain. She clearly loves the subject and cares for her students, even in a 90 person class. Dr. Schach always ensures she meets her students where they are at and accommodates them if they are struggling by giving them extra help and allowing them to have extra time to process and work through the material."</span></p>
<p><strong>Saskias Casanova, Assistant Professor,&#160; Psychology&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Professor Casanova supported me in this process and made me feel hopeful in my abilities to be able to conduct research, despite my background. Casanova showed her passion for helping students by providing feedback on assignments, bringing snacks to class, and being flexible to individual student accommodations."</span></p>
<p><strong>Kailani Polzack, Assistant Professor, History of Art and Visual Culture&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Professor Polzak is exceptionally engaged, caring, and deeply knowledgeable, and invested in the whole student. She cares for learning via the class as a whole, rather than simply being invested in imparting her own research on a subject.</span></p>
<p><strong>Aida Mukharesh, Graduate Student Instructor, Sociology</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aida is a very caring and encouraging person. She provided her students an alternative way to think about current world issues, which is very enlightening when I face anything after. Aida fueled my curiosity and interest in the class through her engaging lectures and the many conversations we had, connecting our interests and daily lives to what we had learned in class.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to celebrating the&#160; Excellence in Teaching awards, COT also awarded </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/distinguished-teaching-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alegra Eroy-Reveles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an associate teaching professor in the Chemistry and Biochemistry department, the 2022-23 </span><a href="https://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cot-committee-on-teaching/cot-distinguished-teaching/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distinguished Teaching Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160; Based on nominations from faculty and colleagues, this award acknowledges pedagogical contributions that include but also go beyond any one course, in addition to recognizing an instructor who has made significant contributions to educational equity within and beyond UC Santa Cruz.&#160;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8d39266f807270464c03451ec7ac26ce"><name>audit-management-search</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Search for Director of Audit and Management Advisory Services</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is launching a national search for the director of Audit and Management Advisory Services.

<div>Contract negotiations between the United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters are at risk of stalling, potentially leading to a company-wide strike commencing on August 1, 2023. A <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/25/ups-teamsters-reach-contract-to-avoid-strike-union-says.html">tentative deal</a> between UPS and the union was reached today, decreasing the likelihood of a strike.<br/><br/>However, in the event that a strike does happen and there is a need to mitigate potential disruptions in receiving vital goods, UC Santa Cruz departments should consider exploring alternative delivery services or postponing purchases if UPS remains the sole supplier option.<br/><br/>In the event of a strike, all suppliers will be transitioning to alternate carriers, resulting in anticipated delays. To alleviate strain on these delivery services, staff should restrict purchases to essential items only.<br/><br/>In late 2022 some UPS locations refused to cross picket lines in sympathy with striking union employees. The decision to cross or not cross picket lines was made by each UPS sub-station and many behind the scenes delivery operations were not impacted. In contrast, this would be a UPS-wide strike and all packages would stop where they were until the end of the strike.&#160;</div>

They have built a database of childhood cancer tumor types, gathering patient data across institutions to better study the rare conditions and allow other researchers access to a more robust dataset.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I am continuously impressed and inspired by the passion, collaboration and commitment to change from everyone who is touched by pediatric cancer and hope that we will soon see the day when every child with cancer can expect a cure,&#8221; said Olena Vaske, associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental (MCD) biology and co-principal investigator at Treehouse.&#160;<br/><br/>With the new grant, Treehouse researchers will continue to build out their database with data from 25 studies on pediatric sarcomas, a rare and difficult-to-treat cancer type and work to make their database more accessible to researchers who do not have a computational background.&#160;<br/><br/>They also plan to create new programs to further study pediatric cancer tumors in order to find more treatment targets and move into clinical studies to ensure their approach can be used in clinics to treat children with cancer.&#160;<br/><br/>Treehouse was founded in 2013 by Vaske, Distinguished Professor of Biomolecular Engineering and Director of the Genomics Institute David Haussler, Professor of MCD Biology Sofie Salama, Project Scientist Melissa Cline, and Katrina Learned, then the quality assurance manager for the UCSC Genome Browser whose daughter had recently been diagnosed with&#160; cancer in her first year of life. Isabel Bjork, then-executive director of the Genomics Institute also contributed to the Treehouse leadership. Learned&#8217;s daughter thankfully survived, but learning first-hand about the research gap for childhood cancers motivated her, Vaske, and Haussler to look for new treatment options in RNA.&#160;<br/><br/>Thanks to the much-needed funding from&#160; <a href="https://www.stbaldricks.org/">St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation</a>, Treehouse has grown into a vibrant research program with multiple collaborators across the U.S. and internationally.&#160;</p>
<p>About St. Baldrick's:<br/>Every 2 minutes, a child somewhere in the world is diagnosed with cancer. In the U.S., 1 in 5 will not survive. The St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation, the largest charity funder of childhood cancer research grants, is on a mission to Conquer Kids&#8217; Cancer by supporting the most promising research to find cures and better treatments for all childhood cancers. When you give to St. Baldrick&#8217;s, you don&#8217;t just give to one hospital &#8211; you support virtually every institution with the expertise to treat kids with cancer across the U.S. St. Baldrick&#8217;s ensures that children fighting cancer now &#8212; and those diagnosed in the future &#8212; will have access to the most cutting-edge treatment, by supporting every stage of research, from new ideas in the lab to the training of the next generation of researchers, to lifesaving clinical trials.

However, her achievements and experiences as a transfer student at UC Santa Cruz make her unique. In addition to receiving both the 2023 Chancellor&#8217;s Award and the divisional Dean&#8217;s Award for her senior thesis, Ortiz is also a recipient of the 2023 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSF </span><a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graduate Research Fellowship Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GRFP) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grant, supporting her graduate studies and research at the Scripps Research Institute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NSF-GRFP is a competitive five-year fellowship with a long history of selecting recipients who achieve high levels of success in their future academic and professional careers. The program seeks to broaden participation in science and engineering of underrepresented groups and ensures the quality, vitality, and diversity of the scientific and engineering workforce of the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Ortiz received a 2023 Dean's Award from her incoming Ph.D. institution, Scripps Research Institute, as well as awards for outstanding research presentations at two national <a href="https://www.sacnas.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SACNAS </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Society of Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">conferences in 2019 and 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortiz transferred to UC Santa Cruz from Monterey Peninsula College. She quickly got involved in the </span><a href="https://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEM Diversity Research Programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by becoming a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) scholar and the outreach coordinator for the UCSC SACNAS chapter. She was also a guest speaker for workshops hosted by the STEM Diversity Programs aimed at demystifying the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSF-GRFP </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">application process and she shared her experience participating in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at a different institution.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The STEM Diversity team is incredible,&#8221; Ortiz said. &#8220;They really help students to believe in themselves and to strive for success. I would highly recommend students to apply to be part of this wonderful community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the realm of research, Ortiz worked in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Needhi Bhalla's lab. She worked on projects that involved investigating chromosome dynamics using </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caenorhabditis elegans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. elegans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as a model to visualize meiotic progression in different mutant conditions to investigate meiotic protein function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was phenomenal,&#8221; Ortiz said. &#8220;The lab is full of scientists who are caring, passionate and in the pursuit of diversifying science.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning this fall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortiz will pursue a Ph.D. in Chemical and Biological Sciences at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, California.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for her long-term career goals, Ortiz said she also wants to help more students enter research fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides completing my Ph.D. program, I also want to create an avenue for minority and disabled students to pursue research as a career.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ortiz said she couldn&#8217;t have accomplished her achievements without her supporters.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I appreciate the guidance and unconditional support of my friends, family, and mentors, including Dr. Bhalla and lab members, Dr. Russo, Dr. Turner, Yuli, Xingci, Dani, and the STEM Diversity community. I&#8217;d also like to extend a huge thank you to my funding sources, including the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Award, Simpson Physical Science Fund Fellowship, and the NIH-MARC program.&#8221;</span></p>

The findings, published in the journal </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adg3377"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Advances</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggest that the servants who lived, worked, and died at Machu Picchu were a diverse community representing many different ancestral backgrounds throughout the Inca Empire. And the remarkable extent of this diversity may even challenge historical narratives about how the empire grew.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholars believe Machu Picchu was a royal estate connected to the lineage of Pachacuti, the emperor credited with establishing the Inca Empire. Royals visited Machu Picchu seasonally, but a community of servants lived there year-round to take care of the facilities. Servants were buried in caves and rock shelters outside the palace walls. The research team analyzed DNA from 34 of these individuals, as well as a comparison group of ancient burials from rural sites in the broader Urubamba Valley and the nearby city of Cusco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This study does not focus on the life of &#8216;royals&#8217; or political elites, but on the life of those who were brought to Machu Picchu to serve the nobility and who lived there and operated the place,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Anthropology Professor Lars Fehren-Schmitz, a senior and corresponding author on the new paper. &#8220;It gives us a unique insight into a highly diverse community of individuals and their families who were subject to Inca forced relocation and resettlement policies, a group usually referred to as retainers or yanacona.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers from Yale, Universidad Nacional de San Antonio Aba del Cusco (UNSAAC), UC Santa Cruz, Tulane University, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and others conducted the study, under an agreement between Yale, the State of Peru, and the University of Cusco to return artifacts and human remains from the Hiram Bingham Expedition collection back to Cusco, Peru. The team&#8217;s work builds upon previous archeological and bio-archaeological research, including a 2021 study that determined the age of Machu Picchu (AD 1420-1530).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the current study, Fehren-Schmitz and scientists at the UC Santa Cruz Paleogenomics Lab and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology extracted ancient DNA samples from the teeth of those buried at Machu Picchu and the comparison sites. The human remains at Machu Picchu had been exposed to the elements for centuries, which meant that the DNA was highly degraded. But it was still able to be processed and sequenced thanks to specialized techniques developed at UC Santa Cruz, Fehren-Schmitz said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA from the samples was then compared with that of modern people across South and Central America and ancient people across South America. This allowed the team to identify the most likely ancestry of Machu Picchu&#8217;s residents and draw conclusions about how the community differed from others in the region before, during, and after the Inca Empire.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings showed that Machu Picchu was a uniquely diverse community, which is consistent with both historical accounts of how servants were selected from across the empire and prior research that found non-local isotopic signatures and cultural identifiers among the dead. But the DNA analysis also revealed a surprisingly wide geographic range of ancestries. Servants had genetic ties throughout the Andean highlands, along the North and South Peruvian coast, and in Amazonian regions of Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An unexpected result was the finding that many of the retainers were of Amazonian origin and about a third of them have DNA reflecting significant amounts of Amazonian ancestry,&#8221; said lead author Lucy Salazar, a research associate at Yale. &#8220;At least two zones within the Amazonian region are represented.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team&#8217;s DNA evidence suggests that people from far-flung corners of the Inca Empire had been living at Machu Picchu since the site&#8217;s earliest occupation, which could indicate that the empire expanded earlier, or in different ways, than described in historical chronologies. This adds to a growing sentiment among Inca specialists that emerging archaeological evidence does not match dominant historical narratives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Traditional chronologies tell a story about how Emperor Pachacuti slowly started to expand the Inca Empire and then built Machu Picchu,&#8221; Fehren-Schmitz explained. &#8220;But in this study, we see that people from regions that are supposed to have been integrated into the Inca Empire later on seem to have actually already been interacting with the Inca at this point in time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important finding was that many of the people buried at Machu Picchu had mixed ancestries, often from regions distant from each other. This suggests that servants at Machu Picchu from different genetic groups had children together. Servants of different ancestries were also buried together.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archaeologist Richard Burger, Yale&#8217;s lead researcher for the Machu Picchu project, said DNA evidence ultimately helps to paint a picture of Machu Picchu as a &#8220;cosmopolitan community,&#8221; where diverse genetic backgrounds intermixed in life and in death.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Fujioka&#8217;s (Crown &#8217;74, sociology) life in civil service is a storied one.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His public service career can be traced back to the 1970s when he worked as a custodian and gardener while pursuing his degree from UC Santa Cruz. Now, over five decades later, Fujioka&#8217;s career includes work as Los Angeles&#8217;s City Administrative Officer, the first-ever Chief Executive Officer of the city, and his current role as the Chair of the Los Angeles Japanese American National Museum (JANM).&#160; &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fujioka came out of retirement to join the Board of Trustees for JANM and eventually was selected to be the Board Chair.&#160; For him, the decision to join the JANM Board was an unsurprising one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I strongly feel it&#8217;s my generation&#8217;s responsibility to not only preserve our history, but to retell that history to ensure what happened to my community in 1942, never happens again to any other vulnerable community.&#160; I'm going to be outspoken, because in some communities, there&#8217;s a tendency to pull back a little bit," Fujioka says. "I've never been that way. I wouldn't have gotten to my last two positions in government by being the shy retiring type."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fujioka succeeds Secretary Norman Mineta as chair of the Japanese American National Museum. Mineta&#8217;s legacy for the civil liberties of Japanese Americans is incomparable, and Fujioka finds inspiration and motivation for his work as Chair of JANM in his succession of Mineta.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese American National Museum was established in 1992 and is dedicated to preserving the history and culture of Japanese Americans. It also serves as a monument of the wrongful persecution of Japanese Americans nationwide. The courtyard of the museum was the location where Japanese Americans were forced onto buses and taken away to assembly centers and internment camps across the country. Fujioka&#8217;s family were forced onto buses at this site.&#160; For Fujioka, the site of this horrible act can serve both as a platform for future change and to honor the great accomplishments of his predecessor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JANM plans to rename the courtyard as the Norm Mineta Plaza for Democracy.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'm hoping that the Japanese American National Museum becomes a place where people convene, because when I see the plaza, I see a town square, where people can come together and just talk," Fujioka says. "I also see the National Center for Preservation Democracy, a place where people with diverse feelings and on a multitude of issues could come together, and sit down and talk about democracy, because we're losing it now. A place for the community to have a safe place where they can come together."</span></p>
<h3><strong>From Los Angeles to Santa Cruz, and back again</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Fujioka set out on his collegiate journey, his decision to make a move far from the busy streets of Southern California to the forests of UC Santa Cruz was entirely intentional.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fujioka recounts his youth in LA among street gangs, and how his father urged Fujioka to leave town to pursue his education. This was a hard choice for Fujioka, but once he immersed himself in UCSC&#8217;s academics and campus, he quickly grew to appreciate his future alma mater.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The first year or two was difficult for me, but my last two years, I loved it," says Fujioka. "I loved the environment, I loved academic freedom. This one professor, the Dean of the School of Sociology, Dennis McElrath; I don't think he knows to this day what kind of impression he made on me: I took several classes with him, and he lit a fire."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having his passion for public service sparked at UCSC, Fujioka hopes to encourage and enlighten students working towards his same path to the impact that their work can create.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You&#8217;re always going to hear me say that I want to shout the benefits of public service, because you can impact lives. when it's all said and done, that's what it's all about: You can make someone else's life better."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Above all, Fujioka credits UC Santa Cruz with giving him a bedrock to launch his career into local government and public service upon his return to Los Angeles. Coming from Los Angeles as a self-described average student, Fujioka looks back at his time spent learning at UCSC as fundamental to his future at one of the highest levels of public service. He ended up graduating earning a degree with honors in sociology. Several years ago, he was recognized as one of the top 45 graduates from UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I was an average student when I got accepted there. I was happy to go to Santa Cruz, it was brand new, and then I went on to have a great public service career. But most importantly, I think because of growing up in the 70s at UC Santa Cruz, it taught us about respecting others. It laid that foundation. I truly loved my time and experience at UCSC."</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="98ecedfd8072704666211be269df814a"><name>in-memoriam-may-diaz</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: May N.

Diaz, the second Provost of Kresge College, died at the age of 102. In her long career, she was a mentor to many graduate students and junior faculty and an acclaimed scholar, who shaped the fields of peasant anthropology and women&#8217;s studies. She came to the campus as a full professor, after founding and directing the UC Berkeley Center for Continuing Education of Women, one of the first women&#8217;s studies outreach programs in the country. As Kresge College provost, she was one of the first women administrators on our campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May authored </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tonal&#225;: Conservatism, Responsibility, and Authority in a Mexican Town, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a study of peasant life in Mexico that showed small-scale rural communities&#8217; integration in wider economic and political systems, and she was co-editor of the classic work on peasants, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peasant Society</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with George Foster and Jack Potter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noted for her dedication to openness and honesty in her ethnographic research, May carried that same ethic into her work on the campus. Her graduate students, who include Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Ben Orlove, Setha Low, Mario Davilla, and Mischa Adams, appreciated her &#8220;deep commitment to scholarship, thought, and action,&#8221; called her a &#8220;fierce, frank, funny, feminist,&#8221; and always found comfort and support in her office. May was more than a role-model to young women on the faculty. She actively engaged their ideas, listened to their problems, and helped them set boundaries that would balance their academic and family commitments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May began her graduate studies as a wife, married to Bill Diaz, an outspoken advocate of workers&#8217; rights, and as a mother of two young sons. Those family connections, her deep-seated communitarian values, and her dedication to understanding how individuals, as well as societies, are shaped by their political economies made May Diaz an outstanding anthropologist and a beloved friend, mentor, and colleague.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9d6c703d80727046275cb47b4677632b"><name>eng-cccrgrants</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Engineering faculty take on innovative climate resilience projects </title><summary>Engineering professors are leading three major projects to address climate crisis issues with funding from UCSC’s newly launched Center for Coastal Climate Resilience. &#13;

All three of the projects led by engineering faculty are pilot awards, meaning they were previously unfunded efforts to address climate impacts and solutions.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We are very excited about these new initiatives as we continue to build capacity, expertise and partnerships,&#8221; said Anne Criss, Assistant Dean of the Baskin School of Engineering who is coordinating climate change-related projects at the school. &#8220;Engineering is here to provide meaningful contributions to improving our resilience to climate change, playing an essential role not only in finding technical solutions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also in helping coastal communities adapt to our changing climate.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Coastal Monitoring&#160;</strong><br/><br/>Principal Investigator: Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Alex Pang&#160;<br/>Co-Investigators: Associate Research Professor of Institute of Marine Sciences Borja Reguero<br/>Collaborators: &#160;Professor of Environmental Studies and Director of the Coastal Science and Policy Program Anne Kapuscinski, Senior Scientist at NOAA Gregory Dusek, Research Geologist at USGS Jonathan Warrick, and David Gutierrez of Solutions and Services.<br/><br/>Sea level rise poses a great threat to coastal communities such as Santa Cruz, and a prerequisite for protecting those communities is a deep understanding of those threats and the risks they pose. This project will employ a machine learning-based algorithm to analyze changes in the Santa Cruz shoreline and nearshore dynamics such as rip currents using video from a network of webcams in the study area. The shoreline data captured at various time scales and rip current occurrence data can be used for climate modeling, prediction, and policy making, such as long-term studies on sea level rise and rip currents to help with beach safety. The software will be open source so it can be replicated for other settings and extended for future projects.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Greener Greenhouses&#160;</strong><br/><br/>Principal Investigator: Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Katia Obraczka<br/>Co-Investigators: Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Colleen Josephson, Professor of Environmental Studies Michael Loik, Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Merced Wan Du<br/><br/>As extreme weather threatens agricultural production and about a third of the world&#8217;s population does not have access to adequate food, greenhouses are an important aspect of climate resilience in the global food production system. Katia Obraczka and her team will develop greenhouses equipped with an Internet of Things system that continuously monitors conditions such as airflow, temperature, humidity or light throughout the greenhouse to optimize resource usage such as water and fertilizer, while improving food production. The system will employ LiFi, a low-power wireless communication technology that uses light waves emitted by LEDs for&#160; ultra-low-power and efficient communication. LEDs will also be used to provide supplemental illumination for the plants as well as energy sources for the light-powered IoT sensing nodes. The LiFi IoT will also be used to control greenhouse elements such as vents, lights, and irrigation pumps. The LiFi-based IoT technology will be open source, making it accessible to small, local farmers. Ultimately, the team hopes to show that plants grow as well or better in greener greenhouses than current methods, while&#160; reducing the amount of water, electricity, and labor used to grow healthy food in addition to operating battery-free.<br/><br/><strong>Firefighter Toolkits</strong><br/><br/>Principal Investigator: Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Ricardo Sanfelice&#160;<br/>Co-Investigators: Director of the CITRIS Initiative for Drone Research Becca Fenwick, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley Michael Gollner, Professor of Computational Media Katherine Ibister, Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Steve McGuire, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Katia Obraczka, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley Raja Sengupta (UCB), Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley Kenichi Soga, and co-founder and director of the Monterey Bay Drone, Automation and Robotics Technology initiative Chris Bley.&#160;<br/><br/>Extreme wildfires have increasingly plagued communities throughout the US and across the world, from Santa Cruz to Canada to the Australian outback. And though wildfires are a natural element of a healthy ecosystem, droughts, climate change, and the buildup of fuels have made them more severe. Ricardo Sanfelice and his team plan to take advantage of recent technological advances to create an innovative system for wildfire prevention, prediction, management, and suppression using aviation, communication, sensing, and decision-making technology. The system will provide ongoing information about environmental factors including wind speed and direction, potential actions, and patterns. It will also efficiently guide the deployment of firefighters, their vehicles and resources, and other assets. The goal is to have these systems be easily integrated into existing toolkits used by firefighters, and to provide training curriculum and policy recommendations for its implementation. In the pilot phase of this project, the researchers will focus on developing a suite of software, deploying aircrafts for data collection in high-risk areas of California, and beginning the creation of curriculum and policy.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9de55cdc80727046275cb47b79af4119"><name>lals-grad-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Latin American &amp; Latino Studies students win big in awards, fellowships</title><summary>Four doctoral candidates in the Latin American and Latino Studies Department received awards that will help propel them forward in their graduate trajectory.</summary><start-date>1690527600000</start-date><path>/2023/07/lals-grad-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/lals-grad-awards</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1690571201736</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1690571201736</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Grace Stetson</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/jimenez-150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/jimenez-150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jimenez-150.jpg</name><display-name>jimenez-150.jpg</display-name><file-size>30214</file-size><width>150</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Brittney Jimenez</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/jimenez-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/jimenez-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jimenez-80.jpg</name><display-name>jimenez-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20038</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Brittney Jimenez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brittney Jimenez</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/delgadillo.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/delgadillo.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>delgadillo.jpeg</name><display-name>delgadillo.jpeg</display-name><file-size>4912</file-size><width>150</width><height>150</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Rafael E.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awardees from the division include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Rafael E. Delgadillo</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, President&#8217;s Dissertation Year Award</span></li>

<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Brittney Jimenez</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Crossing Latinidades Summer Institute Fellowship</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to one of the awardees, &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to make the best of this fellowship in the coming year.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rafael E. Delgadillo</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delgadillo has had a winding path to get to UC Santa Cruz&#8212;and his most recent recognition as the winner of President&#8217;s Dissertation Year Award will help the doctoral candidate back to the West Coast to round out his graduate experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Orleans native grew up in a Dominican household and worked to balance the relationship between the Big Easy with the history of colonization of the Caribbean. With all of the integrated backgrounds and ethnicities that came together in New Orleans, Delgadillo referred to his hometown as a city that should not be defined as a place that is merely on the geographic and cultural periphery of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The city&#8217;s history is really reflective of the entire hemisphere, as a colonial project, because of the way New Orleans was founded,&#8221; he said. Delgadillo&#8217;s doctoral research is also heavily concerned with the city&#8217;s commercial and cultural connections with Caribbean and Latin American port cities after the Louisiana Purchase.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That basic understanding fueled Delgadillo&#8217;s research, leading to him earn both a bachelor&#8217;s and a master&#8217;s degree in history from the University of New Orleans. Those experiences helped him to learn more about research and archiving. That coincided with his career as a community organizer, where he worked with Latino communities in southeast Louisiana that became integral to rebuilding the region in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Many of the construction workers and service industry employees were newly arrived migrants from Latin America.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a chance meeting with another scholar at Tulane University in 2009 that led Delgadillo to actually make the leap to Santa Cruz, when he was informed of the new LALS Ph.D. program set to start in 2014.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the only program I applied to, and I got in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Living in Santa Cruz, doing this research there, that has been very healing&#8230;it&#8217;s a passion for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delgadillo is now entering his seventh year of doctoral candidacy. With this most recent award, he will return to the area after conducting research in the Southeast, finalize his dissertation, and begin his job search.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karina Ruiz</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruiz, currently in her sixth year of her doctoral program, focuses her research on childhood studies and family studies in the context of Latino mixed-status families. Her work focuses on children&#8217;s emotional labor and care work in mixed-status and transnational families, areas she&#8217;s expanded on since her undergraduate program at CSU Monterey Bay.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her UC President&#8217;s Pre-Professoriate Fellowship, she&#8217;ll be able to spend more time on dissertation writing and prepare for her next steps post-graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was interested in garnering more in these topic areas when entering the division, largely because she had been connecting research from childhood studies to her own experiences in an immigrant family and years of experience in the childcare field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She worked further in developing her research and insights on this area through her work with </span><a href="https://webelongproject.sites.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the We Belong Project,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a collaborative and community-engaged research project designed to document the experiences of immigrant families, their contributions, and the obstacles they face.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In doing this work in both Santa Cruz County and the greater Silicon Valley, Ruiz has found a great deal of imperative organizations working diligently to provide for the community, including Second Harvest and United Way Santa Cruz County. With her recent award, she&#8217;s excited to further give back to the community through her research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice opportunity to take a break and spend some time focusing on the research too,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brittney Jimenez</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimenez, in her second year of her Ph.D. program, focuses on the contemporary Chicano movement and young women involved in the movements, as well as how histories of the movement are used in current activism endeavors. As part of her recent award of the Crossing Latinidades Summer Research Fellowship, she will take this summer to connect with other students and professors from other universities as she furthers her own research.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her master&#8217;s program at CSU Northridge, she was in community with a lot of young women, asking how the discipline influenced the movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It really made me consider how I identified, and how those partnerships impacted the ways I see my educational journey and activist journey today,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Summer Institute will allow Jimenez and other students to take time to assess methodological and theoretical frameworks related to their research, and connect with research working groups. As part of the Institute, students will take part in an end-of-summer research presentation, held at the University of Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having the advice of advisors here has been instrumental in me being able to continue in this work and feel supported in it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about the prospect of building communities in this program.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amando Argueta-Vogel</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argueta-Vogel will join his fellow UCSC doctoral candidate Jimenez this summer, as a recipient of the Crossing Latinidades Summer Institute Fellowship. His doctoral study focuses on Central American Studies&#8212;particularly the social, political and economic relationships between the U.S. and Central America&#8212;as understood through the lenses of both immigration and migration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argueta-Vogel is no stranger to award recognition and has garnered significant praise for his research efforts over the past academic year. In May, he was announced as one of the 11 graduate student research grant recipients from the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas, for his publication &#8220;Migrations Otherwise and Studies of Central American Mobility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of his studies, Argueta-Vogel is also a graduate student researcher for the Global Latinidades Center at UC Santa Barbara.&#160;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trio of UC Santa Cruz alumni,&#160; Lisa Rose, Jim Lapsley, and Susan Nerton,&#160; led a campaign to raise over $1M for the Crown College Endowment fund. With the help of 60+ of&#160; their fellow pioneer alumni they surpassed their goal in July.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign ended with a total of $1,011,000 raised for the Crown College Endowment with some funds allocated to the Provost&#8217;s Discretionary Fund available for immediate use.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a major accomplishment for Crown&#8221; said Crown College Provost Manel Camps. &#8220;This will ensure that Crown College has substantial resources to develop its mission for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the university&#8217;s ten colleges has their own endowment fund that is used at the discretion of the college provost to fund courses, activities, and more. As long-standing members of the Crown Provost Advising Committee, Rose, Lapsley, and Nerton took it upon themselves to bolster its fund to ensure support for current and future students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crown College endowment is one of the facets the college uses to help pay for a variety of courses offered through Crown that support student academic success and professional development, as well as activities aimed at fostering student wellbeing. Crown endowment funds give students the intellectual and practical tools to succeed well after graduating from UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The demands for what is needed for the students are going to change over time,&#8221; Lapsley said. &#8220;What we've been able to do now is to top up the endowment fund, so that there will be a stable amount of money that the provost can count on. This will have some impactful changes in the freshman year with core courses and create some other new classes that are both academic and necessary.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost Camps says that the funds raised by alumni will contribute an additional $50,000 each year for Crown College to utilize for the purchase of materials/reagents for class projects, student attendance to conferences,improved preparation of core courses for frosh, and to give Crown faculty the opportunity to develop and teach elective courses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These funds really help provide an additional dimension for our faculty&#8217;s teachings,&#8221; Camps said. &#8220;Because otherwise our faculty would only be teaching Core Courses, but they bring so much more to the table in their respective fields.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of areas already covered by elective courses at Crown include classes in entrepreneurship, communication skills, and digital literacy, see </span><a href="https://catalog.ucsc.edu/en/current/general-catalog/academic-units/the-colleges/crown-college/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> . Because of their success, these classes often attract funding from other sources on campus, effectively multiplying the impact of gift funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The substantial growth in Crown&#8217;s endowment will also open the door to the development of alumni and emeriti faculty-supported programs, the design of programs targeting transfer students, and will enable a significant expansion of faculty-mentored internship programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Manel is going to be able to continue thinking creatively and creating excellent experiences for students at the college level and to help return the college's more academic focus,&#8221; Nerton said. &#8220;That just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lights me up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when I think about it because for my intellectual development, Crown College was at the forefront.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Camps says he is very grateful to all the alumni that supported the Crown College Endowment campaign, and to Lisa Rose, Susan Nerton, and Jim Lapsley in particular for leading this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This group of alumni understood from the get-go that for colleges, the most effective help that we can receive are discretionary resources. I didn&#8217;t ask them to focus on fundraising, there was no expectation on my part, they just knew what would make a difference for Crown College and went for it. That is truly extraordinary.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Getting to the $1M finish line</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio&#8217;s efforts can be traced back to the 2022 Alumni Reunion Weekend. Soon after the 50th reunion event&#8212;which they organized&#8212; Rose, Lapsley, and Nerton began reaching out to their fellow classmates with personalized emails and phone calls. Jim Lapsley took the time to personally call dozens of alumni to talk to them about the endowment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio emphasized that the campaign wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the help of an anonymous donor, who donated $400,000 and matched every gift made through December 2022.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ad46904a807270461b5c85dd968b4072"><name>slugloop-google-solution-challenge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC students behind bus tracking app selected as only U.S. team in Google Solution Challenge’s top 10</title><summary>The competition, which invites thousands of students worldwide to compete, tasks students to come up with technical solutions that contribute to the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development goals.</summary><start-date>1690830000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC students selected into Google Solution Challenge’s top 10</display-name><path>/2023/07/slugloop-google-solution-challenge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/slugloop-google-solution-challenge</link><created-by>mweckerl</created-by><created-on>1690829230136</created-on><last-modified-by>mweckerl</last-modified-by><last-modified>1690830135941</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa Weckerle</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/cruzhacks-slugloop.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/cruzhacks-slugloop.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cruzhacks-slugloop.jpg</name><display-name>cruzhacks-slugloop.jpg</display-name><file-size>120877</file-size><width>300</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>SlugLoop team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/07/images/thumbnail-slug-loop.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/07/images/thumbnail-slug-loop.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>thumbnail-slug-loop.jpg</name><display-name>thumbnail-slug-loop.jpg</display-name><file-size>22532</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>SlugLoop team</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SlugLoop team during CruzHacks 2023, where they built their first proof of concept and were awarded a &#8220;Best Use of Github&#8221; prize.</span></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="https://www.slugloop.tech/">SlugLoop</a>, an innovative real-time bus tracking app developed by a team of four UC Santa Cruz Baskin Engineering students, has been selected into the top 10 of the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge">2023 Google Solution Challenge</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>The annual competition invites thousands of students from around the world to develop Google-based technical solutions that support one or more of the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge/UN-goals">United Nations&#8217; (UN) 17 Sustainable Development Goals</a>. The Baskin Engineering team, which is the only U.S. team selected into the top 10, will present their project to a panel of industry leaders on August 3.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being selected among the top 10 finalists has been an exciting experience for our team,&#8221; said SlugLoop front-end developer and UCSC student&#160;Alex Liu. &#8220;We take immense pride in what we have collectively achieved and are thankful to Baskin Engineering Professor Kerry Veenstra for assisting us throughout the development process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the local Santa Cruz Metro bus routes are trackable, there is currently no tracking system in place for the UCSC Loop bus, which is the primary public transit system on campus. The SlugLoop team set out to solve this problem by developing an app that allows students to easily and in real time track bus locations for both UCSC&#8217;s Loop buses and the Santa Cruz Metro bus lines that circle campus, providing an opportunity to plan ahead and stay informed.</p>
<p>Engineering students Bill Zhang, Alex Liu, Annie Liu, and Nick Szwed first came up with the idea of SlugLoop after reading a Reddit thread that spoke to student frustration with the UC Santa Cruz campus bus system. They wanted to provide a solution to the issues students faced, from unpredictable route schedules and overcrowding to long wait times and missed buses, while still promoting public transit as one of the most sustainable transportation options.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s system, which came to fruition during their participation in<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://cruzhacks.com/">CruzHacks 2023</a>, works first by employing GPS trackers and transceivers on the buses and buildings around campus to collect bus route location information. Because there was once a bus tracking system in place on campus, they were able to get campus permission to make changes on some of the previously installed hardware to meet the needs of their app.&#160;</p>
<p>Once the bus location data is collected, it then gets sent to a custom server and database that is later retrieved and displayed through Google Maps API, allowing real-time, bus tracking information to be displayed on the front end of the app.</p>
<p>In addition to creating a positive campus transportation experience for UCSC students, the team&#8217;s technical solution addresses three of the UN&#8217;s 17 sustainable development goals: quality education (goal #4), sustainable cities and communities (goal #11), and climate action (goal #13).</p>
<p>&#8220;We attribute our success to actively listening to and valuing student feedback throughout the development process,&#8221; said Zhang, the team's full stack developer. &#8220;By incorporating their suggestions, we ensured that SlugLoop became a highly relevant and valuable tool for our users, resulting in an improved user experience and widespread adoption.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the team gets ready for Demo Day, they are excited to connect with the other finalists, gain valuable feedback from industry leaders, and discover innovative ways to transform their app.</p>

But their precision &#8212; which is often within the tens of meters &#8212; depends in part on the return of their friends. A new study, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that the death of flockmates tends to weaken a golden-crowned sparrow&#8217;s connection to an overwintering site, while the number of winters spent there tends to strengthen it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research, conducted at the University of California, Santa Cruz Arboretum, uses ten years of golden-crowned sparrow data to improve ecologists&#8217; understanding of social structure and overwintering behavior. UC Santa Cruz Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Bruce Lyon initially began the sparrow observations as a lab course. Daizaburo Shizuka and Alexis S. Chaine, former graduate students who are co-authors on the paper with Lyon, helped grow it into a long-term monitoring and bird-banding program. Over the last twenty years, the program has involved nearly 100 UC Santa Cruz undergraduate students in data collection and resulted in multiple papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One previous study from the site revealed almost primate-like communities within the overwintering sparrow population. The flocks change over time, but some birds very clearly stay together. The golden-crowned sparrows&#8217; connections are not related to kinship. That complex social structure prompted the researchers to ask whether the birds come back each year because of an attachment to the space or to their flockmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To answer that question, they collected ten years of behavioral observations and compared changes in site fidelity &#8212; how precisely sparrows return to one location &#8212; to demographic turnover &#8212; who returns and who does not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These birds migrate thousands of miles to Alaska and northern Canada and then come back to pretty much the same set of bushes. That&#8217;s pretty astonishing,&#8221; said Lyon. &#8220;This paper showed that at least part of that fidelity is to return to be with their winter friends.&#8221; He adds that it was Shizuka&#8217;s expertise in social network analysis that opened the door for the study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team took observations from 2009 to 2019. They determined the spatial fidelity of individual birds to their wintering sites and identified close flockmates for each bird. They then compared how different variables affected that spatial fidelity. Sex and dominance status did not seem to play a role in whether a sparrow returned to the same spot. But the number of winters spent at a site and the loss of close flockmates did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These birds go off to Alaska, and only about 50% return,&#8221; said Lyon. &#8220;All those connections disappear, and that has implications.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors speculate that long-term relationships with flockmates provide benefits to the sparrows that accumulate over an individual&#8217;s lifetime. Evidence shows that birds who know each other cooperate in foraging flocks and fight less. Researchers don&#8217;t yet know why site fidelity increases over several seasons, but it might be that strong familiarity with a location provides benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study adds to the limited body of work surrounding wintering behavior and social structure in birds. While many birds exhibit site fidelity, teasing out what brings them back to the same spot each year is more challenging for some species than others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We got lucky,&#8221; said Lyon. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great study site, and the birds are easy to work with, but it would be pretty challenging to study other groups that might do this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term banding and monitoring program will continue at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. Lyon and colleagues plan to turn their attention to physiology studies soon, but they maintain that researchers should continue trying to understand social structure and behavior. This type of data can help ecologists make projections about whether populations are declining or stable, Lyon explains. And there are likely still surprises to be discovered.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The fact that the sparrows overlap in structure, at least superficially, with primates and lots of other things is interesting,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And it means that we still don't really understand what the drivers are.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="0936f14d80727046405ab490d0720009"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2023/07/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/07/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1670896873793</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1671833431027</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
