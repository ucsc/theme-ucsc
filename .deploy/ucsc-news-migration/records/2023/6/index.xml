</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Latino Alumni Network&#8212;an alumni organization designed to connect the UCSC Latinx community&#8212;is ready to make its comeback as a hub for Latinx alumni under the direction of new Co-Chairs Guadalupe Sanchez and Amaris Trujillo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fueled by fresh ideas and a passion for reconnecting with their alma mater, fellow alums, and current students, the two alumni are excited to jumpstart LAN and its potential for lasting impact.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be able to serve all of the communities that will pass through this organization, whether it&#8217;s other </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alumni, current students, or prospective students,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to be a part of this experience alongside Amaris.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Director of Alumni Diversity Programs Monica Armstrong is thrilled to announce Sanchez and Trujillo as the program&#8217;s new Co-Chairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Amaris and Guadalupe are perfect for the job,&#8221; Armstrong said. &#8220;Their goals will propel the Latino Alumni Network forward. We&#8217;re grateful to have such inspirational alumni spearheading the revival of the Latino Alumni Network at UCSC.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Co-chairs emphasize that they want LAN to become a space for Latinx alumni and students to build community and find resources. They hope the organization will provide professional development events, a mentorship program with Latinx alumni and undergraduate students, and a series of guest speaker events highlighting Latinx alumni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our community faces many obstacles when navigating higher education and the professional workforce,&#8221; Trujillo said. &#8220;So I hope that with LAN&#8217;s presence, we can contribute positively, whether that&#8217;s through providing resources or supporting the ones currently in place, advocating for change, or simply creating a space for us to find community.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Guadalupe Sanchez&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a student, Sanchez interned with El Centro, the Chicanx/Latinx resource center at UCSC. She said being with a community of other Latinx students and mentors made her feel more at home on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a part of El Centro was very impactful for me because I was able to find my community within UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;When I first started at UCSC, I felt very alienated and like nobody looked like me. When I found all these people with similar experiences, it was life-changing, and I felt comfortable. It felt like the campus was actually catering to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to interning with El Centro, Sanchez worked in the admissions office as a frontline student advisor all four years at UCSC. She said that her experience working with admissions motivated her to pursue a career in higher education, specifically in admissions work. Sanchez graduated from UCSC in 2013 with a BA in film and digital media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working with the Santa Cruz Mountains Winegrowers Association&#160; for two years post-graduation, Sanchez landed her first role in admissions at the University of Texas, San Antonio. She then served&#160; as the Assistant Director of Multicultural Recruitment&#160; for Radford University in&#160; Virginia, where she worked with many Hispanic and Latino students in their pursuit of higher education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Sanchez works as an Outreach Specialist for UC Scout, a University of California program that offers A-G approved and AP level courses and curricula for high school students. In her role, Sanchez collaborates closely with school districts across California to provide access to high quality courses that support students with increasing A-G completion, thereby enhancing their eligibility for admissions to both the California State University (CSU) and University of California (UC) systems. Sanchez strives to provide students with the necessary resources and opportunities to excel academically and reach their educational goals.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez is excited to further reconnect with her alma mater as a LAN Co-chair and support the Latinx alumni community, as well as, prospective and current students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having a network to guide you through your young professional career is really valuable,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;On top of supporting alumni, one of the things we want to do with LAN is support students on campus and ensure that they have a successful college experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Amaris Trujillo</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amaris&#8217;s passion for volunteerism motivated her to take on the role of LAN Co-Chair.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a student at UCSC, Trujillo was the Co-President of Slug Shelter, a student-led organization focused on assisting the homeless student population in Santa Cruz, and was a mentor through the UCSC Slug Mentor Network.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also joined the First-Generation Initiative, and became a program coordinator. She worked closely with first-generation college students by guiding them to resources and highlighting the stories of the first-gen community at UCSC. She said one of her proudest moments was organizing the first UC System-wide First-Generation College Student Conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a first-generation college student, I have come to appreciate the variety of resources and experiences UC Santa Cruz has had to offer me. My first quarter at UCSC was difficult as I often questioned my abilities and place in higher education as the first in my family to attend college. It wasn&#8217;t until I started attending meetings at the UCSC First Generation Initiative that I found confidence and a sense of community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her final year at UCSC, Trujillo became a Human Rights Investigator for the UCSC Investigations Lab, where she investigated human rights violations in Latin America for non-government organizations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trujillo graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2022 with BA&#8217;s in legal studies and psychology and a minor in Latin American and Latino studies. Earlier this year, she began working as a Legal Clerk at the San Joaquin County Superior Court&#8217;s Criminal Department.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although my future plans for my career have many possibilities, I know that I will continue to advocate for what I believe is right and help others in any position that I acquire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She says her education from UCSC immensely helped her pursue her career path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had become close with faculty members, staff, and alumni who have, in one way or another, supported me in my career path, from writing letters of recommendation and being a reference on a job application to being a mentor when times were uncertain. All in all, my experiences at UCSC have positively impacted my career path for many years to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hopes that in addition to serving the Latinx community, LAN will become a space for first-generation students to feel at home at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe that having a strong Latinx alumni network at UCSC symbolizes the capabilities of what we can achieve as a community and, most importantly, to utilize the network to uplift Latinx undergraduates through our experiences in navigating higher education and the workforce. During my four years at UCSC, I have been the most impacted by the advice, testimonies, and mentorship from UCSC alumni.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Administered by the Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology (METX), the new program will begin admitting students in fall 2023.</p>
<p>Students in the microbiology major will study fundamental concepts in biology with a focus on microorganisms and will learn about the importance of microorganisms to life on Earth. They will gain an understanding of the impact of microorganisms on humans and the environment and learn about the applications of microbiology in human health, biotechnology, and environmental fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microorganisms are great model organisms for understanding fundamental biology, and because they are so prevalent there are many industrial, environmental, and medical applications from microbiology,&#8221; said Fitnat Yildiz, professor and chair of METX. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for students to understand their basic biology, how they function, and how we can use them for different purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microbiologists work in a wide variety of capacities, including in biomedical and environmental research; clinical and public health diagnostics labs; the biotechnology industry; and government positions in public health and policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Students with a microbiology degree are in a good position to either work immediately in industry or to get additional levels of training with M.S. and Ph.D. degrees,&#8221; Yildiz said.</p>
<p>Yildiz and METX Professor Victoria Auerbuch Stone, who led the development of the new major, worked with other METX faculty to develop new courses for the major. Because the study of microbiology requires an interdisciplinary approach, students will supplement their studies with courses in biochemistry and bioinformatics, and tailor their coursework with electives that can allow them to dive more deeply into medical microbiology, genomics, or ecology.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an amazing time to be studying microorganisms&#8212;it&#8217;s really a golden age for this field,&#8221; Yildiz said. &#8220;Using current technologies in microbiology is giving us a deep understanding and appreciation of microorganisms and of life in general. It&#8217;s an exciting field and a lot of fun.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://science.ucsc.edu/degree/microbiology/</url><title>UCSC Microbiology Degree</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7777bfe8807270464370ac8c09b13a68"><name>materials-science-engineering</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz now offers graduate degrees in materials science and engineering</title><summary>The interdisciplinary program will serve students interested in developing new materials for next-generation technologies.</summary><keywords>David Lederman</keywords><start-date>1685602800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz now offers graduate degrees in materials science and engineering</display-name><path>/2023/06/materials-science-engineering</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/06/materials-science-engineering</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1685631516624</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1685631752289</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/mse-lab-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/mse-lab-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mse-lab-500.jpg</name><display-name>mse-lab-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>122499</file-size><width>500</width><height>353</height></image><image-alt>researchers in white coveralls in lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/mse-lab-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/mse-lab-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mse-lab-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mse-lab-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24646</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>researchers in white coveralls in lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Researchers in a materials science laboratory at UC Santa Cruz, where graduate degrees are now offered in materials science and engineering.

Administered jointly by the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Baskin School of Engineering, the new program aims to begin enrolling graduate students in fall 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;This exciting new program will allow us to attract cohorts of talented students interested in researching and developing materials for innovative sustainable technologies that are highly relevant to our changing world,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;Combining the strengths of engineering and science at UCSC will prepare students to excel in crucial, sought-after careers of the future and lead to important advances in research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Physics Professor David Lederman, who led the development of the new graduate program, said he has seen a lot of student interest in this field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Materials science and engineering is a very relevant field now for important areas of technological development, including the semiconductor industry, low-power electronics, renewable energy technologies, and quantum computing and quantum sensors,&#8221; Lederman said. &#8220;All those things rely on having new materials with the functionality required for the next generation of advanced technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of these technologies are crucial for attaining sustainable energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. &#8220;The focus on power-efficient electronics is especially important now, because we are using so much energy to store information on remote servers that are running 24/7 and have to be kept cool,&#8221; Lederman said.</p>
<p>The new graduate program will benefit from UCSC&#8217;s close proximity to Silicon Valley and three Department of Energy National Laboratories (Lawrence Berkeley, SLAC, and Lawrence Livermore). UC Santa Cruz has already developed a strong research program through the <a href="https://mse.ucsc.edu/">Materials Science and Engineering Initiative</a>, and several departments offer materials-related courses.</p>
<p>The program spans three departments&#8212;Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Electrical and Computer Engineering&#8212;and will also include faculty from Earth and Planetary Sciences, Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, and Biomolecular Engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly interdisciplinary programs like this should be a hallmark of the campus,&#8221; said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident that this one, which so directly addresses emerging societal needs, will attract graduate students who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be here and who want to make a difference by doing extremely interesting and rewarding research.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="781f4988807270464370ac8c42354cd2"><name>rahul-gandhi-siliconvalleycenter-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Rahul Gandhi, India’s most influential opposition leader, addresses the future of democracy in India during his UCSC Silicon Valley Extension talk </title><summary>Rahul Gandhi highlighted the dysfunction and corruption of the current Indian government, alongside his party’s optimism for a more just future for India, during a surprise visit to University of California, Santa Cruz’s Silicon Valley Extension campus in Santa Clara this week.&#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rahul Gandhi, former president of the Indian National Congress, and India&#8217;s best-known opposition leader, highlighted the dysfunction and corruption of the current Indian government, alongside his party&#8217;s optimism for a democratic and more just future for India. Gandhi spoke during a surprise visit to University of California, Santa Cruz&#8217;s Silicon Valley Extension campus in Santa Clara this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandhi said Indian democracy and free expression sustained a massive blow in 2014, a pointed reference to the election in which prime minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged victorious.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modi&#8217;s political opponents, as well as organizations such as Human Rights Watch, have accused Modi&#8217;s government of targeting religious minorities, muzzling and prosecuting journalists, and using the tools of the state to punish political opponents.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contemporary India, &#8220;there is a confusion these days about power and force,&#8221; said Gandhi, whose grandmother, the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated in 1984. His father, Rajiv Gandhi, served as Indian prime minister from 1984 until his assassination in 1991. &#8220;Power and force are completely different things yet somehow everyone is convinced they are the same thing,&#8221; Gandhi said. &#8220;Power is the language of truth. You can throw as much force against that as you want, and nothing is going to happen &#8230;. Force is directed against somebody, and it is designed to suppress.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we were finding back home (in India) was that the rules that were available to us in politics some years ago were no longer available to us,&#8221; Gandhi said. &#8220;People think politics is just about politicians talking, but there is a whole infrastructure that supports the politics&#8212;the police, the judiciary, the idea that people can express themselves. It is clear that those were under pressure, that they were under attack.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All the instruments we needed to do politics in India were controlled by the BJP and the RSS (an Indian Hindu-nationalist paramilitary group),&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The talk, &#8220;Rahul Gandhi: Towards Justice and Democratic Futures,&#8221; was hosted by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://csas.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center For South Asian Studies (CSAS).</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandhi, in his on-stage discussion with UCSC professor of feminist studies Anjali Arondekar, founding co-director for the Center For South Asian Studies, emphasized the limits of BJP&#8217;s brand of politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For one minute I don&#8217;t believe the BJP cannot be defeated,&#8221; said Gandhi, who addressed the crowd while members of his security detail stood close by. &#8220;I, as a political actor, can see their huge vulnerability. The central weakness of the BJP is the tremendous amount of inequality and pain they are causing. It&#8217;s across the board. It is minorities, it is poor people, it is small to medium businesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arondekar said that the talk with Gandhi reflects the Center For South Asian Studies&#8217;s commitment to dialogues between members of the community and UC Santa Cruz scholars doing important public-facing research on issues of equity, inclusion, and human rights. &#8220;We believe in creating dialogue and sanctuary, and that is why our center is focused on questions of justice,&#8221; Arondekar said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The (speaking) invitation that Mr. Gandhi so generously accepted extends our vision of justice,&#8217;&#8217; Arondekar said. &#8220;It is a unique opportunity to come together and talk about the perils and possibilities of democratic futures in an increasingly divided and authoritarian India.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandhi, who received an enthusiastic response from the Santa Clara audience, spoke about the aftermath of his ejection from Parliament and the threats of arrest that have been made against him, as well as a momentous walk from the southernmost tip of India to the city of Srinagar, a journey of 621 miles (1,000 kilometers.)&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In taking this epic walk, the Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi set out to demonstrate, in a highly public way, that the authentic values of the Indian people, and in particular its poor and disenfranchised populations, have been distorted almost beyond recognition by slanted media coverage as well as entrenched political infrastructure, he told the Santa Clara crowd.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Words didn&#8217;t count for much, because &#8230; no matter what you tried to say, it would be reshaped, portrayed in a completely different way,&#8221; Gandhi said. &#8220;And the simple answer to this is to walk. It may sound strange, but it was unbelievably profound, because the moment we started to walk, we discovered a completely different India. To me, it was a massive shock.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The strangest thing I found is that in the 21st century now, people are really looking for action, affection, and togetherness, and the impression that one is given is the exact opposite,&#8221; Gandhi added.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point, Arondekar asked Gandhi how he was able to deal with the cold while wearing a flimsy shirt and avoiding jackets during the length of his walk. He explained that this was a conscious choice. He met with a group of children who were shivering because they did not have enough clothes on. He and his staff bought jackets for the children, but he decided not to wear them himself. &#8220;If kids can be in this cold without clothes, and I am stating that I will try to represent them, then on what basis do I wear a sweater?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the walk was intended as a physical demonstration of a core belief: &#8220;Most people think love is a feeling. Love is not a feeling. Love is an action that generates a feeling. So if you act lovingly, the opposition doesn&#8217;t have a choice.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early March, Gandhi was convicted of defamation because of a speech he made during the 2019 general election in which he compared Modi, his rival in the election, with two convicted criminals who also have the surname of Modi, a common surname in India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandhi was sentenced to two years in jail&#8212;the maximum sentence, as well as a penalty that resulted in his ejection from Parliament.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has been fighting to get the verdict overturned. Thus far, he has avoided jail time, but the threat still looms. Supporters of Modi have claimed the sentence was just, while his supporters call this a weaponization of the court system against Modi&#8217;s rival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of recent developments in Indian politics, Gandhi&#8217;s series of appearances in the U.S.A, offered reasons for hope, along with the recent &#8220;wave of euphoria&#8221; following the Indian opposition party&#8217;s triumph in the Karnataka state elections, said Arondekar. In Karnataka, home to 65 million people, the election results were a blow to Modi&#8217;s power and influence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arondekar noted that Gandhi&#8217;s Jodo Yatra had served as &#8220;an enormous source of inspiration&#8221; for many members of the Indian diaspora who were concerned about the precarity of democracy in India. &#8220;We have moved from a politics of disenchantment to engagement,&#8221; she said. However, Arondekar equally emphasized the contradictions in India&#8217;s political present, where electoral victory in Karnataka did not eliminate structural violence against Muslim populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the dialogue, Arondekar also pressed Gandhi on the escalation of sexual violence against women in India as well as the recent detention of some of India&#8217;s top female wrestlers after accusing the president of the Wrestling Foundation of India of sexual harassment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arondekar asked how Gandhi&#8217;s progressive vision might play out in electoral politics. Gandhi said that the Karnataka election is a good sign that those politics may be shifting.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pretty much all poor voters in Karnataka across the board voted for the Congress party, and one of the central elements we are dealing with in India is the massive difference between rich and poor&#8212;a few people who have almost unlimited wealth and millions and millions of people who are struggling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the talk, Anuradha Luther Maitra, a longtime UCSC Foundation trustee and former UC Santa Cruz professor who endowed a professorship for the Center For South Asian studies, asked Gandhi about the massive unemployment deficit in India. &#8220;By a reasonable estimate, that is about a hundred million jobs today,&#8221; she said. She also expressed profound concern about the education and health of the Indian people. &#8220;What would you do differently?&#8221; she asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandhi responded that unemployment in India is now a crisis that has spiraled out of control. &#8220;A huge reason for that unemployment has to do with the way the BJP is concentrating wealth and power and wiping out small businesses,&#8221; Gandhi said. &#8220;The central problem is that in India, we disrespect skills.&#8221; He spoke of the skilled jeans-makers in India who are now unemployed &#8220;because we are not linking capital with skills.&#8221; He also called for much greater public expenditure for education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even the way we teach and what we teach doesn&#8217;t make sense,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t let our children question. We make them memorize things. These, unfortunately, are cultural things. They hint at questions of caste and community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arondekar asked Gandhi what members of the Indian diaspora can do to support progressive politics in India, especially considering that the BJP enjoys wide support as well as financial backing of members of the diaspora in the U.S. and the UK. &#8220;We are with you with the love,&#8221; Arondekar asked. &#8220;Now give us an action plan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Express what India actually is,&#8221; Gandhi replied. &#8220;Express what our philosophy is, what our history is, because a lot of times what BJP does is completely distorting what India is. We prize humility first. All our great leaders in India tended towards humility. Where is the humility in the BJP? They know everything, they understand everything. I think the most important thing &#8230;is don&#8217;t respond to hatred with hatred. It drives them crazy. Don&#8217;t respond to their nastiness and cruelty with nastiness and cruelty. There will be no end to it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p>Belize hosts a population of around 1,000 manatees. With the growth of tourism in recent decades, however, Belize has seen a substantial increase in boat traffic, making boat strikes an increasingly important cause of manatee deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v51/p103-113/">published June 1 in <em>Endangered Species Research</em></a>, used 25 years of data on manatee strandings (dead or injured animals), six aerial surveys of the manatee population, and two decades of boat registration data to quantify the impacts of increasing boat traffic on the manatee population.</p>
<p>First author Celeshia Guy Galves, now at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute in Belize, led the study as a graduate student in the <a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu/">Coastal Science and Policy Program</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work has been shared with policymakers in Belize and will contribute directly to conservation planning, including protecting key areas for manatees such as the Belize River Mouth and the Placencia Lagoon,&#8221; Galves said.</p>
<p>Galves found that with more and more boats in the water, the number of manatee strandings caused by boat strikes has increased over time, from 1 to 4 per year in the late 1990s and early 2000s to 10 to 17 per year by the late 2010s. Strandings were more frequent in areas of high boat traffic, high human population density, and mangrove habitats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew that boat strikes were happening, but this study provides strong quantitative evidence of boat strikes as an increasing source of mortality for manatees in Belize, and it shows the areas where the risk is greatest,&#8221; said coauthor Marm Kilpatrick, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;These findings provide a basis for conservation measures that can be implemented to reduce the risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conservation efforts should focus on reducing the number of boats and their speed within zones of high manatee use, the authors said. High priorities for conservation interventions include creating more protected areas with restrictions on boat traffic, including areas designated for non-motorized boating or restricted access, as well as speed restrictions in shallow seagrass habitats.</p>
<p>Like the Florida manatee, the Antillean manatee is a subspecies of the West Indian manatee. In addition to boat strikes, threats to the Antillean manatee population include habitat degradation and loss, poaching, pollution, and entanglement in fishing gear.</p>
<p>Celeshia Galves and her husband, coauthor Jamal Galves, both work on manatee conservation at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute in Belize, and Jamal Galvez is a 2023 graduate of the UCSC Coastal Science and Policy Program. Other coauthors include Nicole Auil Gomez at the Wildlife Conservation Society in Belize; Don Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC; and Kelly Zilliacus, a research specialist in Croll&#8217;s Conservation Action Lab at UCSC.</p>

A team of astronomers discovered the giant helium tails escaping from the exoplanet HAT-P-32b using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at the University of Texas at Austin&#8217;s McDonald Observatory.</p>
<p>The helium tails&#8212;more than 50 times the length of the planet&#8217;s radius&#8212;are some of the longest tails of gas ever observed around a planet. The discovery is <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf8736">published June 7 in the journal <em>Science Advances</em></a>.</p>
<p>Tails of escaping material around planets are not unheard of. They can be the result of a collision freeing a trail of dust and debris. They can also be caused by the heat of a nearby star energizing and blowing a planet&#8217;s atmosphere into space. Tails as long as HAT-P-32b&#8217;s, however, are truly remarkable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is exciting to see how gigantic the extended tails are compared to the size of the planet and its host star,&#8221; said first author Zhoujian Zhang, a NASA Sagan fellow at UC Santa Cruz. He led the team that made this discovery while part of the UT Austin HET Exospheres Project. The HET Exospheres Project studies the atmospheres of planets outside of our solar system.</p>
<h2>Detecting the tails</h2>
<p>To learn about the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, astronomers can observe the parent star while the planet passes in front of it. This is what is referred to as a &#8220;transit.&#8221; One example would be when Venus passes between the Earth and Sun.</p>
<p>During a transit, the star shines light through the passing planet&#8217;s atmosphere (if there is one). Astronomers can study this light using spectroscopy to identify what elements are present in the atmosphere. With spectroscopy, the light is broken into a spectrum, much like white light shining through a prism. Different bands of color in the spectrum correspond to different elements.</p>
<p>Previous studies had detected HAT-P-32b&#8217;s tails. The tails&#8217; true sizes remained unknown, however, because astronomers had only observed the planet while it was passing in front of its star.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would not have seen this without the long-timeframe observations that we can get with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope,&#8221; said Caroline Morley, assistant professor at UT Austin and principal investigator for the HET Exospheres Project. &#8220;It allowed us to observe this planet for its full orbit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhang&#8217;s team observed HAT-P-32b over the course of several nights, capturing the moment when the planet crossed in front of the star as well as observations in the days before and after. This covered the full time it takes for the planet to orbit its star, ensuring the full extent of its tails was revealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The particularly interesting part of this work is that the escaping cloud of atmosphere is much larger than has ever been seen before, owing to a unique observational strategy. This suggests that all previous observations may have strongly underestimated the mass-loss from these planets, or that there is an unexpected, significant diversity in the mass-loss rates from this kind of planet,&#8221; said Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of the Other Worlds Laboratory at UCSC, who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>HAT-P-32b&#8217;s tails are likely caused by its parent star boiling off the planet&#8217;s atmosphere. The planet is what astronomers refer to as a &#8220;hot Jupiter,&#8221; meaning it is big, hot, gassy and has a close orbit around its star. Its orbit is so tight that the heat from its parent star is causing the gas in HAT-P-32b&#8217;s atmosphere to expand. The atmosphere has expanded so much that some of it has escaped the planet&#8217;s gravitational pull and been drawn into orbit around the nearby star.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings on HAT-P-32b may help us understand how other planets and their stars interact,&#8221; said Morley. &#8220;We are able to take high-precision measurements on hot Jupiters, like this one, and then apply our findings to a wider range of planets.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Hobby-Eberly Telescope</h2>
<p>The HET is particularly well suited to studying atmospheres on planets outside our solar system. Its high-resolution instrument, the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder spectrograph, is able to observe objects at near-infrared wavelengths. This includes the wavelength associated with helium, allowing astronomers to observe the gas escaping HAT-P-32b and other similar planets.</p>
<p>Another perk of observing with HET is that it surveys the same sweep of sky each night. Unlike most other telescopes, which tilt up and down, the HET's 10- by 11-meter mirror is always tilted at 55 degrees above the horizon. This can lead to high-precision, long-timeline observations of the same swath of sky each night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we can observe the system every night for several days in a row, we can detect physically large structures like this one,&#8221; said Zhang. &#8220;Other planets might also have extended escaping atmospheres waiting to be discovered through similar monitoring.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HET is a joint project of the University of Texas at Austin, the Pennsylvania State University, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet Muenchen, and Georg-August Universitaet Goettingen. The HET is named in honor of its principal benefactors, William P. Hobby and Robert E. Eberly.</p>
<p>The HET Exospheres Project is funded by the NASA Exoplanets Research Program. The HET Habitable-Zone Planet Finder team is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the NASA Astrobiology Institute, and the Heising-Simons Foundation.</p>

This new program celebrates the university&#8217;s talented faculty, researchers, staff, students, and community partners for their outstanding contributions to innovation and creativity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our university has a track record of research excellence, trail-blazing scholarship, exciting innovation and expansive creativity,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;These awards give us the opportunity to recognize the transformational work taking place across UC Santa Cruz that is impacting society for the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Managed by the <a href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu/">Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub</a>, the awards recognize transformational work across UC Santa Cruz &#8211; in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our faculty colleagues lead ground-breaking research, creative scholarship, artistic production and innovation,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;Through these endeavors, many of them multidisciplinary, we better understand our changing world and create knowledge, technologies and modes of expression that empower individuals and communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The award categories include Innovator of the Year, Lifetime Achievement in Innovation, and Community Changemaker. This year&#8217;s recipients are world leaders in tracking and mapping the COVID-19 virus and its variants in real time, creators of technology that is transforming how we understand our own human DNA, abolitionists working to change the narrative and understanding of society&#8217;s reliance on prisons and policing, and community partners supporting innovators and students, helping them connect with the local ecosystem and develop as entrepreneurs.</p>
<h2>Innovator of the Year</h2>
<p>This award recognizes faculty and associated project teams that may include staff and students for innovative or creative work that, during the past 12 months, has resulted in societal impact or has reached a milestone that positions the innovations and creativity for near-term societal impact. Recipients receive $10,000 to further advance their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Corbett-Detig - Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering</strong></p>
<p>Russell Corbett-Detig and his team (Angie Hinrichs - Bioinformatics Programmer, Genome Browser Team, UCSC; Yatish Turakhia - UC San Diego assistant professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and former Genomics Institute postdoctoral scholar; and Bryan Thornlow - former student working with Corbett-Detig) developed a tool called Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing tRees, commonly known as UShER, that quickly became fundamental in battling COVID-19.</p>
<p>The computational tool enables real-time SARS-CoV-2 tracking and helps researchers identify new lineages of the virus. The easy-to-use tool and online server creates an evolutionary tree that helps scientists understand genomic mutations by creating new branches on the tree, showing the relationships between virus samples and the order in which mutations happened along various lineages as the virus evolves. The result today is a phylogenetic tree of more than 14 million genomes and growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think UShER is going to be applied to tracking almost every major human pathogen,&#8221; Corbett-Detig said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re calling this new paradigm of phylogenetics is online phylogenetics. The idea is that you&#8217;re never stopping, you&#8217;re just always growing. It&#8217;s always online. You&#8217;re just growing it forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>UShER, a free tool, is now used worldwide by the majority of public health organizations to identify COVID-19 and its variants, as it is the default software behind <a href="https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin.html">Pangolin</a>, the ubiquitously used tool for assigning COVID-19 sequences to their most likely lineage. Corbett-Detig and his team are also expanding the software to enable analyses of other pathogens, including the recent spread of monkeypox and drug-resistant tuberculosis. UShER is fully-integrated into the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gina Dent - Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for the Humanities Division and Associate Professor of Feminist Studies</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rachel Nelson - Director and Chief Curator of the Institute of Arts and Sciences and teaches in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://ias.ucsc.edu/visualizing-abolition/">Visualizing Abolition</a> is the nation&#8217;s most ambitious and sustained art and prison abolition initiative. The project examines the ways people see and understand issues of mass incarceration, detention, and policing in the United States and abroad, challenging the prevailing social, economic, and political worldviews that prisons promote.</p>
<p>The initiative was developed by Dr. Gina Dent and Dr. Rachel Nelson, with support from the Mellon Foundation.</p>
<p>In collaboration with artists, scholars, poets, lawyers and activists, and through public exhibitions and educational genres, the initiative breaks through entrenched societal views of prisons and policing and challenges people to think about how we can take a reimagined approach to community safety and justice. Collaborators create a new collective story of a future free of prisons through art, music and culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need people from every discipline, from every walk of life to be a part of this thinking and we also have to be thinking about what the prison promises to do, that it&#8217;s failing to do and what we need to build instead,&#8221; said Dent. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to see that after many, many years, it&#8217;s possible to talk about these issues in the public in ways that make me think that we may make some real change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exhibitions such as Barring Freedom at the San Jos&#233; Museum of Art provide space for civic engagement with issues directly touching people&#8217;s lives and have found eager audiences. Despite taking place during the height of the pandemic, the attendance included an impressive number of first-time visitors to the museum. The related online Visualizing Abolition events were also attended in record numbers, with over 30,000 viewers in just the first two months of the series.</p>
<p>The initiative also supports public events, postdoctoral fellowships, a faculty working group, and curriculum development that reaches across prison borders.</p>

<h2>Lifetime Achievement in Innovation</h2>
<p>The Lifetime Achievement in Innovation award recognizes a faculty member whose career accomplishments include innovations or creativity that have led to significant, long-term societal impact and who is an inspiration and positive influence for students and colleagues. The recipient receives an award of $5,000 to direct to a division, department, or lab of their choosing to support innovative research activities.</p>
<p>David Deamer and Mark Akeson, Research Professors Emeriti of Biomolecular Engineering, are the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/nanopore-feature.html">co-inventors of nanopore sequencing</a>, a revolutionary method of reading DNA and RNA. The nanopore technology they pioneered together is transformational to how we understand our own human DNA.</p>
<p>David Deamer came to UC Santa Cruz in 1994 from UC Davis where his research focused on creating artificial cells. In this, he was pondering questions of how to pull molecules through membranes, which are nearly impermeable. One day, while on a drive, thinking through these questions led him to come up with an amazing idea.</p>
<p>He realized that when pulling a string of DNA through a tiny hole with an electric current running, each of the bases would have a slightly different effect on the current, which could be distinguished and translated to read out the bases. The result was a revolutionary method of reading DNA and RNA. The name nanopore references the size of the pore, which would end up being just two nanometers across.</p>
<p>Mark Akeson was a graduate student at UC Davis studying soil microbiology when he met Deamer. Akeson joined the nanopore work group at UCSC, led by Deamer, after spending several years as a research scientist at the NIH. His work focused on the molecular biology processes that would enable the technology, and he was tasked to set up the original nanopore device in their Baskin School of Engineering lab.</p>
<p>In a paper published in 1999, the group proved that segments of bases could be distinguished from each other as they impeded the ionic current through the nanometer-sized pore, providing evidence that Deamer&#8217;s conceptual idea was achievable.</p>
<p>Akeson discovered the first enzyme, a polymerase, that could latch on to the DNA strand and regulate its processive movement through the nanopore, a crucial step in making the new technology a usable product.</p>
<p>Deamer&#8217;s and Akeson&#8217;s ideas were licensed to Oxford Nanopore Technologies in 2009 as patents, eventually leading to the company&#8217;s revolutionary MinION. This small, portable device uses nanopores to read DNA and RNA at a fraction of the cost of the state-of-the-art competitors, making sequencing accessible for scientists worldwide. Since the original release in 2014, continual improvements implemented by Oxford Nanopore have increased the MinION&#8217;s accuracy from about 74 percent to 99+ percent, and new models have the power of 500 MinIONs. These licenses have become the most lucrative invention out of UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations to Professors Dave Deamer and Mark Akeson for this well-deserved lifetime achievement award,&#8221; Gordon Sanghera, CEO of Oxford Nanopore Technologies said. "Their foundational ideas and tireless scientific drive paved the way for an entirely novel way to sequence DNA and RNA. They made it possible for Oxford Nanopore to disrupt the sequencing world with the most accessible technology that is delivering comprehensive biological insights to the scientific community. Nanopore sequencing has had a profound impact on scientific research worldwide, and we are just at the start of the genomics era, which stands to open up huge research potential in human health and disease, conservation and many other areas facing our planet "</p>
<p>Nanopore technology has enabled some of the most significant advances in genomics, including the sequencing of many COVID-19 genomes worldwide. It was vital to completing the first-ever gapless sequence of a human genome, a project led by UCSC&#8217;s Karen Miga and the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium. It allowed them to do long reads, decoding the millions of repeated bases in the human genome, which is impossible with other sequencing techniques.</p>
<p>Today, Deamer is using nanopore sequencing in his ongoing research into how life began on Earth four billion years ago. Traveling to volcanoes around the world, he is studying how wet/dry cycles around the hot springs might have created the conditions in which nucleic acids originally came to exist. And, the technology is being used beyond Earth. A MiniON was taken to the international Space Station to sequence organisms that may threaten astronaut&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>In collaboration with scientists in UCSC&#8217;s world-renowned Center for the Biology of RNA, Akeson is using nanopore sequencing to explore &#8216;RNA Dark Matter&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Community Changemaker</h2>
<p>The Community Changemaker award recognizes a leader or organization in the Santa Cruz region that has contributed significantly to driving regional economic prosperity through innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, or support for growing the innovation ecosystem in close collaboration with the university.</p>
<p>Doug Erickson, executive director of <a href="https://www.santacruzworks.org/">Santa Cruz Works</a> (SCW), is a valued ally and community partner with UC Santa Cruz. Erickson is personally and professionally committed to increasing the awareness of campus research and innovation and the impact it has locally, across the state and around the world.</p>
<p>During the height of the pandemic, Erickson expanded Santa Cruz Work&#8217;s digital presence, hosting several public, free webinars about UCSC researchers working on COVID testing, genomics contact-tracing and sequencing, as well as public education series on COVID, viruses, and the mRNA vaccine from UCSC virologists. He also connected companies making PPE with the university, and many of them donated thousands of dollars in PPE for our employees working on campus.</p>
<p>Erickson is dedicated to supporting innovators and students, helping them develop as entrepreneurs by identifying resources and funding opportunities, and facilitating employment possibilities. He was instrumental in establishing CruzHacks, the largest hackathon in Santa Cruz where students develop solutions to real-work problems.</p>
<p>Erickson also supported campus startups through Santa Cruz Work&#8217;s accelerator. More than half of the first cohort were UCSC startups. Now in its fifth cohort, the program has supported more than 50 companies in starting their businesses in Santa Cruz, many from UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>He played a leading role in bringing Launchpad '22 to campus and the SCW was a key organizer and convenor of Blue Innovation '22 aimed at supporting and broadening the local and global networks for research, businesses, and other community stakeholders focused on water management and ocean climate solutions.</p>

The exhibition is curated by Professor Gina Dent, Dr. Rachel Nelson, and Luke A. Fidler. <br/><br/>At the core of the exhibition is <em>The Teachings of the Hands</em>, a single-channel film that depicts complex histories of colonization, migration, and ecological precarity in &#8220;Somi Se&#8217;k,&#8221; the &#8220;Land of the Sun&#8221; (also known as Texas). Told from the perspective of Juan Mancias, Chairman of the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe, the film weaves scenes from the present day together with the distant past in order to explore issues of environmental justice and Indigenous rights and cosmologies. Creatively mapping the impacts of industry, infrastructure, and private property in Texas, the larger exhibition expands upon the themes within the film, and includes drawings, collages, original 1930s watercolors by artists and amateur archaeologists Forrest and Lula Kirkland, as well as an immersive installation of surveying tools. A new sculptural installation maps the histories of the Monterey Bay region by tracking the ways in which land has been divided according to agricultural, urban and carceral systems.<br/><br/><em>Sadie Barnette: Family Business</em>, a multi-sited exhibition organized with the San Jos&#233; Museum of Art (SJMA), explores the artist&#8217;s family history to reveal the personal&#8212;and shared&#8212;experience of Black repression and resistance in the United States. It is curated by Professor Gina Dent, Dr. Rachel Nelson, and Lauren Schell Dickens, SJMA chief curator. <br/><br/>At the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, the exhibition centers on Barnette&#8217;s <em>FBI Drawings</em>, a series of works drawn from the 500-page FBI surveillance file amassed on the artist&#8217;s father, Rodney Barnette, founder of the Compton, California chapter of the Black Panther Party. Barnette creates monumental and painstaking graphite drawings of these clinical documents, covering them with roses and Hello Kitty profiles, effectively smothering records of state-sanctioned terror with Black power and joy. A new wallpaper installation expands on these themes.<br/><br/>&#8220;From Caycedo and de Rozas powerful work, which extends our perception of incarceration to consider how landscapes and bodies of water have also been caught into systems of capture, to Sadie Barnette&#8217;s work about her family history as it relates to collective stories of struggle and liberation, these are powerful artworks,&#8221; explains Professor Gina Dent, co-director of Visualizing Abolition. &#8220;We hope they challenge people to think about the consequences of how we have normalized carcerality&#8211;&#8211;and to begin to think of other ways we could organize society.&#8221;<br/> <br/>At SJMA, Barnette has created an intimate installation around a newly commissioned video. Amid a fantasy domestic setting, complete with a sofa covered in glitter vinyl, walls papered with repeating patterns, and glowing pink lights, the newly commissioned video draws on her existing strategies of archival manipulation by combining manipulated family footage with a propulsive drum score. The installation materializes and proposes an alternate history of Black America outside of state control, a history made from flourishing relationships, love, family, celebration, and hope; the very things omitted from official documents of surveillance and repression. <br/> <br/><em>Carolina Caycedo and David de Rozas: The Blessings of the Mystery</em> and <em>Sadie Barnette: Family Business</em> are part of the major public scholarship program, Visualizing Abolition, an ongoing initiative exploring art, prisons, and justice. Visualizing Abolition highlights the creative work underway by artists, activists, and scholars to imagine alternatives to current injustices. Visualizing Abolition is organized by UCSC Professor Gina Dent and Dr. Rachel Nelson, director of IAS, in partnership with Lauren Schell Dickens, SJMA chief curator.<br/><br/>The new commissions and exhibitions enliven the conversations central to Visualizing Abolition about prisons, their histories, and their impacts. Both exhibitions will open at IAS on April 28, 2023, and following an opening reception on May 5, 2023 they will remain on view until September 3, 2023. The SJMA exhibition is on view from March 10, 2023 through October 15, 2023.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Serena Campbell (Merrill &#8217;23, sociology, critical race and ethnic studies) arrived at UCSC, it transformed her environmental worldview. Now, Campbell is working towards transforming UCSC&#8217;s own environmental research and pedagogy through her work with the Building Belonging Program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell began her time at UCSC as a double-major in environmental studies and sociology. However, a class within&#160; the History of Art and Visual Culture Department injected Campbell&#8217;s approach to environmentalism with intersectional concepts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I came here, I didn't know about critical approaches to environmentalism: I only knew about the mainstream,&#8221; said Campbell. &#8220;When I took the course </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate Justice Now</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it opened up my eyes to there being other approaches to environmentalism that center the experiences and the expertise of people of color, and actually work towards addressing climate issues and naming structural causes of these issues.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/funding/building-belonging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Belonging Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is part of UCSC&#8217;s </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Social Transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which supports&#160; research projects, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying Critical Environmental Work and Needs on Campus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managed by Professors Flora Lu, Emily Murai and Professor Hillary Angelo. The Institute for Social Transformation&#8217;s Director of Operations, Evin Knight, is proud of the work Campbell has been able to achieve through the program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Serena and her work are stellar examples of the change we hope to achieve through the Institute for Social Transformation,&#8221; Knight said. &#8220;The Building Belonging Program provides undergraduate students with the unique opportunity to participate in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">faculty mentored service-learning and research projects. In Serena&#8217;s case, she took her project and propelled it into something transformative.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Building Belonging Program launched in 2020, the institute has awarded over 340 student scholarships&#8211;totalling more than $500,000 going directly to students&#8211;supporting over 130 faculty research projects.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Cultivating a Critical Environmentalism Network</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Building Belonging Program inspired</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell to switch to a double major in sociology and critical race and ethnic studies, where she learned&#160; more about critical approaches to environmentalism. Campbell interviewed 58 faculty and staff across campus on their research, and compiled her findings into a research project, with the goals of making a network between researchers. On the advice of Professor Hillary Angelo, Campbell transformed her research into a senior thesis entitled &#8220;&#8216;The university needs to listen: Moving from Mainstream to Critical Environmentalism at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through her interdivisional research and interviewing, Campbell came to an impactful conclusion:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's definitely a lot of faculty on campus who have interest in doing critical environmental work as I found through the research I conducted, but there isn't a lot of institutional support for this work to be done,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What happens now is that there are so many faculty and staff who are interested in critical environmentalisms, but because of departmental silos or physical boundaries across campus, it's hard to meet these people and form these collaborations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a semester of research, Campbell found a dire need for collaboration across departments and fields of study: UCSC has multiple professors and researchers focusing on the same subject of critical environmentalisms, but often working in academic isolation. Campbell, in her research, even discovered professors working on duplicate projects without being aware of each other's efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this discovery, Campbell saw a clear problem and came ready with a corresponding solution from her research: a comprehensive critical environmentalism network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network is a place where students, staff, faculty, and community members can access this information. They can find out what's happening on campus, and what people are working on. The network can provide connection for the otherwise dispersed critical environmental research at UCSC, and Campbell hopes it brings researchers together across environmental disciplines.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The network encourages interdisciplinary collaboration, because right now a lot of funding goes towards the hard sciences as opposed to social sciences or arts, which aren't considered as important within environmental issues,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;But their views are important: they inspire and lead towards activism, which is the way to create change for these environmental issues.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell&#8217;s </span><a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/engage/academic-opportunities/crit.-environm.-facutly-staff-list.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is accessible now on the </span><a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/engage/academic-opportunities/critical-environmentalisms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainability Office website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is open to all. The project contains a comprehensive listing of both faculty involved in critical environmentalism, as well as Critical Environmentalist campus initiatives, organizations, and centers and relevant courses to Critical Environmentalisms. From this network, Campbell hopes to expand into an eventual physical space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;Hopefully, this network leads towards a cluster or center for critical environmentalism on campus. There would be socializing events, which people indicated as a need.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell knows the importance of such connections firsthand&#8212;it&#8217;s what led her to the Building Belonging Program, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Building Belonging Project really opened my eyes to research opportunities on campus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was able to learn about so many more opportunities for involvement on campus related to critical approaches to environmentalism, and learn about more courses by interviewing the faculty and staff members.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through resources like the&#160; critical environmentalism network, Campbell hopes that students will expand their studies beyond the classroom, and look towards research opportunities and new courses to expand their mindset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's all these opportunities that connected me to faculty and staff on campus, which opened my eyes to how much more there is to pursue at UCSC,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You can really diversify your educational experiences by doing more on campus than just classes.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/serenacampbelllead-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/serenacampbelllead-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>serenacampbelllead-featured.jpg</name><file-size>40445</file-size><width>678</width><height>278</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Serena Campbell</thumb-alt><title>Serena Campbell: A network for the future</title><description>Graduating senior Serena Campbell constructed a vital network to unite UCSC’s critical environmentalism research across departments and disciplines.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9308c905807270467f2f87827f61b0d9"><name>2023-soc-sci-student-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Annual awards recognize outstanding students in the Social Sciences Division</title><summary>The Division of Social Sciences’ annual Student Awards Luncheon was held on June 2 at College Nine’s Namaste Lounge.</summary><start-date>1686034800000</start-date><path>/2023/06/2023-soc-sci-student-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/06/2023-soc-sci-student-awards</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1686094006508</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1686094325515</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Division of Social Sciences</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/safi-award.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/safi-award.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>safi-award.jpg</name><display-name>safi-award.jpg</display-name><file-size>71010</file-size><width>250</width><height>295</height></image><image-alt>Photo of student with award plaque with faculty members</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/safi-award-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/safi-award-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>safi-award-80.jpg</name><display-name>safi-award-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>25032</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of student with award plaque with faculty members</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Amanda Safi, center, receives the&#160;Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship from Acting Dean Heather Bullock (right) and Politics Professor Daniel Wirls (left).

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/zimmerman/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scholarship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was established to honor UC Santa Cruz graduate Gabriel "Gabe" Zimmerman, who was shot and killed in the 2011 attack on U.S. Congressperson Gabrielle Giffords. Zimmerman served as Giffords' Community Outreach Director and they were together at a constituent-engagement event when gunshots rang out. He ran toward Giffords, who was gravely wounded in the assassination attempt. Gabe was killed. The scholarship was established in the weeks after the shooting by UC Santa Cruz graduates Jonathan Klein (Merrill '89, politics) and Alex Clemens (Porter '89, international politics) and has since attracted support from more than 520 donors. It supports undergraduates who are passionate about social issues and committed to social service.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Around 100&#160; UC Santa Cruz staff and faculty retire each year. </i><a href="https://rec.ucsc.edu/events/retiring-class-2023.html"><i>Please join us in celebrating </i></a><i>the next chapter of their lives. </i><i>If you or someone you know is retiring and would like to be included on the Welcome to Retirement page </i><i>information can be submitted to the Retiree &amp; Emeriti Center at rec@ucsc.edu.</i></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an illustrious academic career spanning decades, Professor David Brundage has cultivated an extraordinary legacy at UC Santa Cruz and touched thousands of students&#8217; lives and minds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 38 years of interdisciplinary teaching and research at UCSC, Brundage is retiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a student walks out of one of his classes, he hopes they leave with a critical awareness of the deep inequalities within American society in terms of class, race, gender, and ethnicity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to know how to think critically but also how to make positive social change while facing the grave inequalities in American life,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I hope they learn something about the importance of history, the importance of knowing the history of popular movements like the civil rights movement, and knowing that history is a resource for making positive change in the present.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of students have gone in and out of the doors of Brundage&#8217;s classes, and many of them leave with a new perspective on history and how to make positive social change. Over the years, he has received notes from multiple alumni, many of whom have gone on to teach social studies, run nonprofits, lead labor organizing drives, join political campaigns, and remember Brundage&#8217;s teachings.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Students would write to me out of the blue years later saying they remembered my courses,&#8221; he says. &#8220;One is a high school teacher, one is a city planner, and one worked for Obama in 2008. She said she had remembered what I taught her about six years earlier on race and American politics. It&#8217;s super rewarding to look back on all of the wonderful students I&#8217;ve had over the years.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brundage won the UCSC Social Sciences &#8220;Golden Apple&#8221; Outstanding Teaching Award in 1997 and served as a mentor in Merrill College&#8217;s Undergraduate Research Mentorship Program in 2013-14 and 2019-20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brundage began his career at UCSC in 1985 when the campus was still the newest in the UC system and was known for its small class sizes and unique collaboration between faculty and students. In fact, one of the very first classes he taught consisted of ten students with two faculty members.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like there are two parts to my career here. One was very undergrad focused and was in very small settings. And then in the last 10-11 years, there have been bigger classes, but more work with graduate students, and I have really enjoyed that as well.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of his recent doctoral students have published important historical monographs of their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brundage primarily taught Community Studies courses until 2011, then moved to the History Department, where he carried out the rest of his tenure.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His research centers on the intersection of labor and immigration history, focusing particularly on the Irish in America. He is the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Making of Western Labor Radicalism: Denver&#8217;s Organized Workers. 1878-1905</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a co-author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who Built America? Working People &amp; the Nation&#8217;s Economy, Politics, Culture &amp; Society</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His latest book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irish Nationalists in America: The Politics of Exile, 1798-1998</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (published by Oxford University Press in 2016), explores the long history of transnational political activism among the Irish in the United States. Both of his sole-authored books were selected as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choice Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Outstanding Academic Titles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A highlight of his career was serving in the Academic Senate. Brundage started Academic Senate service very early in his career, pre-tenure; he served as the Chair of the UCSC Academic Senate from 2020-22.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I took seriously the notion that in the UC system, we have shared governance, especially around curriculum and teaching,&#8221; Brundage said. &#8220;The Academic Senate is the voice of the faculty, and in these areas especially, the faculty is listened to. And so, I was always involved in the Senate, and joining leadership and serving as Senate Chair at a difficult moment for our campus was extremely gratifying.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before arriving at UC Santa Cruz, Brundage earned his BA from Reed College, his M.A. from the University of Warwick, and a Ph.D. from UCLA.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brundage is excited to head into retirement and focus on his research, perhaps at a somewhat slower pace.&#160;</span></p>

Machine learning techniques implemented by the team allowed the bots to continuously learn from their environment and improve their performance. Next-generation personal assistant bots stand to be especially impactful for older adults and people living with disabilities.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;The skills and technologies developed for the SimBot Challenge have real-world applications,&#8221; said Jing Gu, a Ph.D. student and leader of team SlugJARVIS. &#8220;Our team's success could lead to opportunities in the fields of home automation, robotics, and AI. Participating in the challenge and reaching the finals is a valuable learning experience.&#8221;<br/><br/>The UCSC team, called SlugJARVIS, is advised by Assistant Professor of CSE Xin (Eric) Wang and includes seven CSE Ph.D. students who all study in Wang&#8217;s <a href="http://eric-lab.soe.ucsc.edu/home">ERIC</a> lab. The project aligns with areas of research exploration in Wang&#8217;s lab &#8211; embodied artificial intelligence (robots operating in 3D environments), natural language processing, and computer vision.<br/><br/>&#8220;The SimBot Challenge began concurrently with the arrival of our lab's first group of students. They have done an incredibly outstanding job in research, and securing the top 3 position in the finals marked an important milestone in our embodied AI journey. However, we view this achievement as just the beginning, with our sights firmly set on a future ambition: to bring embodied agents into reality across diverse applications such as robotics, smart home assistants, and beyond.&#8221;<br/><br/>The SlugJarvis team began working on this project in January 2022, and later <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/2022-alexa-prize.html">won the public benchmark phase</a> of the challenge. In April 2023, the team advanced to the finalist round, where they competed to make their bot best respond to commands and multimodal sensor inputs from within a virtual world.<br/><br/>Amazon Alexa customers interacted with the finalists&#8217; SimBots by saying "Alexa, play with robot" on Echo Show or Fire TV devices. They then had the option to leave ratings and feedback, which played into the final rankings and helped the student teams improve their bots.&#160;<br/><br/>The UCSC team was awarded a $50,000 prize for their third-place finish.

CCI provides campus leadership with a comprehensive program to foster a campus climate in which Jewish students feel comfortable expressing their identity free of antisemitism, harassment, or marginalization.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is the second UC campus to join the initiative and the fourth university in California. Over the next 16 months, campus leaders will receive training and resources and will work closely with Santa Cruz Hillel leaders and the Campus Climate Initiative team.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sharp rise in antisemitism across the nation is deeply troubling, and we must work to counter those who perpetuate hate in an effort to divide us,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;We are looking forward to partnering with Hillel leaders to strengthen the UC Santa Cruz experience for Jewish students.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/us-antisemitic-incidents-hit-highest-level-ever-recorded-adl-audit-finds">reported that the number of antisemitic incidents</a> increased by 36 percent in 2022, reaching an all-time high in the United States. Antisemitic activity reported on college and university campuses increased by 41 percent in 2022, with 219 incidents reported at more than 130 campuses across the country.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz community was stunned and horrified by antisemitic and anti-LGBTQIA+ incidents that occurred in April. Campus leaders have been providing support and resources to the students impacted, while also seeking opportunities to strengthen the campus climate. Participating in this initiative is an important step toward strengthening the campus climate for Jewish students and strengthening inclusivity overall. Additional efforts are underway and will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Hillel International created CCI in 2020 to collaborate with higher education leaders. The initiative recognizes that senior leaders serve an important role in bringing about broad-based changes on campus and that university-Hillel collaborations can benefit all students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jewish students should feel comfortable expressing their identity, culture, and values,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;We are looking forward to working with Hillel and the CCI team to combat antisemitism on our campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>CCI&#8217;s program intentionally integrates into the host campus&#8217;s broader diversity, equity and inclusion efforts to foster a positive campus climate for all students. The program provides campuses with formal research tools to assess their current climate and a 16-month educational curriculum for senior leaders through which to explore Jewish student experiences on campus. It also supports the development and implementation of action plans that seek to create a more inclusive climate for Jewish students and all students.</p>
<p>In order to proactively counter antisemitism before an incident occurs, CCI works with university leaders to better understand the atmosphere on their campuses and take specific positive steps that enable Jewish students and all students to thrive. The 16-month cohort experience, comprising about a dozen universities each year, facilitates learning and sharing among hundreds of university administrators mutually committed to addressing campus antisemitism and creating relationships with their local Hillel campus professionals that improve coordination when antisemitic incidents do occur. The Hillel team will serve as a partner for campus administration toward the shared goal of a safe, vibrant campus community for Jewish students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b4ffd651807270463b04fd9908e60a2f"><name>watsonville-parade</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Employees invited to volunteer for Watsonville July 4 Parade</title><summary>&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audries Blake, associate director of community relations, is spearheading efforts to increase the university&#8217;s engagement countywide, with a particular focus on South County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a great place for UC Santa Cruz to celebrate the city&#8217;s time-treasured parade with the community, where thousands of people from around the city, and the region gather. I believe walking in the parade will allow people to see us, and learn that we are there to celebrate them, and the broader community,&#8221; says Blake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus employees&#8212;faculty, administrators, and staff and their families&#8212;are invited to volunteer by walking as a group in the parade. It&#8217;s expected that participants will meet in Watsonville at 12pm, and walk an .8 mile route, waving to people lining the parade route. </span><a href="https://forms.gle/fV3rNfss4fP1v2Na6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to join the fun!&#160;</span></p>

Every employee at the University plays a role in maintaining our ethical standards. The University&#8217;s Whistleblower Policy provides multiple avenues for employees to bring forward concerns of potential employee misconduct. The University encourages faculty and staff to report concerns about possible improper governmental activity directly to their supervisor, department head, Locally Designated Official (LDO) or other appropriate university offices or officials, or to make reports through the <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline">whistleblower hotline</a> (800-403-4744).</p>
<p>The systemwide whistleblower hotline is independently-operated to receive calls or web-based reporting from faculty, staff, students or members of the public. The hotline allows for anonymous reporting, forwarding reported concerns to appropriate University officials for processing. This hotline is staffed seven days a week, 24 hours per day and is capable of receiving reports in a number of different languages.</p>
<p>For more information about the whistleblower process, please visit the <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/hotline">UC Whistleblower website</a> and keep an eye out for posters displayed in various employee areas that outline reporting channels. Additionally, the University's whistleblower poster highlights other avenues for reporting improper governmental activity, such as the California State Auditor and the California Attorney General.</p>
<p>The California Government Code requires every state agency, including the University of California, to annually distribute to its employees a message from the California State Auditor that provides an explanation of the California Whistleblower Protection Act.

Time-lapse microscopy allows scientists to detect and track cells, but produces huge amounts of data that is nearly impossible to sort through manually.<br/><br/>Now, however, powerful data processing capabilities of modern deep learning models offer techniques to sort through so much imaging data. Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Ali Shariati and doctoral student Abolfazl Zarageri together with several student researchers in the Shariati lab have developed and released a new deep learning model called &#8220;DeepSea,&#8221; one of the only tools with the ability to segment cells, track them and detect their division to follow lineages of cells. DeepSea, which is detailed in a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(23)00129-7">new paper</a> in <em>Cell Reports Methods</em>, is one of the highest-accuracy tools of its kind.&#160;<br/><br/>DeepSea&#8217;s model training dataset, user-friendly software, and open source code is <a href="https://deepseas.org/">available for use on the DeepSea website</a>, and Shariati and his team of researchers have already used it to make new discoveries about stem cell growth and division.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;The model is more efficient, has fewer parameters, and both segmentation and tracking are integrated into a user-friendly software,&#8221; Shariati said. &#8220;The software allows you to train the model for any cell type of interest, paving the way for future discoveries.&#8221;<br/><br/>Time-lapse microscopy, which captures a series of images from a microscope over time, allows researchers to monitor single cells over the course of an experiment to track phenomena such as differentiation &#8212; when stem cells become a specific type of cell &#8212; or change in shape and size over time. This can allow scientists to make new biological discoveries by measuring dynamics of cell biological phenomena at single cell level.<br/><br/>Once the scientists have gathered images, they need to carry out two main tasks: segmentation, or identifying the borders of individual cells from each other and the background; and tracking, or following a cell from one frame to the next. From that point, the researchers can further investigate characteristics such as size, shape, texture, how they move and change their shape, and more.&#160;<br/><br/>Manually sorting through microscopy images is tedious, time consuming, and ultimately a task better suited for a computer &#8212; which is where DeepSea comes in. This efficient deep learning model can perform segmentation in less than a second, and track cells with 98 percent accuracy.&#160;<br/><br/>Enabling the software to detect cell division was a particularly unique and challenging aspect of this project, as there are few if any other situations in which artificial intelligence and computer vision must track one object transforming into two.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This is a very unusual problem for object tracking,&#8221; Shariati said. &#8220;If you want to track a car or something, the car will be moving around and you can use machine learning and computer vision to follow them as they move. But for cells all of a sudden one object becomes two, and that's a fundamentally new problem that we needed to solve, and we were able to do so.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>DeepSea is a generalizable model, meaning it can be used to track a variety of cell types. It uses a modified version of a popular model, 2D-UNET, with significantly less parameters to achieve both fast speeds and high accuracy.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We compared our model with some of the best cell segmentation models, and ours is now showing the best results in terms of precision, and speed, especially for these cell types,&#8221; said Zarageri, an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in Shariati&#8217;s lab who led the creation of the software.<br/><br/>The researchers trained DeepSea using a dataset of images of cells manually segmented from their backgrounds, a time-intensive process as the images are often low-contrast and the cell bodies hard to make out. To aid in this process, the team developed another software tool to help crop, label, and edit the microscopy images of cells, which is also available at <a href="http://Deepseas.org">DeepSeas.org</a>.<br/><br/>The training dataset included images of lung, muscle, and stem cells, meaning DeepSea achieves high precision across different cell types. More cell types can be added into future versions of the model.&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers used DeepSea to study size regulation of embryonic stem cells, which are the foundation of multicellular life and can differentiate into every other cell type. They came away with the new discovery that embryonic stem cells, which are known to divide unusually fast, regulate their size so that smaller cells spend a longer time growing before producing the next generation of cells.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We found that if an embryonic stem cell is born small, they kind of know that they are small, so they spend more time growing before they go on and divide again,&#8221; Shariati said. &#8220;We do not know why and how exactly this happens, but at least that phenomenon is there.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>In the future, the researchers plan to apply their existing software to gather data to study spatial relationships between cells, and how the cellular features are organized in 3-D patterns to form structures.&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers also aim to resolve bottlenecks they have noticed in using their deep learning models, such as the lack of labeled images of cells that are used to train the models. They plan to use a class of machine learning frameworks called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create new synthetic data, images of cells that are already annotated to cut down on the time it takes to create labels. The researchers would then have large libraries of datasets of any cell type of interest with minimal human involvement.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bc293700807270461029c9b0eeea4243"><name>foodways-dinner</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Foodways benefit dinner advances food security at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>Alumni, donors, and friends of UC Santa Cruz gathered at the Hay Barn on June 2 to raise funds for Basic Needs programs at the university. &#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As alumni, donors, and friends of UC Santa Cruz entered the Hay Barn, with its rich warm wood accents and natural afternoon light, the sounds of music from local live performers on the patio flowed in through the back doors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building, an original part of the Cowell Lime Works Historic District, was restored a few years ago and now serves as the headquarters of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Agroecology&#8212;a key partner in expanding basic needs access to the 19,000 students at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re calling you into a night of deep caring,&#8221; said Tim Galarneau, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">education and research specialist at the Center for Agroecology and Co-Chair of the UC-wide Basic Needs Initiative,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during his welcome speech at the Advancing the Road Map to Student Food Security benefit dinner at UCSC&#8217;s Hay Barn on June 2. He invited attendees to open their hearts as they learned about the transformative work that UCSC is doing to increase food security for students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundraising from ticket sales and individual donations has reached over $110,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term fundraising goal is $1.2 million by 2025; more on that later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of the work that our campus is doing to support student basic needs,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive in her remarks that night. &#8220;It&#8217;s a collaboration between our divisions of social sciences and student affairs and success. The basic needs concept is simple and powerful. It&#8217;s the acknowledgment that for students to succeed, their basic needs must be supported. Whether it&#8217;s food, housing, health and wellness, financial support, or a combination of all those things. Our Basic Needs program provides support for students that&#8217;s desperately needed&#8212;especially as our numbers of first-generation and low-income students continue to rise.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s event celebrated </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/foodways-fund.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s new roadmap for student food security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which shows how the university will achieve food security through five key initiatives: Field-to-Plate Food Security, Student-Centered Basic Needs Research and Assessment, Expanded Access and Food Pantry Resources, Holistic CalFresh Support, and the Slug Support Program. The Division of Student Affairs and Success, led by Vice Chancellor Akirah Bradley-Armstrong, oversees the latter three initiatives and plays a pivotal role in ensuring physical, mental/emotional, and intellectual nourishment for all UCSC students.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Foundation Board as galvanizing force </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, UCSC&#8217;s Basic Needs cross-divisional programs served nearly 6,400 students. But the needs of our students are higher than current resources can meet, and the UCSC Foundation Board of Trustees provided the necessary funding to plan for the future.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are very strong proponents of student success, which is a signature effort by the Chancellor to make this a better campus,&#8221; says Board Chair Richard Moss. &#8220;We hoped that such an effort would yield an immediate and substantial positive impact on the campus generally and student success in particular. If you can&#8217;t eat and you don&#8217;t have housing, you&#8217;re not going to study.&#8221; They realized this was something they could help with, and they wanted to tap into the power of the board acting as a collective body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last fall, the trustees committed to allocating $75,000 to support efforts addressing food insecurity and deliver an actionable plan to make these resources sustainable. It took a lot of planning and many people coming together from across campus to accomplish what has been done so far &#8211; including the Center for Agroecology, the Division of Student Affairs and Success, the Social Sciences, students themselves, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trustees have since made more personal commitments and contributions, which means that all proceeds from the Foodways dinner&#8212;including tickets sold, and additional donations people made that night&#8212;will go directly towards supporting the finalization and implementation of UCSC&#8217;s food security roadmap project. &#8220;This will result in students receiving food, assistance in qualifying for CalFresh funding, and education about other pathways to food security, as well as life skills and basic nutrition,&#8221; says Moss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent UC-wide survey found that more than 40% of undergraduate students reported either very low or low food security. &#8220;We heard that UC Regents had a mandate for every UC campus to have a food security pathway, to find a way to reduce food insecurity by 50% by 2025,&#8221; says Moss. &#8220;This happened before the pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, none of the campuses have come up with a food security pathway. Santa Cruz is the first campus in the UC system to do so."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation Trustee Janet Buck, one of the many trustees in attendance last Friday, referred to the evening as &#8220;a joyous celebration of the extraordinary work of UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology. Through sharing a meal, it highlighted the many ways they integrate students in their programs, support the broader student population, and align with issues in the broader agricultural ecosystem,&#8221; says Buck. She not only attended, but also sponsored an entire table, so that she could &#8220;both bring in dear friends to experience what I feel, and also share the essence of what it means to be connected to the Slugs while supporting this worthy program. It is a true privilege to be part of this community.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trustee Greg Reyes (Kresge &#8217;76) also sponsored a table. &#8220;I thought this would be a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">good opportunity to both educate my tablemates about the important issue of food insecurity, affecting so many college students, and also provide them an opportunity to actively participate in a local UCSC and community solution.&#8221; Part of the reason he joined the UC Santa Cruz Foundation is because he is sincerely grateful for his UCSC education. &#8220;My attendance at UC Santa Cruz was critical to what I have been able to achieve in my professional and personal life, impacting not just me but those around me. &#8216;Giving back&#8217; to UCSC is a way for me to enable and empower others to make their own way forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Peers helping peers&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emily Sanchez Reyes, CalFresh Outreach Team student lead, started working on the Basic Needs team in May 2021 and is graduating later this month with a BA in Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies. &#8220;Something I&#8217;ve learned from my major is the ability to look at things for more than face value and to honor and lift the voices of people with lived experiences. This has made my understanding of basic needs much more thorough.&#8221; She loves being able to work with her peers: the people in her classes, her TAs, etc. &#8220;I think as students we are much more willing to open up and access these services&#8212;especially because there&#8217;s a stigma around it. When it&#8217;s someone you know that works for CalFresh, or someone you know that&#8217;s also received CalFresh, this makes it much easier to accept those resources into your life.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriela Anger has been a student worker at Cowell Coffee Shop for two years. Prior to that, she was an intern at the farm. She is graduating this spring and is very excited that in the fall she will return to UCSC as a staff member&#8212;becoming assistant kitchen manager of the Cowell Coffee Shop. She talked about how important this spot has been to her, and to the other students and staff who work there, and to the hundreds of students who pass through the doors every day, being fed organic, culturally relevant meals. &#8220;It&#8217;s a really special thing to be able to make and serve food that plays a part in the fight for food justice,&#8221; said Anger. &#8220;I hope you all feel the time and love that went into your meal tonight,&#8221; she added, her face beaming.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Chef and Menu</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first dinner course&#8212;a stunning dish in terms of color, texture, and flavor&#8212;featured Napa cabbage, golden beets, cilantro, and white sesame seeds, plus a special sauce created by James Beard-award-winning and Michelin-starred chef Brandon Jew, executive chef and owner of Mr. Jiu&#8217;s restaurant in San Francisco. Several months ago, the chef asked UCSC if it would be possible to grow certain things at the farm for his menu: the aforementioned beets, cabbage, and cilantro, plus bok choy, scallions, and chrysanthemums. The answer was a resounding yes, just one of the many examples of people collaborating for success&#8212;for the dinner itself and for the program and students it benefits.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other menu items included a wonderful union of Chef Jew&#8217;s creativity, ultra-fresh just-harvested produce from the UCSC Farm, and local artisans: the fish course was &#8220;sizzled Ocean2Table black cod&#8221; with bok choy, snap peas, young ginger, and scallions. Santa Cruz-based Ocean2Table, from UCSC alumni Ian Cole and Charlie Lambert, is a CSF (similar to a produce CSA, but in this case, a community supported fishery). UCSC students helped prepare and cook the entire menu.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did Jew end up donating his time and staff to this event? Darryl Wong (Kresge, &#8217;12; Ph.D. &#8217;23), executive director of the Center for Agroecology, says it started when he and Brooks Schmitt (Porter</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8217;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">13</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) were texting after last year&#8217;s successful Foodways event with Alice Waters. Schmitt said how it would be great to get Brandon Jew for this year&#8217;s event. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of my favorite chefs,&#8221; said Schmitt, who serves many roles including the center&#8217;s Cowell Coffee Shop Food Supervisor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One text message later, Wong says, the decision was made. &#8220;Hey Brandon, do you want to do an event for food security at UCSC?&#8221; He immediately replied, &#8220;Heck yeah, I&#8217;m in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s all it took. His generosity and immediate willingness are emblematic of the Basic Needs village as a whole. &#8220;This is really a community of people that are willing to do the hard work to make our students&#8217; lives just a little bit easier,&#8221; says Wong.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn&#8217;t hurt that Jew was familiar with the UCSC Farm after buying the farm&#8217;s produce for several years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t get out of my own kitchen very often, but this is a very worthy cause and I&#8217;m really happy to be part of it,&#8221; says Jew, who thanked attendees for their support at the end of the night. &#8220;I hope other UCs learn from what you guys are doing here. I think it&#8217;s really important, the work that this really special program is about.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the produce included in the dinner was grown at the farm; the rest was from local growers (snap peas came from Pinnacle Farm, and mushrooms came from Santa Cruz Community Farmers&#8217; Market, one of the UCSC Farm&#8217;s active partners). Nicole Zahm, who serves as SCCFM Communication and Programs manager, attended the event. &#8220;It was moving to hear the students speak and to take note of the level of leadership and ownership they have over the Basic Needs Program,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This team is clearly passionate and invested in the labor of food security and I was glad to know the Board was unified in supporting this essential work.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Students involved in all stages</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Francis Ge, who serves as Basic Needs Coordinator, and the Basic Needs team are focused on getting input from students at basic needs sites, asking questions like, &#8220;What are foods/ingredients relevant to your culture that you aren&#8217;t finding at the local grocery store, that you would like access to? Perhaps something your grandmother used?&#8221; One result of asking these questions: the team comes up with a wish list of crops, and as they can, they add crops to what the UCSC Farm grows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big part of Ge&#8217;s job is coordinating and helping manage production and distribution with students. &#8220;A lot of it is training student staff and interns in everything from crop planning to transplanting to harvest (via the Field Team, with Field Manager Kirstin Yogg),&#8221; says Ge. Who exactly harvests the produce that nourishes students in need? Over 150 undergraduate student interns. There are also paid students and staff that help.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ge also interacts with the farmers' market, does distribution, and supervises the Produce Pop-Up student team. &#8220;And now that the first group of student staff is trained, they get to teach the new students coming in,&#8221; she adds.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The training gives students vital skills. So, in addition to food insecurity being healed in the short term through assistance that UCSC provides, the campus is also teaching skills that will help students throughout their lives. Students that helped prep and cook at the event were Cowell Coffee Shop student staff, co-leads, and interns. The servers (except the wine team), dish pit, and setup and cleanup crews were students from the coffee shop, Field Team, Produce Pop-Up, Farm Garden, and communications. &#8220;We also had some help from Center staff and Tim&#8217;s family and friends,&#8221; says Ge. &#8220;Basically, a huge team effort with students from across the Center for Agroecology.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><strong>It doesn&#8217;t matter what&#8217;s in your wallet</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what&#8217;s in your wallet, it&#8217;s about what you need to succeed,&#8221; said Galarneau during the program. &#8220;Basic needs is about caring for one another. About honoring the non-linear reality of basic needs. One minute you have food, one minute you have housing, the next minute you don&#8217;t.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure students have resources for success is the Basic Needs team&#8217;s goal. Estefania Rodriguez (Merrill &#8217;15), who serves as Dean of Students Basic Needs Program Manager, spoke about these resources. &#8220;The Redwood Free Market is a non-transactional market space,&#8221; she explained. At this location, students can access a free food pantry that stocks produce grown on the UCSC Farm, pantry staples donated by campus partner Second Harvest Food Bank and other items donated from local places like campus partner New Leaf Community Markets. The market has expanded to offer services like a diaper assistance program and CalFresh application assistance, and they added a sustainable toiletry dispenser where students can get things like shampoo, laundry detergent and soap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, 2,100 students &#8211; over 12% of the population &#8211; successfully enrolled in CalFresh thanks to the Basic Needs team. The plan is to increase enrollment and renewal numbers to 20% of the population by 2025; this will bring an additional four million dollars in CalFresh annual dollars to students, and then into our regional food system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Cowell Coffee Shop, students can get free ready-to-eat delicious meals (including rotating dishes like ramen, tamales, and frittatas with seasonal ingredients) plus fresh juices and more. &#8220;When you have this resource where you can get food for free, every day, that is a very different way of thinking about food,&#8221; says Wong. &#8220;Everyone has a right to have food &#8211; you have this right because you are a human. If you have this experience while you are a UCSC student, for four years, it will change what you do when you graduate. And that is really important to think about when we think about the next generation of changemakers, the folks that will impact our food system and impact our society at large, that is the impact we are trying to have through this really broad-based collaborative effort, across so many different divisions and departments.&#8221; The effort displays the university&#8217;s commitment to intersectional and equity-driven work.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Finale</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fun bonus: each attendee got to take home a jar of homemade organic strawberry jam cooked by students. The recipe is from Schmitt&#8217;s grandmother (restaurateur Sally Schmitt, founder of renowned restaurant The French Laundry). What a yummy, tangible reminder of the evening and themes of food, students, training, nourishment, and collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schmitt thanked the crowd for all of their support, and said, &#8220;One of the biggest things about this road map that we really try to do is bring in so many different types of foodways to represent the many types of students that are here on this campus. So, being able to bring in absolute rock stars like Brandon to show what Chinese cooking is in California, and the ways in which he takes these ingredients from these farms and tells the stories of the diaspora, and in such exciting new ways, is so incredible and inspirational to us. Every time we get to do something like this, our students come away and cook completely differently. Because college students are brilliant, creative, and dynamic.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evening ended on two perfect notes. First, the exquisite dessert was a wonderful homage to the chef&#8217;s heritage while bringing in creativity for a unique interpretation (UCSC Farm strawberries stacked in a cordial glass bowl with black sesame cream, white tea jelly, and meringue). Second, the biggest applause of the night was&#8212;deservedly so&#8212;for the students. As the student workers walked into the barn at the end of the program, everyone at the dining tables spontaneously stood up and gave them a giant standing ovation and booming cheers, acknowledging their hard work both tonight and throughout the school year, in classrooms and libraries, in the fields, and in the kitchens. And after that, they went outside where they were going to feast on the same food that they had served to attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of my favorite things about the event was seeing the students who prepared and served such a fantastic meal and being able to honor them for it,&#8221; said Moss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what the night was about: taking care of our students and ensuring they have the resources to reach their full potential. And this is what the Advancing the Road Map to Student Food Security campaign is about. UCSC is planning to raise $1.2 million in the next two years, to help with the goals of reducing food and housing insecurity by 50% by 2025. &#8220;The funds raised from the dinner only represent a minimal down payment on the full cost of achieving food security, which is why UCSC and the greater Santa Cruz community must come together to support the implementation of UCSC&#8217;s food security pathway,&#8221; says Moss.</span></p>

She will be responsible for leading operations and fostering impactful technological innovation on campus through the center.<br/><br/>"I am very honored and excited to become the new UCSC CITRIS Director and carry on the important mission of the institute,&#8221; Obraczka said. &#8220;My goal is to continue to expand UCSC CITRIS engagement with faculty and students across campus and with our sister campuses, working on interdisciplinary research that uses technology for the social good. I am really looking forward to increasing the visibility and footprint of CITRIS at UCSC by expanding its research and education portfolio and fostering more collaboration with industry."<br/><br/>CITRIS and the Banatao Institute is a multi-campus research center that includes UC Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Davis and Merced focused on IT research with societal and economic benefits for all. It aims to shorten the pipeline between innovative research on emerging technologies in labs across these campuses and its application, in partnership with government and private industry. Core technology initiatives include CITRIS Aviation, Climate, Health, and People and Robots.&#160;<br/><br/>At UC Santa Cruz, CITRIS programs include the Campus Seed Funding Program, which supports early stage interdisciplinary research; the Tech for Social Good funding program for student projects; and the CITRIS Initiative for Drone Education and Research. The strengths of CITRIS UCSC faculty and researchers include the design of microgrids and energy-management solutions, machine learning in monitoring and control of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and data analytics, the application of control theory and formal methods in the design of CPS, and new Internet of Things (IoT) protocols and systems aiming at solving important environmental and societal issues. UCSC Professor of Electrical Engineering Ricardo Sanfelice leads the CITRIS Aviation Initiative.&#160;<br/><br/>UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive called Obraczka a great fit for the position: &#8220;Katia&#8217;s work fully embraces the CITRIS mission of fostering rich interdisciplinary research that benefits society. I look forward to her leadership in bringing together brilliant minds from across our campus and at our partner institutions to tackle the pressing issues of our day.&#8221;&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Obraczka is an expert in computer networks, distributed systems, internet information systems, and operating systems. She runs the internet Research Group, which studies all levels of networking design including data center design, network security, wireless sensor networks, IoT and edge computing and intelligence.<br/><br/>Her research has focused on developing tools to monitor wildfire risk, such as a decision-support tool called EUREKA that uses a sensor network and drones to provide information about environmental conditions. Another project, called the Pressure Injury Monitoring and Prevention project, uses sensors with a monitoring software to provide data about the risk of pressure injuries, or bed sores, for patients with low mobility.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Katia applies her extensive expertise in Internet of Things research to create innovative and dynamic networks that connect sensors, devices, and software to solve environmental and health care problems, showing a dedication to developing technology for the benefit of society across a diverse range of applications,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;This area is one that is ripe for exploration and development, and I&#8217;m so pleased that Katia will guide our students and researchers in taking on impactful projects in this field and beyond.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Obraczka will take over UCSC CITRIS leadership from Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering J.J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, who has served in the position since 2018.&#160;<br/><br/>Obraczka received B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and an M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Southern California. She served as a research scientist and faculty member at USC&#8217;s Department of Computer Science before joining the UCSC Baskin School of Engineering in 2001.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c0d7425f807270460d0ef562dbaddf60"><name>farm-robotics-challenge</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Interdisciplinary team wins Small Farm prize in first-ever Farm Robotics Challenge</title><summary>An interdisciplinary team of students and researchers created an autonomous weeder which was recently recognized with the Small Farm prize at the inaugural Farm Robotics Challenge. </summary><start-date>1686812400000</start-date><path>/2023/06/farm-robotics-challenge</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/06/farm-robotics-challenge</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1686862512715</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1686863624958</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zh355WAhoWA" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></embed><width>560</width><caption>The Farm Robotics team's video demonstration of their project.</caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/teampic_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/teampic_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teampic_400.jpg</name><display-name>teampic_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>44822</file-size><width>450</width><height>361</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/teampic_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/teampic_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>teampic_80.jpg</name><display-name>teampic_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>6085</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>The farm robotics team smiles while at the UCSC farm</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC Farm Robotics Challenge team. From left to right: row 1 Darryl Wong; row 2 Joshua Gamlen, Mauricio Chavez, and Katherine Rogacheva; row 3 Oliver Fuchs, Dejan Milutinovic.</span></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="text-align: left;">On the UC Santa Cruz farm, a small self-driving tractor navigates itself over a line of broccoli, avoiding the crops while removing the weeds that may interfere with their growth. This autonomous weeder is the work of a team of students co-advised by Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Dejan Milutinovic and Executive Director at the UCSC Center for Agroecology Darryl Wong, and has been recently recognized with the Small Farm prize at the inaugural Farm Robotics Challenge.&#160;<br/><br/>Members of the &#8220;Electrified Slugs&#8221; team Joshua Gamlen (computer engineering), Katherine Rogacheva (robotics engineering), Mauricio Chavez (agroecology), and Oliver Fuchs (robotics engineering) collaborated to create their submission for the Farm Robotics Challenge, a competition which presents students with real-life farm automation scenarios in order for them to gain practical experience with robotics in agriculture.&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br/>&#8220;This project is really exciting because it&#8217;s bridging what sometimes can feel like really distinct worlds,&#8221; Wong said. &#8220;It speaks to the strength of UC Santa Cruz and how it approaches Ag Tech, that we can have these conversations that seemingly come from different worlds, but do a really good job to inform and support each other.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Nineteen student teams from 12 universities across the country participated in the challenge, and all teams had access to small small electric tractors from <a href="https://farm-ng.com/">Farm-ng</a>, a Watsonville-based robotics hardware and software company, upon which they had to build their solutions.&#160;<br/><br/>The Electrified Slug&#8217;s project focused on the development of the autonomous navigation software to allow the electric tractor to safely and efficiently weed plant lines on small, diversified organic farms, using the UCSC farm as a model for this problem. They chose this project focus after identifying labor costs and weeding as two of the biggest challenges facing local organic growers in California. Hand weeding and stooping can contribute to significant <span style="font-weight: 400;">musculoskeletal</span> issues for farmers and farm workers in organic systems.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>To develop their solution, Milutinovic and his students used feedback control navigation, which is based on an original nonlinear mathematical model for relative motion between the tractor&#8217;s weeding tools and a plant line. They implemented the navigation on the Farm-ng tractor&#8217;s onboard computer and created a user interface which allowed the navigation to use visual information from the tractor-mounted camera. Users have the flexibility to mount the camera at a desired position to see the tractor tools and to identify plants without much calibration or intervention.&#160;<br/><br/>Importantly, this vision-based navigation can uniquely function across a wide range of crops as would be found on a diversified organic farm, a distinct difference from larger monocrop operations.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;At this point we are pushing the envelope of what is possible in food production,&#8221; Milutinovic said. &#8220;And it's not naive since we have to deal with uncertainties of operations on real farms.&#160; Robotics have decades of development, but we are just now in the position to get these robots outdoors and do some real stuff. That's really exciting.&#8221;</p>
<div>The team is also working with <a href="https://albafarmers.org/">ALBA</a>, a local non-profit that provides land-based, organic farm management training to low-income field workers to help them pursue their goals of farm ownership. Over the summer, the team will continue to work with farmers in the ALBA program to conduct semi-structured interviews about the technology and how these specific growers view the potential and challenges to guide further development. This portion of the project will be led by environmental studies graduate student Summer Sullivan and Maurico Chavez.&#160;&#160;&#160;</div>
<p><br/>&#8220;The part of this project that feels most exciting is making sure we're approaching this nascent and potentially really disruptive form of innovation with a lens of inclusive and responsible innovation, to account for what we know are the harmful things that have happened historically during the process of these innovation cycles,&#8221; Wong said. &#8220;We're engaging in these conversations about why it is important that we understand how we frame innovation, and what we're trying to innovate toward &#8212; is it really just about efficiency or is it about people in the communities who are growing this food?&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>The project has garnered enthusiasm for socially-impactful agricultural technology among students, both those on the team and those who work on the farm and have watched the tractor&#8217;s development. Several students from the team have accepted internships or full-time positions in related fields, and both advisors noted that students not involved in the project were curious to learn more about the tractor and the team&#8217;s work.<br/><br/>All teams in the competition, which included many of the traditional powerhouse agriculture schools, were judged on multiple criteria including design elegance and ease of use, interdisciplinary inclusion, and societal and economic impact. The competition was put on by AI Institute for Next Gen Food Systems (AIFS), UC Agriculture and Natural Resources VINE, Fresno-Merced Future of Food (F3) Innovation, and Farm-ng.<br/><br/>With their win of the Small Farm prize, the team received $5,000 and a trip to Salinas in September to present at FIRA USA, a networking and demo event for autonomous farming and agricultural robotics solutions.<br/><br/>This research has been supported by a $40,000 CITRIS Campus Seed Funding and additional private gift funding.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4e067a3807270460d0ef5622b4cdff7"><name>june-campus-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus update: Quarter ends today, congrats to new graduates, still time to enroll in Summer Session</title><summary>Today marks the final day of spring quarter and the start of commencement!</summary><start-date>1686812400000</start-date><display-name>Campus update: Quarter ends today, congrats to new graduates, still time to enroll in Summer Session</display-name><path>/2023/06/june-campus-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/06/june-campus-update</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1686930220945</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1686930220945</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Today marks the final day of spring quarter and the start of commencement!

<h2><span>Still time to add a Summer Session Class</span></h2>
<p><span>While spring-quarter classes are over, it&#8217;s not too late to add a Summer Session class! Summer classes, both in-person and online, are a great way for students to make progress toward their educational goals, and you can add a class right up until the first session starts June 26. On-campus Summer Session housing is also still available. Visit the </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://summer.ucsc.edu/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1687012488825000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qw_Z-tUb5LcvUM0Evqymo" href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Summer Session website</span></a>&#160;</span><span>for details. Another reason to consider summertime learning: Under our new </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/04/summer-session-program.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1687012488825000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DURAIleRNtVA6lHk227Wb" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/04/summer-session-program.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Pay For Only 10 program</span></a></span><span>, all current and incoming UCSC undergraduates will only pay for up to 10 credits of summer tuition, even if taking more than 10 credits. This means students can make degree progress this summer at reduced cost.</span></p>

<p><span>June is Pride Month, which is an opportunity for us to celebrate the accomplishments and successes the LGBTQIA+ community has had in creating a more just and equitable world, where all people are respected, treated fairly, and provided equal opportunities inclusive of all sexual and gender identities. It was wonderful to see the strong turnout we had at the annual Santa Cruz Pride at the start</span><span> </span><span>of the month, plus the love given to Sammy, who was marching with our campus contingent. Our campus commitment to protect the fundamental rights of the LGBTQIA+ community is crucial in light of the many efforts being undertaken nationwide to roll back basic human rights. Many seek to disenfranchise transgender and nonbinary people, undermine existing protections for LGBTQIA+ people, and restrict discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. In the face of these challenges, it is essential that we stand alongside our trans and queer community members this month and every month, and be vocal in our support.</span></p>

At a time when diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are under attack nationally, I thought it would be helpful to share our campus experience working to build a leadership team that better reflects our student body. Our campus benefits greatly from a tremendous team of leaders who bring a variety of experiences and backgrounds to their work and to our community. Though there is more work to be done to realize the campus climate we desire and deserve, I believe we have made progress in recent years hiring leaders who understand the value of diverse perspectives in the workplace and classroom.</span>&#160;</p>
<h2><span>Foodways dinner a resounding success</span></h2>
<p><span>Congrats to all who took part in the recent Foodways Dinner at the UCSC Farm. Our Center for Agroecology presented the fundraising dinner to celebrate the recently launched &#8220;Roadmap to Student Food Security&#8221; project sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees. The evening was also an opportunity to acknowledge the incredible work of our students, staff, and faculty partners committed to advancing student success, especially as it relates to food insecurity. All told, more than $110,000 was raised through ticket sales and personal donations, many of which were made by members of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation board, who have shown an earnest commitment and deep interest in meeting student basic needs. All funds raised will be channeled to various projects detailed in the roadmap. Thank you to all involved!</span>&#160;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The power of the humanities comes from transforming life for the better by creating informed, empathetic and engaged members of the community and our world,&#8221; said UCSC Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer during the Spring Awards ceremony, which was held outside in the redwoods of the UCSC campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To sustain our democracy, we must be able to imagine each other as we do ourselves because democracy is built on respect for others,&#8221; Kletzer said. &#8220;We must be able to see the global in all issues, and the humanities position us to do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder introduced this year&#8217;s Distinguished Humanities Undergraduate Alumni Award honoree </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2023/03/helen-tran-a-term-of-firsts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helen Tran, (Rachel Carson, &#8216;04, American Studies), the first Asian American elected in the city of San Bernardino and the first Vietnamese-American mayor in the U.S.&#160;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tran, who addressed the crowd with a prerecorded video message, is the daughter of Vietnamese refugees. She became the first person in her family to graduate from college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I graduated, my thought at the time was to become a third-grade teacher, but my life, education, and experience have all prepared me for a different purpose in my career,&#8221; said Tran, who attributed much of her success to her UCSC mentor Judy Yung, a beloved professor of Asian American history who </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/judy-yung.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">died in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at age 74.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yung encouraged Tran to write a detailed oral history about her parents&#8217; decision to flee Vietnam and their perilous journey out of the country. &#8220;I ended up being mayor in the city that gave my family and me an opportunity to pursue the American dream,&#8221; Tran said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alinder also announced the winners of the Humanities Dean's Excellence Awards, which support student success in and out of the classroom. These awards go to students with financial needs who have demonstrated strong scholarship in support of the humanities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s awardees were Kelli K. Chinn (Oakes, &#8216;23, CRES), a first-generation transfer student, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adria Vidales (Oakes, &#8216;23, CRES and Environmental Studies).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recipient of the Sol and Esther Draznin Memorial Scholarship in Classical Studies is Jean Luke Shedid (Kresge, &#8216;25, Classical Studies and Applied Linguistics).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other honorees:&#160; Ben Goldstein (Porter, &#8216;23, Film &amp; Digital Media and Literature) received the David A. Kadish Humanities Scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Vanross (Oakes, &#8216;23, History)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Rachel Kedem (Crown, &#8216;24, Literature)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">received the Mollie Cass Sater Memorial Award.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angelo Claure (Oakes, &#8216;23, Philosophy)&#160; received the Dr. Raihan Kadri Memorial Scholarship.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starr Mitchell (Kresge, &#8216;23, History and Literature)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">received the Siobhan O&#8217;Neill Memorial Scholarship.&#160;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-profiles/2021-profiles/dakeya-sampson.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dakeya Sampson </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Rachel Carson, &#8216;23, Literature and Anthropology) received the Idstrom Family Prize For Creative Writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pamela Williams (Oakes, &#8216;23, Literature)&#160; received the Kenneth Andrew Gram Memorial Scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabriella Anger (Kresge, &#8216;23, Literature) received the Jay Family Humanities Scholarship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://honors.ucsc.edu/awards/dca/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleven students received Dean&#8217;s Awards, and three of them also received Chancellor&#8217;s Awards.&#160;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz (THI) recognized 13 undergraduate students who were selected as </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/announcing-this-2022-2023-undergraduate-public-fellows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THI Public Fellows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 10 undergraduate students who received THI Research Awards.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the ceremony, Alinder called attention to the breadth of knowledge and achievement of this year&#8217;s honorees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the Humanities at UC Santa Cruz, you see thinkers and doers reimagining the world and fully engaged in our biggest challenges,&#8221; Alinder said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate ceremony held on May 19 honoring Humanities graduate students and alumni,&#160; James E. Young (Stevenson, &#8217;73, Literature and Psychology) (Ph.D. &#8217;83, literature), addressed the crowd, talking about the way UCSC has supported him in his academic career. Earlier that day, the Graduate Division honored him with the Humanities Distinguished Graduate Alumni Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young is at the forefront of memorializing historical tragedies internationally. From advising on memorials in Germany and Norway to helping design the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, Young has had a hand in preserving the memory of thousands of lives lost to global tragedies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young is a Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of English and Judaic &amp; Near Eastern Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Division and The Humanities Institute acknowledged graduate student achievements and awards.&#160; Dean Alinder presented Emre Keser with the Gary Lease Fellowship, a divisional award.&#160;</span></p>

In August, he will step down as dean and take a sabbatical leave before returning to full-time teaching and research.</p>
<p>Dr. Bryan Gaensler, currently director of the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, will take the helm as the new dean of physical and biological sciences on August 15.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under Dean Koch&#8217;s&#160; leadership, the growth of the division has involved everything from its size and scope to impact, diversity, student accomplishments and prestige,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;He is a dogged advocate for the division, and that persistence comes from an unflagging belief in what the division&#8217;s faculty can do for science, for impact, and for our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Grant Hartzog, who served as associate dean for undergraduate education and is now chair of the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, praised Koch for his leadership style.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impressive that he has a good understanding of what every faculty member in the division is doing,&#8221; Hartzog said. &#8220;He&#8217;s very accessible when you have questions, and he helps look for solutions. When he says no, he tells you why. The decisions are well reasoned and transparent. And if he feels he&#8217;s made a mistake or something didn&#8217;t go well, he&#8217;ll apologize&#8212;he&#8217;s not defensive. He&#8217;s been a fantastic dean, and we&#8217;ll be sorry to see him go.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Focus on student success</h2>
<p>Under Koch&#8217;s leadership, the division has launched important new degree programs, seen dramatic growth in research funding, and made substantial changes to the science curriculum with a focus on improving student outcomes. Efforts to level the playing field for students who come from less privileged backgrounds are improving the undergraduate experience for all students and helping to boost retention and graduation rates for science majors.</p>
<p>An ambitious effort to revamp the division&#8217;s introductory science courses began in 2014 with support from a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) grant.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the beginning of much greater attention to the way we teach, recognizing that students learn in different ways, and expanding opportunities for students to have the kinds of transformative experiences that lead to them thriving in science,&#8221; Koch said.</p>
<p>Faculty in the division continue to work on improving the science curriculum through their involvement and leadership in HHMI&#8217;s<span> <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/05/hhmi-learning-community.html">Inclusive Excellence Learning Community</a></span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been incredibly attentive and supportive of those efforts, and that includes providing funds to people and projects, as well as convening meetings and navigating the academic senate,&#8221; Hartzog said. &#8220;These introductory science courses touch many different majors and programs, so just navigating that and getting the right people together to discuss it is a large and difficult task that he&#8217;s been managing.&#8221;</p>
<p>An Active Learning Classroom in the Science and Engineering Library and a growing number of teaching professors in the division also reflect the renewed emphasis on teaching and student success. In addition, the expansion of field courses and new course-based undergraduate research programs are helping to make research and field experiences accessible to more students.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all laps back onto equity and inclusion by making those courses and opportunities welcoming and accessible for all students,&#8221; Koch said. &#8220;The science division is here to recognize talent and help people reach their aspirations. We&#8217;re not here to weed anyone out, we&#8217;re here to develop and nurture talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The number of faculty in the division has grown substantially during Koch&#8217;s time as dean, with a large fraction of the current faculty having been hired during his tenure. In the process, the division has been working to increase the diversity of its faculty to be more representative of the student population. The proportion of women on the faculty has increased significantly, and progress is also being made in racial and ethnic diversity and representation of LGBTQ faculty, Koch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that leads to better science, because folks from different backgrounds bring different perspectives that lead to more creative solutions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>New majors and graduate programs</h2>
<p>New undergraduate degree programs launched under Koch&#8217;s leadership include the environmental sciences major, jointly run by the Departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences and Ocean Sciences; a new microbiology major in the Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology; and Global and Community Health, an interdisciplinary program offering B.A. and B.S. degrees, with faculty and courses from across the divisions.</p>
<p>At the graduate level, the Coastal Science and Policy program, an interdisciplinary master&#8217;s degree program administered jointly with the Social Sciences Division, launched in 2018. With a focus on solutions and practical skills for addressing real-world environmental challenges, the program is graduating strong cohorts of students with M.S. degrees, and it is also attracting students who want to earn a Ph.D. in another field with a designated emphasis in coastal science and policy. Starting this fall, new graduate degrees in materials science and engineering will also be offered, administered jointly with the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>New facilities for the division include the Biomedical Sciences Building (which was planned and largely completed before Koch came on as dean); the Coastal Biology Building, which opened at the Coastal Science Campus in 2017 along with a refurbished and expanded Marine Vertebrate Facility; and new materials science and engineering laboratories at the Westside Research Park.</p>
<h2>Research powerhouse</h2>
<p>On the research side, Koch said the growth in research funding has far outstripped the growth in the size of the faculty, reflecting the campus&#8217;s growing strength as a research powerhouse. Extramural research funding for the division in fiscal year 2022 was more than $85 million, and could top $100 million for 2023, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve doubled down on our strength in coastal science and climate resilience, and our stature in that area is reflected in getting state funding for the Center for Coastal Climate Resilience,&#8221; Koch said.</p>
<p>The division has also invested in building its strength in the biomedical sciences, establishing strong programs in areas such as neuroscience, stem cell biology, drug discovery, and infectious disease. The astronomy program has long been a strength of the campus, and it remains so after some faculty turnover driven in part by a period of uncertainty about long-term funding for UC Observatories.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we came out of that as strong as ever, maybe even stronger,&#8221; Koch said.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic was an extraordinary challenge for the entire campus, and enabling science students to have the usual hands-on learning experiences was especially difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to even put a finger on all that had to happen to keep the wheels on during the pandemic, but one example is that we still managed to have some field classes and lab classes when everything went online,&#8221; Koch said.</p>
<p>With campus operations mostly back normal, Koch said it feels like the right time for him to step down.</p>
<p>&#8220;These jobs need fresh ideas and new thinking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In general, I tried to lead by still somewhat operating as a faculty member, so I can better understand the experience of faculty as they navigate the campus. And I've led by channeling the best ideas people brought to me. All the ideas came from the faculty and staff and students, and I just tried to unleash their potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his upcoming sabbatical leave, Koch said he looks forward to developing a few ideas he has for new research projects, in addition to finishing up some stalled projects he hasn&#8217;t had time to work on. One of the new projects he has in mind would explore the past and future of California&#8217;s iconic redwoods.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been wanting to tackle for years, and now is the time to do it,&#8221; he said.</p>

The university&#8217;s educational values inspired him to make the long journey from Noida, India to Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma researches and teaches on issues related to global politics, development, social and labor movements, and gender inequalities. He is grateful to UCSC&#8217;s Sociology Department for allowing him conduct graduate research across a variety of disciplines. In 2021 he was awarded the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica L. Roy Memorial Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jessica L. Roy Memorial Award commemorates the work and legacy of Jessica Roy, whose work for women&#8217;s rights and water safety in Kenya is immortalized in a permanent endowment for graduate students focusing on an equitable distribution of natural resources, especially in the context of equity for women.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma&#8217;s graduate research in gender inequality and global politics has earned him a past accolade from The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Science Research Council </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for his dissertation &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">World(s) of Precarity: Place-making, time, and Labor struggles of informal workers in Delhi.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma&#8217;s work heavily depends on his work in India, which became difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. The inability to do field research for the duration of the pandemic put a damper on his work schedule. With the help of the Jessica L. Roy Memorial Award, Sharma can build from a strong foundation as he works on his research on both sides of the planet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an international student, I am generally supposed to be on a timeline and the award has provided critical support in a time when I have been figuring how to start/travel to my field to remain on track with things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma credits UCSC with developing his interdisciplinary viewpoint, in ethnographic courses that have proved critical to his work in sociological studies. What especially stood out to Sharma in his education was how holistically engaged his peers were in the material: not only did he find eye-opening discussion and discourse in his graduate-level courses, but also in the conversations between the undergraduate students he taught as a TA.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have loved taking critical classes on ethnographies of work, movements, feminism, and many others,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;The amazing part is that such discussions don&#8217;t stop there and enter into spaces of discussion sections, while working as a TA, with undergraduates.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma&#8217;s fields of study, from gender inequality to equitable distribution, are as myriad as his goals for post-graduate work. After completing his degree, Sharma hopes to contribute to combatting the inequalities of the world alongside becoming a professor.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope to continue researching and teaching on issues related to global politics, development, social and labor movements, and gender inequalities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My ideal situation will be to have a combination of being full-time professor, policy work, and grassroots organizing.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e5cbc297807270460ecc34cde7f972dc"><name>usda-10m-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz receives $10 million grant to cultivate diverse food and agriculture professionals</title><summary>The United States Department of Agriculture awarded the University of California, Santa Cruz a $10 million grant to lead a transformative five-year project.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project, done in collaboration with California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), Hartnell College, and Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA), aims to empower and support many different types of students who may be interested in embarking on careers in the dynamic realms of food and agriculture. By providing comprehensive education, experiential training, and unparalleled leadership opportunities, the program seeks to nurture a diverse and inclusive cohort of future leaders who will shape the industry's trajectory.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz and our partner institutions have been working for years to train the next leaders in agroecology and related fields,&#8221; said project director Stacy Philpott, Professor of Environmental Studies and Faculty Director for the Center for Agroecology. &#8220;This grant will allow us to supersize our efforts to provide students with experiential learning possibilities, mentoring and coaching, and with substantial financial resources, all while bringing a significant focus on justice and equity in the food system,&#8221; Philpott said. &#8220;It is exciting to have the opportunity to support learners from diverse backgrounds and ages &#8211; from elementary school to the Ph.D. level to farmworkers &#8211; and to encourage them to appreciate that knowledge is held and generated from multiple sources.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project co-directors at UC Santa Cruz include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Environmental Studies Professor Flora Lu, Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Maywa Montenegro, Center for Agroecology Research &amp; Education Coordinator Damian Parr, Environmental Studies Professor and Department Chair Jeffrey Bury, and Becca Fenwick Director of the CITRIS Initiative for Drone Education and Research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commencing on June 15, 2023, this grant will enable UC Santa Cruz to provide crucial financial support to approximately 40 graduate students pursuing doctoral and master's degrees, 400 undergraduate students, and 50 K-12 youth annually. Furthermore, in collaboration with ALBA, the initiative will extend its reach to approximately 75 farmworkers each year, fortifying the resilience and well-being of those driving the industry forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond direct support, the project will engage an even wider audience through counseling, advising, immersive events, and enlightening career panels. By fostering an ecosystem of mentorship, guidance, and collaboration, UC Santa Cruz aims to touch the lives of countless students, equipping them with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in the evolving landscape of food and agriculture.</span></p>

<p>The grant will fund a new project to develop alternatives to the use of precious metals such as platinum and palladium for catalyzing important reactions. Precious metals play essential roles in catalysts for many of the chemical transformations involved in industrial processes ranging from fuel production to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. These transition metals have many useful properties but are relatively rare and expensive.</p>
<p>Johnstone&#8217;s group has discovered new types of chemical bonds and molecular structures that can endow more abundant elements like antimony, bismuth, tin, and lead with the kind of reactivity that could make them useful as catalysts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transition metals inherently have diverse and complex reactivity, but there is increasing recognition that other elements on the periodic table can do equally interesting chemistry,&#8221; Johnstone said. &#8220;You have to work for it more and build the right molecular structure to activate them. But being able to use more Earth-abundant elements would be more economical and more sustainable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnstone&#8217;s interest in this area began when his lab was studying the chemistry of certain drugs with antimony in them. &#8220;We came to realize there were fundamental gaps in our understanding of the chemistry of antimony, and we noticed previously unexplored types of bonds between antimony and oxygen, called terminal oxo bonds,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a molecular motif, these heavy element terminal oxo bonds are fundamentally interesting, and they can mediate interesting reactions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnstone&#8217;s lab succeeded in isolating the first monomeric stibine oxide and is now investigating the kinds of chemistry that can be done using such compounds. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop more sustainable alternatives to the use of precious metals as catalysts. But much of the work involves exploring the fundamental chemistry of these novel chemical structures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I very much appreciate the Beckman Foundation for funding a project that is quite fundamental in nature,&#8221; Johnstone said. &#8220;Although we might be interested in this chemistry for catalytic purposes, once we have identified new bonding motifs and understand new reactions, that&#8217;s a whole new section in the textbook and a new set of building blocks that chemists have at their disposal for all kinds of applications. That&#8217;s the value of this kind of fundamental research&#8212;it generates new knowledge that everybody has access to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Beckman Young Investigator Program provides research support to the most promising young faculty members in the early stages of their academic careers in the chemical and life sciences, particularly to foster the invention of methods, instruments, and materials that will open up new avenues of research in science.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e95761a7807270460ecc34cd8e6fe04b"><name>vegetation-surveys</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC Arboretum to conduct vegetation surveys under $2.6M state contract</title><summary>A team of UCSC botanists will carry out surveys for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in support of a statewide vegetation classification and mapping program.</summary><keywords>Brett Hall</keywords><start-date>1687762800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Arboretum to conduct vegetation surveys under $2.6M state contract</display-name><path>/2023/06/vegetation-surveys</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/06/vegetation-surveys</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1687541997974</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1687795001342</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/veg-team-3489-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/veg-team-3489-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>veg-team-3489-500.jpg</name><display-name>veg-team-3489-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>201341</file-size><width>500</width><height>628</height></image><image-alt>botantists conducting survey</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/06/images/veg-team-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/06/images/veg-team-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>veg-team-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>veg-team-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18863</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>botanist conducting survey</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>A team of UCSC botanists led by Brett Hall, director of the Arboretum&#8217;s California Native Plant Program, is conducting vegetation surveys for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife&#8217;s VegCAMP program.

<p>A team of botanists led by Brett Hall, director of the Arboretum&#8217;s California Native Plant Program, will carry out the surveys, focusing primarily on three main geographic areas: the Northern Sierra Nevada, Central California Interior Coast Ranges, and Northern California Interior Coast Ranges.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is important conservation work for the state,&#8221; Hall said. &#8220;Many vegetation types are becoming rare or face threats from fragmentation and invasive weeds, and this project will allow us to see what we have in California on a fine scale and make that information available to support conservation and management decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The VegCAMP program aims to survey the entire state according to new protocols developed by CDFW and the California Native Plant Society for sampling and classifying vegetation types. These protocols comply with state and federal standards and will provide a more consistent and accurate representation of vegetation types throughout the state.</p>
<p>The Arboretum team will be focusing on areas of the state that have not previously been surveyed using these protocols. Other groups are also involved in the VegCAMP effort, which has received $20 million in funding from the state.</p>
<p>Lucy Ferneyhough, project manager for the Arboretum&#8217;s Native Plant Program, said all the data they collect will be publicly available. &#8220;Vegetation maps have been completed for a few areas and are available for land managers,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These maps can help with fire planning and vegetation management and can help land trusts determine where to acquire land to create effective habitat corridors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arboretum botanist Alex Hubner emphasized the importance of having good baseline data on California&#8217;s vegetation types. &#8220;We don&#8217;t necessarily know what&#8217;s out there, and we need to get a snapshot of what we have now so we can observe how it changes and identify areas that are at risk and in need of management,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hubner explained that when the team heads out to a site, they start with a general idea of what might be there, but what they find in the field directs the survey process. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to find plant community types that are recurring and predictable across the landscape,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There might be a stand of chamise, and then another area with chamise and bigberry manzanita, and those are two distinct vegetation types, so we&#8217;ll do a survey within each type to represent those plant communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mapping side of the program relies on aerial imagery of the landscape. By looking at the data collected in the field and correlating it with the overhead images, mappers can predict the locations and extent of each vegetation type.</p>
<p>According to Ferneyhough, conservation efforts have often tended to focus on individual species rather than communities and ecosystems. &#8220;Vegetation mapping can direct more attention to rare communities and habitats, so we can prioritize the protection of entire habitats,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Hall, Ferneyhough, and Hubner have been involved in several earlier surveys using the VegCAMP protocols, giving them the expertise CDFW sought for the new contract. They are hiring a team of experienced botanists to join them in this project, including two recent graduates of UCSC who worked at the Arboretum as student interns.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Native Plant Program at the Arboretum is a far-reaching effort to collect good plant materials for education, research, and conservation purposes,&#8221; Hall said. &#8220;We are learning a great deal about the state&#8217;s vegetation through this new project, and the knowledge and skills we gain will help us teach students how to look at vegetation and understand the new classifications.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fab621e68072704636d94c4d2952bc57"><name>macmillan-qa</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Q&amp;A with John MacMillan, vice chancellor for research</title><summary>After nearly two years as the interim Vice Chancellor for Research (VCR) for UC Santa Cruz, John MacMillan was appointed to the permanent VCR role on June 1, 2023, after a nationwide search.

<p><strong>Q: Tell me a little bit about yourself and what drives you in your work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> One of the things that really motivates me in this position is being a first-generation college student. I was given the opportunity to carry out undergraduate research while I was at the University of Iowa, and that really opened up a lot of possibilities for my future. Research has given me a lot in life, and I&#8217;ve seen the tremendous benefits to both researchers and the greater public that comes out of high-quality research. The ability to support [research] on our campus was an exciting prospect for me.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Q: You have been focusing a lot on the student experience. What are your plans to support undergraduate and graduate research?</strong></p>
<p>A: The evidence is clear that experiential learning opportunities help students succeed, graduate, and excel in internships, professional school, graduate school, and real-world careers. As an R-1, HSI (Hispanic-Serving Institution) university, we have a vital role in increasing these opportunities, especially for those of diverse backgrounds. We aim to help faculty expand <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/research-experiences-undergraduates-reu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">REUs </a>(Research Experiences for Undergraduates) through funding from organizations like the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) to enhance lab courses and provide paid undergraduate researcher opportunities. Our goal is to ensure students have access to the newest research and gain valuable hands-on experience, better preparing them for their future endeavors.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Q: What is your vision for the Office of Research?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Over the past decade, the campus has experienced significant growth in various areas, including funding, impact, and student population. However, the support systems have not grown at the same pace as scientific advancements, leading to some growing pains. Our vision is to ensure the research infrastructure is well-supported and that we are providing administrative support as well as cutting-edge facilities. Additionally, we recognize the need to promote and share the truly amazing research happening on our campus. We aim to tell the stories of our work, engage alumni, and support UC Santa Cruz research in meaningful and impactful ways. Selling ourselves better is one step towards achieving this goal.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Q: What does UCSC do really well in regard to research?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> UC Santa Cruz is known for its excellence in research across all divisions, including arts, humanities, physical sciences, social sciences, and engineering. What sets UC Santa Cruz apart is its commitment to social justice and diversity, interwoven into all disciplines. For example, the pangenome project explores diversity in our genetic code. UC Santa Cruz also excels in community engagement, collaborating with communities to identify and work towards solutions for complex challenges in areas such as climate change and public health. None of these accomplishments would be possible without the contribution of truly amazing faculty members who are leaders in their respective fields.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Q: Under your leadership, UC Santa Cruz established the <a href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Innovation &amp; Business Engagement (IBE) Hub,</a> and the <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/cccr/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Center for Coastal Climate Resilience,</a> a $20 million initiative to address the impacts of climate change on our coastal communities in California. What other initiatives do you have in the pipeline?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The Office of Research recognizes the importance of fostering new ideas and collaborations, and we are starting to support this through internal funds. We are excited to invest in UC Santa Cruz research through another round of <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/ord/seed-initiatives.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seed funding and implementation.</a> We will allocate $5-6 million in funding in the next few weeks. We are also focused on facilitating interdisciplinary research, understanding the opportunities and barriers, and finding efficient ways to make it work. We are conducting a listening tour to gather perspectives and guidance to achieve this. Additionally, we will establish a VCR advisory committee consisting of associate deans to address complex research-related issues and provide guidance to our office.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Q: Anything else you'd like to share?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A:</strong> It's an interesting time at the federal level for research security and open data.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie&#8217;s research compared rates of business ownership before and after the pandemic with demographic data to show that Native-owned small businesses experienced a disproportionate decline of roughly 40% in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. His overall </span><a href="https://rfairlie.sites.ucsc.edu/recent-covid-19-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">findings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on racial inequities in business impacts have since informed a wide range of economic recovery programs for small businesses at the state and federal levels.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House pointed to Fairlie&#8217;s research as an example of the need to invest in Native-owned businesses and announced approval of the first 15 Tribal State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) awards for Tribal Governments funded by the American Rescue Plan, providing $73 million to 39 Tribal Governments to support Tribal enterprises and small business owners. These are the first-ever SSBCI awards directly to Tribal Governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie said he was glad to see policymakers paying close attention to economic data on Native American communities, and he hopes there will be increased research and visibility in this area in the future.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm especially excited about this, because very little research or policy focuses on Native Americans,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's great to see that my research helped in this regard.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="03fadcf8807270465bc10f6633d25448"><name>cccr-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC’s Center for Coastal Climate Resilience awards over $4.6 million to support California coastal projects </title><summary>The UCSC Center for Coastal Climate Resilience has awarded over $4.6 million in funding to 23 UC Santa Cruz research groups for pilot projects and implementation projects supporting efforts to fight climate change in coastal communities across California and beyond.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot funding initiative intends to foster previously unfunded research projects, collaborations, and creative works that address coastal climate-related impacts and solutions. Fifteen pilot projects were selected that will receive up to $100,000 each.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The implementation funding program supports projects that speak to the impacts to coastal communities from climate change, deliver clear outcomes and solutions, and engage partners to address the challenges from coastal climate change. Seven projects were selected for this program and will receive up to $500,000 each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through the Center for Coastal Climate Resilience, we were able to fund 23 projects that address a broad range of resilience challenges and will produce actionable outputs,&#8221; said John MacMillan, vice chancellor for research. &#8220;The pilot projects will jump-start innovative approaches, while the implementation projects will engage federal, state, community, and tribal partners to develop and scale solutions rooted in current work. We are excited about the potential of these projects to substantively advance resilience efforts in California and worldwide.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Robert Lund, professor and department chair of statistics at the UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering, collaborated on a new study that uses rigorous mathematical models and statistical methods and finds declining snow cover in many parts of the northern hemisphere over the last half century.<br/><br/>Understanding snow cover trends is important because of the role that snow plays in the global energy balance. Snow&#8217;s high albedo &#8211; the ability to reflect light &#8211; and insulating characteristics affects surface temperatures on a regional scale and thermal stability on a continent-wide scale. <br/><br/>In the <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/configurable/content/journals$002fhydr$002f24$002f6$002fJHM-D-22-0182.1.xml?t:ac=journals%24002fhydr%24002f24%24002f6%24002fJHM-D-22-0182.1.xml">new study</a> published in the Journal of Hydrometeorology, researchers analyzed snow cover data gathered from weekly satellite flyovers between 1967 (when satellites became more common) and 2021, which was divided into grid sections for analysis. Of the grids that researchers determined had reliable data, they found that snow cover is declining in nearly twice as many grids as it is advancing. <br/><br/>&#8220;In the Arctic regions, snow is going away more often than not &#8211; I think climatologists sort of suspected this,&#8221; Lund said. &#8220;But it's also going away at the southern boundaries of the continents.&#8221;<br/><br/>In a study that took about four years to complete, the researchers show that snow presence in the Arctic and southern latitudes of the Northern hemisphere is generally decreasing, while some areas such as Eastern Canada are seeing an increase in snow cover. This could be due to increasing temperatures in areas that are typically very cold but still below freezing, allowing the atmosphere to hold more water, which then falls as snow. <br/><br/>Lund believes this is the first truly dependable analysis of snow cover trends in the Northern hemisphere due to the rigor of the researchers&#8217; statistical methods. It is often challenging for non-statisticians to extract trends from this type of satellite data, which comes as a sequence of 0s or 1s to indicate if snow was present during a certain week. The researchers also had to take correlation into account when looking at trends, as the presence of snow cover one week greatly affects the likelihood of snow cover the following week. These two factors were taken into account with a Markov chain based model. Accurate uncertainty estimates of the trends could be computed from the model. The researchers found hundreds of grids where snow cover was declining with at least 97.5% certainty.<br/><br/>However, they also found that some of the satellite data gathered in mountainous regions was unreliable, showing no snow in the winter and several weeks of snow in the winter. This was likely due to a flaw in the algorithm that processed the satellite data to determine if snow was present or not.<br/><br/>&#8220;The reason this study took a lot of work is because the satellite data is so doggone poor,&#8221; Lund said. &#8220;Whatever the meteorologists did to estimate snow from the pictures in some of the mountainous regions just didn't work, so we had to take all the grids in the Northern hemisphere, and figure out whether the data was even trustworthy or not.&#8221;<br/><br/>By determining which satellite data is unreliable, this study can serve as a resource to the scientific community who also may want to evaluate this snow cover data for their research. <br/><br/>Lund collaborated on this study with UCSC Ph.D. candidate Jiajie Kong, Assistant Professor of Math and Statistics at the University of North Florida Yisu Jia, Professor of Meteorology and Climatology at Mississippi State University Jamie Dyer, Associate Professor of Statistics at Mississippi State University Jonathan Woody, and Professor of Statistics and Operations Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill J.

<p>We are disheartened by today's U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down Harvard and the University of North Carolina&#8217;s use of race as a factor in their admissions processes. Taken together with other federal and state actions across the country, today&#8217;s decision is not simply about admissions, but the latest attempt to dismantle evidence-based efforts aimed at reducing systemic barriers to opportunity experienced by historically marginalized populations, including communities of color. We agree with Justice Sotomayor's assessment that the court &#8220;cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter."</p>
<p>The court, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/22"><em>SFFA, Inc. v. Pres. and Fellows of Harvard College</em></a>, effectively overturned Grutter v. Bollinger, a 2003 decision that allowed public universities to consider race as one factor to achieve educational diversity. The decision today will thwart efforts by public and private institutions across the country to educate a diverse population of students. That is harmful to higher education and ultimately our nation. Students with varied experiences and perspectives enrich our communities, expand our awareness and foster students learning from each other. A diverse student body also strengthens institutions academically, as groups composed of people with diverse experiences and backgrounds have been shown to be more creative and innovative, assets valued by the companies that hire college graduates. Most importantly, the court&#8217;s ruling threatens to further disenfranchise members of certain groups historically excluded from higher education, limiting their opportunities to achieve their dreams and thrive.</p>
<p>The impact of this decision undoubtedly hits harder on institutions that have not already had to adapt to laws such as Proposition 209 in California. The University of California has more than a quarter-century of experience in evaluating prospective students in a race-neutral manner. When that referendum passed in 1996, the levels of underrepresented student groups tumbled. In the years since the passage of Proposition 209, the UC system and our campus specifically have implemented numerous measures within the law designed to create student cohorts as diverse as California itself. Our efforts include extensive outreach and recruitment programs directed at low-income students and students from families with little college experience, and adopting a student-assessment approach that allows evaluators to review students within the context of the opportunities they&#8217;ve had and the challenges they&#8217;ve faced. While we have not achieved pre-Proposition 209 levels on every front, we have seen significant progress. This is not easy work, but it is vital.</p>
<p>Access and opportunity for all are at the heart of a public university&#8217;s mission. While today&#8217;s court decision requires universities across the country to follow this new interpretation of the law, it also requires campus administrators, faculty, and staff to continue our efforts to expand outreach and opportunity in whatever ways we can. We proudly affirm that UC Santa Cruz will continue to be a leader in creating environments in which all students can grow and thrive.</p>

400;">Following the Supreme Court's ruling that struck down Harvard and the University of North Carolina&#8217;s use of race as a factor in their admissions processes, higher education institutions nationwide have been compelled to explore alternative strategies for promoting diverse incoming student bodies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California, Santa Cruz has long employed holistic methods to recruit, evaluate, and support applicants through the decision making process, aiming to enroll a student body that reflects the diverse population of California to prepare alumni to become global citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Access and opportunity for all are at the heart of a public university&#8217;s mission. While today&#8217;s court decision requires universities across the country to follow this new interpretation of the law, it also requires campus administrators, faculty, and staff to continue our efforts to expand outreach and opportunity in whatever ways we can,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive and Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer in a message to the campus community. &#8220;We proudly affirm that UC Santa Cruz will continue to be a leader in creating environments in which all students can grow and thrive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1988, the University of California system has employed a rigorous comprehensive review process for undergraduate applications, ensuring an equitable evaluation that considers multiple aspects of achievement and promise while acknowledging the unique contexts in which students have demonstrated their academic accomplishments.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996, the state of California was prohibited from granting preferential treatment to individuals or groups based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, education, or contracting. In the years since the passage of Proposition 209, UC campuses including Santa Cruz have worked diligently to enroll diverse populations, for instance by working to reduce systemic barriers to admission for first-generation and low-income students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on this foundation, UC Santa Cruz implemented a holistic review approach in 2012. Under this method, evaluators consider the entirety of each applicant, taking into account a wide range of information, achievements, and personal circumstances. By considering the achievements within the context of opportunities applicants have faced and an equitable assessment of their qualifications, the university aims to admit students with an eye toward their individual potential to contribute to the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Whittingham, the associate vice chancellor for enrollment management at UC Santa Cruz, emphasizes the importance of assessing achievement within the context of available opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"High-quality K-12 education is not equally available to all California students, and we are here to carefully assess student achievement and support student success," Whittingham said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional methods that assign fixed weights to specific factors, the holistic review approach considers each applicant's academic and personal achievements in conjunction with other relevant qualifications. The evaluators aim to create a comprehensive understanding of each individual's unique circumstances and potential, taking into consideration the resources and opportunities available to them. This approach acknowledges the multifaceted nature of student achievements and ensures a fair and inclusive evaluation process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is committed to the mission of fostering equity, diversity and promoting excellence in higher education. The use of holistic application review reflects the campus's dedication to admitting a diverse student body that will thrive and contribute to its vibrant academic community.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to recruit, enroll and graduate a student body that is as diverse as the population of California,&#8221; Whittingham said. &#8220;We want students to be able to see themselves on our campus and be prepared to make the world a better place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz's dedication to equity, diversity, inclusion and academic excellence is evident in its holistic review process and collaborative approach. By prioritizing access and opportunity, the campus serves as a model for universities seeking to enroll and serve a wide array of students from groups that have been historically excluded from higher education.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0d9a769c8072704638d2873fbcc85c7f"><name>supreme-court-loan-forgiveness</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Statement on Supreme Court decision on Biden’s student loan forgiveness</title><summary>Today’s Supreme Court ruling rejecting President Biden’s plan to forgive more than $400 billion in student loan debt is deeply disappointing to the 26 million borrowers who stood to benefit — thousands of Banana Slug alumni certainly among them.</summary><start-date>1688108400000</start-date><display-name>Loan forgiveness</display-name><path>/2023/06/supreme-court-loan-forgiveness</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/06/supreme-court-loan-forgiveness</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1688150374026</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1688150822197</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Today&#8217;s Supreme Court ruling rejecting President Biden&#8217;s plan to forgive more than $400 billion in student loan debt is deeply disappointing to the 26 million borrowers who stood to benefit &#8212; thousands of Banana Slug alumni certainly among them.

<p>The relief plan would have especially benefited first-generation college graduates and those from low-income backgrounds, who are more likely to take on debt to complete their education. UC Santa Cruz is committed to keeping the cost of a degree as low as possible, providing financial-aid packages to new admits before any loans are taken and actively seeking resources to increase available scholarships and fellowships.</p>
<p>Sixty-one percent of UC&#8217;s California resident undergraduates complete their degrees without any student-loan debt, while 54 percent have their tuition fully covered by financial aid. UCSC students and alumni are encouraged to consider all the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans">loan-repayment options the Department of Education has developed</a> for borrowers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout the closure, she kept people thinking of us, supporting us and ultimately kept us from closing permanently,&#8221; said Executive Director Jonathan Hicken.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, the center was closed for 19 months and the staff reduced by half. Bieser, who was board president at the time, stepped up to lead the volunteers. She figured out how to open the store outside so they could generate revenue, and then worked with the staff and other volunteers to put together the center&#8217;s first outdoor offerings through the new Seymour Center Outdoors program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had about 20 to 30 dedicated volunteers that would come every Saturday,&#8221; Bieser said. &#8220;We&#8217;d haul tables out, haul exhibits out, stand out there in the cold and in the wind and talk to whoever walked by. We would get on average 200 visitors every Saturday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than 50 years, the Volunteer Center has been the county&#8217;s hub for volunteering. They partner with government agencies, non-profits, and social service groups, including UC Santa Cruz, to recruit volunteers to help with major disaster relief and place program volunteers across the county.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Volunteers are the heart of Santa Cruz County,&#8221; said Leslie Lee, Director of Community Engagement. &#8220;It is volunteers who transform our community and make it the great place that it is.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, Bieser puts in more than 100 hours at the Seymour Center each month. Compare that to the average volunteer that provides 104 hours of service per year. She has volunteered 648 hours in the past six months and nearly 6,000 hours during her 12 years. She also currently volunteers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium and used to spend every Monday at The Marine Mammal Center, in Moss Landing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her contributions have impacted close to a million people since she started volunteering here, either directly or indirectly,&#8221; said Hicken. &#8220;Including, I would estimate, about 75,000 students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bieser has worked in every area of the center, including as a docent, exhibit guide, school instructor for visiting school classroom groups, president of the board, and, most recently, on the aquarium team helping care for the live animals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing she likes the most is sharing her love of the ocean and science, especially with children. &#8220;Climate change is real and the ocean drives the whole thing,&#8221; said Bieser. &#8220;Using an iPhone is intuitive to kids. Wouldn&#8217;t it be something if taking care of the ocean was just as intuitive?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year, the </span><a href="https://scvolunteercenter.org/be-the-difference-award"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be the Difference Award</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recognizes the top volunteers - businesses, groups and individuals - who transform the Santa Cruz community through volunteerism. This year, five awardees were selected from 46 nominations. Along with Bieser, the honorees include: Isaiah Williams, Hospice of Santa Cruz County Volunteer, Individual Honoree; Hopes Closet, Nonprofit Honoree; Boulder Creek Fire Protection District, Group Honoree; 1440 Multiversity, Business Honoree.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Community Relations office has long partnered with the Volunteer Center on the annual awards reviewing nominations and applications along with other community leaders to identify individuals who exemplify the spirit of volunteerism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This year for the first time, we sponsored the Volunteer Center for April, which is Volunteer Month,&#8221; Associate Director of Community Relations Audries Blake explained. &#8220;That allowed us an opportunity to really highlight our appreciation for all of the volunteers that stepped up through the floods.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake is working to grow UCSC&#8217;s presence through events such as the annual Downtown Day and the beach cleanup event held earlier this year. Events like these &#8220;model the importance of what we do and who we are as a community.&#8221; Blake and her co-workers also look to identify additional ways UCSC can support the greater Santa Cruz area, including businesses and organizations, many of which were started by alumni.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in volunteering, the Volunteer Center has a database of 150 active opportunities. You can also meet with Volunteer Match Services to find something that fits your interests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bieser wants to remind UCSC students that they can get into the Seymour Marine Discovery Center by showing their Cruz ID, and that there are also internships and paid positions available to UCSC students.&#160;</span></p>

<p>We are dismayed to see the U.S. Supreme Court chipping away at the legal protections and freedoms of same-sex couples and people in additional protected classes. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/22"><em>303 Creative v. Elenis</em></a>, the court ruled in favor of a designer who did not want to create wedding websites for gay couples, citing her religious beliefs.</p>
<p>This opinion undermines state public-accommodation laws, which require businesses to offer equal access to everyone, regardless of protected characteristics including sexual orientation. With the court&#8217;s decision, such laws are now enforceable only to the extent they do not violate the First Amendment rights of individuals. Requiring business owners to create and publish messages concerning same-sex marriage, if the business owner disagrees with it, is such a violation.</p>
<p>We continue to live in an era of othering, with some individuals not treated with the same respect and protection as others, depending on who they love. This decision, arriving at the conclusion of Pride Month, is all that more painful and continues to show that institutionalized discrimination continues to be sanctioned in the U.S. As individuals, as allies and as a community committed to social justice, we cannot become complacent as members of our own community must endure discrimination. Significant actions are being taken across the country to oppress LGBTQIA people, some going as far as to attempt to erase LGBTQIA history and existence. When a community&#8217;s existence and rights must be justified and re-justified by the court, its members are not equal. Their rights will always be in question, they will face continued discrimination, and they will live with the threat that their rights can be taken away. When that is the case, equal rights do not exist. We remain in solidarity with all members of our community who continue to have to fight to secure the rights, freedoms, and the sense of belonging that many of us all take for granted.</p>
<p>We encourage those in need to reach out for support. <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> provides assistance for students. Our <a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a> offers counseling and support to employees. The <a href="https://queer.ucsc.edu">Lionel Cant&#250; Queer Center</a> is another place where our campus community can find support and resources. <a href="https://www.eqca.org">Equality California</a> is another resource.</p>
<p>We will continue to work hard to make our campus community a place of belonging and inclusion while continuing to push for true equal rights in our broader society.</p>
