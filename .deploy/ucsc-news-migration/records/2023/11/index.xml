</article-subhead><article-text><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alumni Association at UC Santa Cruz is proud to present this year&#8217;s honorees of the UCSC Alumni Awards. These awards recognize and honor alumni who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievements, made distinct contributions to society, provided impactful contributions to UCSC, and who have embodied the values and spirit of the university.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his service to his community and the public, Abel Pineda received the Outstanding Recent Alumni Award on Oct. 27, 2023.&#160;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abel Pineda was very intentional in choosing to attend UC Santa Cruz and what he planned to do after graduation:&#160; To return home to serve the City of San Pablo where he was born and raised. Pineda came to UCSC with the purpose of gaining the knowledge and skills he needed to better understand the issues facing his community and how to address them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first in his family to go to college, Pineda graduated from UCSC in 2014 with a B.A. in sociology. Five years later, he became the youngest person ever elected to the San Pablo City Council, and in 2022 became the youngest ever elected as the city&#8217;s mayor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pineda&#8217;s dedication to public service was profoundly influenced when he lost his best friend to gang violence while still in high school. He became determined to make radical changes in his community.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As somebody that was born and raised in San Pablo, I got a chance to see our community go through so much. I knew that we deserved better, that we deserved a better shot at having complete lives, having great jobs, feeling safe in our schools and community, and having access to healthcare resources and programs. I look at it through that lens because I grew up in this community. It's very personal to me.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recognition of his dedication and service, UCSC awarded Pineda with the first-ever Outstanding Recent Alumni Award on Oct. 27.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a recognition that means a lot to me personally because it not only represents the hard work and sacrifices that I've made to obtain a higher education, but also the support and encouragement that I've received by my mentors, colleagues, and the community that I serve,&#8221; Pineda said. &#8220;So I really appreciate and value this so much, because it's also a testament of the power of education, public service, and making a positive impact on people's lives.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Making meaningful change</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s difficult for Pineda to pinpoint the policies and programs that he is most proud of spearheading&#8212;especially because there are dozens of them. Pineda emphasizes that he is intentional about the issues he aims to address in San Pablo and combats the issues directly affecting his community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When it comes to health, when it comes to education, when it comes to housing, all these issues are very much top of mind for me. They're all super important amongst others. In my situation and in my community, while we may not have all the solutions or the funding to address all these issues immediately, we're all working on a plan both short term and long term to try to meet the needs of our residents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key issues at the forefront of Pineda&#8217;s agenda is educational accessibility, specifically when it comes to higher education. In 2023, Pineda helped establish the San Pablo Scholarship, a three-year pilot program which aims to financially support individuals on their journey to pursue higher education or trade school. Pineda is actively working on a ballot measure to create long term funding for the scholarship to support San Pablo residents of any age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's a lot of opportunities there,&#8221; Pineda emphasizes. &#8220;I want to make sure that people have all the options on the table so that they can be qualified and prepared to take these roles on. When it comes to long term funding, I don't want it to be limited to just recent high school graduates, I want anyone living in the city of San Pablo to have this opportunity to have the support, to have these resources, and to be able to pursue their passions.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to strengthening accessibility to higher education in his community, Pineda was adamant about advocating for his constituents during the COVID-19 pandemic and instilled an eviction and rent increase moratorium in the city. Pineda said the moratorium prevented displacement during a vulnerable time for many people. More recently, he has worked to create a rental registry requiring landlords to report their properties to the city. In turn, the city will be able to ensure landlords are in compliance with state mandates and prevent severe rental hikes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pineda&#8217;s work to support education and rental security only scratches the surface of policies and programs he&#8217;s spearheaded and supported since being elected in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His advice for students looking to pursue a career in public service: It doesn&#8217;t matter how young or old you are, don&#8217;t limit yourself because you don&#8217;t have the experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I've come across people that will negate themselves the opportunity to pursue a position of working for an elected official or running for office themselves because they say &#8216;I don't have the background or I don't have the experience necessary for me to even be considered.&#8217;At every single person's time in a career, it was their first day too. No one was born with all the experience or knowledge.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a stark advocate for the residents of San Pablo, Pineda is positioned to leave a legacy of dedication and passion in his community and beyond.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitworth played the role of Lear for the first time at the Santa Cruz Shakespeare Festival in the summer of 2023.&#160; In this lecture, he discusses his past relationship with the play, his approach to the leading role and compares it with other Shakespearean leads he has played.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;King Lear is forced to undergo a redefinition of himself under new and strange circumstances.&#8221; Whitworth says. &#8220;This is something I think that we can all relate to because it doesn't just happen in retirement; it happens if we lose a job, lose a friend, lose a partner. Who are we when our relationship with the world is suddenly and radically altered?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think Shakespeare is always fascinated by how we shape shift from one kind of person to another,&#8221; Whitworth says. &#8220;That's his territory: how we negotiate the great forces that act upon our lives. How do we adapt? What choices do we make? How do we come to terms with our circumstances?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitworth hopes the lecture will communicate something of his continuing fascination and engagement with the theater. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is no substitute for it,&#8221; he emphasizes. &#8220;No film can ever replicate what Shakespeare called &#8216;the cunning of the scene.' His experiments with theater continued throughout his career and King Lear is one of his boldest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The lecture will take place at the <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4733&amp;cid=11227">Music Recital Hall on November 15th at 7 pm</a>. The event is free and open to the public.&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitworth encourages attendees to read the beginning of the play through King Lear&#8217;s first exit, and Edmund&#8217;s soliloquy (which immediately follows this first scene) before attending the lecture. He asks attendees to read the scene carefully, imagine they are Lear and answer the following question: What is King Lear&#8217;s plan for his kingdom as he announces his retirement?</span></p>
<h3><strong>Paul Whitworth</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitworth&#8217;s passion for theater was ignited at the age of 10 at boarding school in England, persisting through his postgraduate years at Oxford University. He left Oxford to join the renowned Royal Shakespeare Company.&#160; He has performed and directed professionally in many theaters in England and the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitworth&#8217;s association with UC Santa Cruz began in 1984 when Shakespeare Santa Cruz invited him to play Prince Hal in their production of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry IV, Part I</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As professor of Theater Arts at UCSC and former artistic director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, Whitworth has sought to promote a creative exchange between scholarship and performance.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="87dce89880727046661c5bd07597477c"><name>alexis-jackson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumna Alexis Jackson takes the lessons from the Pacific Coast near UCSC to the environmental policy tables of California</title><start-date>1699257600000</start-date><display-name>alexis-jackson</display-name><path>/2023/11/alexis-jackson</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/alexis-jackson</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1698791483520</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1698791483520</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Coastal Science and Policy</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Grace Stetson</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/alexis-jackson-lead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/alexis-jackson-lead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexis-jackson-lead.jpg</name><display-name>alexis-jackson-lead.jpg</display-name><file-size>68274</file-size><width>480</width><height>480</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/alexis-jackson-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/alexis-jackson-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexis-jackson-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alexis-jackson-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16088</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Alexis Jackson (Ph.D. &#8217;14, ecology and evolutionary biology)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexis Jackson is coming up on an anniversary in her professional life.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/alexis-jackson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 2014 Ph.D. graduate of </span><a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Ecology and Evolutionary Biology program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has been with The Nature Conservancy for nearly seven years, and is currently the California Chapter&#8217;s Ocean Policy and Plastics Lead based out of San Francisco. Looking back to her time at UCSC from 2008 to 2014 during her master&#8217;s and doctoral work, Jackson reflects on how those experiences helped her to get to this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she first arrived at UCSC, the Oakland native had just graduated from Yale University, where she received her B.S. in ecology and evolutionary biology. Returning to the West Coast from Connecticut, she was grateful to have the Pacific Ocean mere steps away from campus, all while enjoying the bounty of educational opportunities on her way to a doctorate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was amazing to be by the coast, but it was also incredible to have the Marine Lab [the Seymour Marine Discovery Center], which is absolutely breathtaking,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, moving from a larger city to a town of just 45 percent of New Haven&#8217;s population, Jackson had to adjust to the smaller town dynamics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For me, it was important to find a city that was liberal and open-minded&#8212;I&#8217;m a city person, and Santa Cruz is very small,&#8221; she said, also noting the lack of diversity among its population. &#8220;It took some time and concerted effort to find my place here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first few years, Jackson would travel back and forth between Santa Cruz and Oakland to partake in her hometown&#8217;s larger communities of color, dance and arts communities, and the like. Over time, she was able to find more folks in Santa Cruz that offered up those experiences, which helped her to balance her place in the community both inside the lab and out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How you nurture the other aspects of your personality and individual being are equally important to your studies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When I found the dance community here, I started to feel at home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On campus, Jackson was a member of </span><a href="https://bernardi.eeb.ucsc.edu/people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Giacomo Bernardi&#8217;s Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing on the population genetics of fishes with her fellow doctoral candidates. Under his leadership, she saw the vast impact of the lab&#8217;s work through the PANGAS project, in which oceanographers, geneticists and ecologists gathered information on commercially important species in Baja California, which led to more data to guide the development of fishery management plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dr. Bernardi&#8217;s Lab stuck out to me because he was the intersection of doing applied research and making sure that that research was entering spaces where it could be impactful, to have fishery managers making decisions,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through both taking part in and witnessing this work, Jackson saw the work through &#8220;the greater lens&#8221; of the science&#8217;s value, and how science could be packaged to inform management decisions. That led her to work with faculty members in those labs, including Bernardi, to see the impact of the work on the greater conversations and policy aims surrounding the conservation efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She further worked with other committee members that were from outside of Santa Cruz, which Jackson believes made her work and her professional trajectory all the better: &#8220;I think the collaborative space is really key for impactful conversation&#8212;one organization or institution cannot move the needle on any given issue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She continued: &#8220;It&#8217;s how we layer our skill sets and strengths to really amplify impact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she approached the completion of her academic work, Jackson evaluated her next steps. She had a strong resume, had received grants, and had a good network with others in the field. She considered a postdoctoral track at first, but soon decided that entering the policy and management space may be a better decision for how her work can make an impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I&#8217;m going to be an impactful researcher, I need to actually know what it&#8217;s like to be on the other side, for the people receiving this information,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson received a one-year Knauss Marine Policy Fellowship with the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Washington, D.C., and then joined the team full-time as a Fishery Management Specialist. From there, she joined The Pew Charitable Trusts as a senior associate focused on international ocean policy. She returned to the West Coast in 2017 to join The Nature Conservancy, where she&#8217;s been ever since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The fellowship gave me a concrete way to transition into that new sector, and helped me to come in with an established network that was credible and to open doors,&#8221; she said. &#8220;While we had some sense as grad students of the importance of networking, I really learned from my time in D.C. that your work can be important outright&#8212;but if it&#8217;s not in the places and with the people that matter, it&#8217;s not as impactful as we hope.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At The Nature Conservancy, Jackson has combined her skill sets from UCSC, NOAA and Pew to engage her existing networks for TNC&#8217;s continued work on ensuring best available science is integrated into management and policies impacting coastal and marine ecosystems off California. Her thoughtful engagement with key decision-makers and stakeholders on a range of issues from fisheries to habitat restoration and plastic pollution is what led to her current role in overseeing the ocean policy portfolio for the California Oceans program, as well as a recent gubernatorial appointment to the California Ocean Protection Council.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the lead, she oversees an interdisciplinary team focusing on policy research and strategic planning toward policies that reduce plastic pollution, advance sustainable fisheries management and promote island resilience and ocean recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she has not had many touchpoints with UCSC since graduating in 2014, Jackson still sees some names of her former professors and fellow cohort members pop up in her work and in her networks. Additionally, now residing in Oakland, she keeps up with her mentors from UCSC and tries to visit the area at least once a year, including a 10-year reunion with her Ph.D. advisor and labmates earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It still counts for a lot to hear from them, that they&#8217;re proud of me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Everyone is progressing in exciting and different ways, but the skillsets we gained and the camaraderie we had, that&#8217;s still a strong community for us.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b84e2ac807270460014b40418fff170"><name>preston-choi</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Seeing “One Too Many Racist Musicals” is What Led Preston Choi to be a Playwright</title><summary>Rebecca Wear, professor of Performance, Play and Design, will direct the student production of "You'll Get Used to It" at UC Santa Cruz on Nov. 3-12, 2023.</summary><start-date>1698822000000</start-date><path>/2023/11/preston-choi</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/preston-choi</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1698852823706</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1698852870748</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Wilson</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/you-will-get-used-to-it.png</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/you-will-get-used-to-it.png</link><site>news</site><name>you-will-get-used-to-it.png</name><display-name>you-will-get-used-to-it.png</display-name><file-size>52698</file-size><width>542</width><height>360</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/you-will-get-used-to-it1.png</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/you-will-get-used-to-it1.png</link><site>news</site><name>you-will-get-used-to-it1.png</name><display-name>you-will-get-used-to-it.png</display-name><file-size>10364</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/rebecca-wear.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/rebecca-wear.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>rebecca-wear.jpeg</name><display-name>rebecca-wear.jpeg</display-name><file-size>33147</file-size><width>500</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Rebecca Wear, professor of Performance, Play and Design.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>His sardonic new play You Will Get Used It Examines Workplace Culture </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playwright Preston Choi met </span><a href="https://ppd.ucsc.edu/people/rebecca-wear"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Wear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a professor in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Department of Performance, Play, and Design, at San Diego&#8217;s Cygnet Theatre, where she was directing his friend&#8217;s play. In her time there, Wear saw a reading of Choi&#8217;s new play, </span><a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/you-will-get-used-it"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Will Get Used to It</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a work satire with people in cubicles and liquid oozing out of the walls, and she told him she wanted to work with him. Choi said an enthusiastic yes. Now, Wear will direct the student production at UC Santa Cruz Nov. 3-12, 2023.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She&#8217;s an incredibly smart director who&#8217;s able to think about a play on both a large scale with the flow and story elements but also the small scale of the moment-to-moment things with actors and performances,&#8221; Choi said. &#8220;There&#8217;s also a wonderful practicality about how she approaches things. Sometimes I can get a little heady or conceptual, and she&#8217;ll grab me and say, &#8216;Okay, but what&#8217;s actually happening?&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choi&#8217;s plays include </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Is Not A True Story</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which reimagines Madame Butterfly and Miss Saigon, unraveling &#8220;the history of Orientalist art, theater, and the danger of fiction becoming reality.&#8221; Doing theater growing up and seeing &#8220;one too many racist musicals&#8221; is what led Choi to be a playwright whose work deals with &#8220;social science fiction, Asian-American/mixed race/queer lives, and the horror of being alive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting his MFA in Playwriting at UC San Diego, Choi got a BS in Theater at Northwestern University in Chicago, and he says being in the city had a big impact on him.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chicago has so much new theater, and I was like, &#8216;Oh, you can actually make the stories you want to see,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it was sort of spite for how theater had hurt me, but also love for what it could possibly do [that led to becoming a playwright].&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While living in Chicago, he went to storefront theaters and started writing skits with friends, which he loved. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those days were really exciting, where it's like, we had nothing to risk because we had no investors,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We had no board of directors we had to go back to &#8212; it was just each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choi says the play that will be performed at UC Santa Cruz, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Will Get Used to It</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though dark, is also funny.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For how grim it is, it is a comedy, and it is about a workplace,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think as absurd as the people are, there is, I think, an identifiable sort of humanity inside of all of them. I think that's something where you can see yourself reflected, and then the reflection sort of gets more twisted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for the play came when he was a temp worker in Chicago doing third party health insurance data accounting. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every year they take one or two people from the temps to join their fold,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought what would it be like to actually be like to be one of those people?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choi will be coming up to Santa Cruz from Los Angeles Nov. 2-4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, doing a workshop with the students and a talk back. He looks forward to seeing the play performed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just seeing how they interact with the script, beyond how they move, how does it flow, how are these images that have been written down actually manifested?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The language and visuals often go hand and hand, and sometimes they get fantastical. So how do you solve those problems for the stage? I'm always excited to see how teams come together to do that. Also just having an audience to see how the jokes work. Do they get quiet at moments? Are they paying attention, or are they drifting off? I usually like to stay in a far back corner and observe everything from there.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b8fd7d9807270460014b4047f9fa936"><name>richland-atomic-bomb</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Irene Lusztig’s Film Richland Explores a Town Grappling with its Ties to the Atomic Bomb</title><summary>Irene Lusztig's latest film, Richland, tells the story of the town of the same name.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of towns she went to was Richland, in Eastern Washington to meet Trisha Pritikin, who chose as her backdrop for reading her letter a huge logo of a mushroom cloud that covered the back wall of the high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s not the only sign of the town&#8217;s pride in its nuclear history &#8212; the high school sports teams are the Bombers, there&#8217;s a Proton Lane, and Richland celebrates an annual Atomic Frontier Day Parade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The town was established in 1943 to provide housing for workers who manufactured plutonium at the nearby Hanford Nuclear Site for the &#8220;Fat Man&#8221; bomb the U.S. dropped on Nagasaki in World War II.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lusztig&#8217;s latest documentary, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richland</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tells the story of the town. It opened at Tribeca and at the prestigious International Documentary Festival Amsterdam, it was selected to be part of the program "Signed," (described as "The latest films by the most interesting contemporary filmmakers whose filmographies we highly appreciate, and for whose work we wait with excitement.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lusztig wanted to know how people grappled with Richland&#8217;s history. Pritikin, whose father died of cancer and has had health problems herself, is an anti-nuclear activist she met, but many people she talked to like living in the town, and many of the next generation now work in nuclear clean-up.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was extremely well funded with high paying jobs because it was important government work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was built as a very idyllic suburban community for workers &#8212; the public library is beautiful, and the parks are super nicely maintained. It&#8217;s a very pleasant community and people have wonderful childhood memories of growing up there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She dug into the town&#8217;s archives, something she has done since making her first movie, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconstruction</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when she went to Romania to investigate the history of her grandmother who robbed a bank there. The Romanian government had made a propaganda film about it where Lusztig&#8217;s grandmother, along with others involved, were forced to reenact the crime. Lusztig spent a lot of time in the archives looking for that film and she fell in love with archival films and how they can be used.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same way she asked the people in Sisterhood to read letters to Ms. Magazine out loud, in this movie, Lusztig asked some participants to read from a book of poems, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plume</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, written by a Richland native, Kathleen Flenniken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lusztig often invites people who are in her movies to watch it at different stages. She likes her work to be collaborative, wanting to build community and shift the balance of power.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every time a camera is there, there is some kind of performance. So just calling it a performance and making it performative is a way of, I think, making a more consensual space,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It feels like an invitation to make something together with someone rather than just pointing a camera at them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What she wanted to get at with the film was not only the environmental fallout for the town, but how we all ignore things we don&#8217;t want to think too much about.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of us live with a lot of denial every day, like ordering things from Amazon and not thinking about climate change,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s that kind of phenomenon of having a blind spot or living with some kind of denial or just not wanting to look at the whole of something that's really difficult to look at. That&#8217;s not specific to Richland.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="910c593d80727046364eb0485bee3d99"><name>uncertainty-learning</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>True or false?

Yet, with the wide breadth of sometimes unreliable information across the Internet, it can be difficult to decipher fact from fiction.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s one of the reasons why UC Santa Cruz postdoctoral scholar Karen Arcos set out to determine how the process of guessing whether information is true or not might affect learning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcos and her two co-authors, Assistant Professor of Psychology Hannah Hausman and Department Chair of Psychology Benjamin Storm, published their findings recently with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an article titled </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17470218231206813"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you sure?: Examining the Potential Benefits of Truth-Checking as a Learning Activity.&#8221;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper follows a series of three experiments, in which the authors provided participants with 50 historical statements, ranging from U.S. history to geography to wartime facts to the Civil Rights movement and beyond. Some participants were shown exclusively true statements&#8212;and were told that they were true&#8212;and other participants were offered a mix of true and false statements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All participants were later tested to see how well they remembered the true statements presented during the experiment and to see how well they could differentiate false and true statements.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The participants who were presented with some false information during the experiment were either told each statement&#8217;s accuracy in advance or were asked to guess it prior to receiving feedback that revealed which statements were true and which were false, a tactic that the team calls &#8220;truth-checking.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth-checking, Arcos explained, involves an individual guessing or predicting if a statement is true without knowing for sure if it is or not. The research team thought that truth-checking might increase a participant&#8217;s attention to a statement they had yet to learn, as well as their curiosity for the truth, and thus help them to remember the statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea behind the work is that, perhaps, by being able to think through the information more carefully, you&#8217;ll be able to remember it, as opposed to just reading information and assuming that it&#8217;s true from the get-go,&#8221; said Arcos, who finished her postdoctoral fellowship in early October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Storm, who oversaw Arcos&#8217;s experiments as part of </span><a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/&#126;bcstorm/research.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the UCSC Memory Laboratory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has focused the majority of his career on human memory, namely the causes and consequences of forgetting. With this study, Arcos built upon Storm&#8217;s previous work, making the learning process a bit more challenging, in order to engage in cognitive processes that allow for participants to better remember facts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some prior research in the field has shown that activities that create pauses to reflect on learning material&#8212;or that space out the timing of information gathering&#8212;can help learners to retain information more than the standard study tactic of simply re-reading information. But on the other hand, research on misinformation has shown how beliefs built on false information can become deeply entrenched, even after the falsities are revealed. Arcos and her co-authors wanted to explore how truth-checking might interact with both of these dynamics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC team&#8217;s findings showed that, under some conditions, the "truth checking" process seemed to enhance learning of true information, but it was not a time-efficient means of learning and also led to a greater likelihood of thinking false information was true. These findings suggest that the costs of truth-checking in learning may outweigh any benefits. The team was surprised there wasn&#8217;t a larger positive impact on learning from the addition of truth-checking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We thought this would really help students remember the information&#8212;when you have to make a decision of whether something&#8217;s true or not, it forces you to really judge the material,&#8221; Storm said. &#8220;But we didn&#8217;t find much of a benefit there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcos believes there&#8217;s potential for future research looking more into prior knowledge exposure and truth-checking to offer new insights on how the process works and how it might affect learning in our age of increasing uncertainty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why might people be biased to just guess information as true,&#8221; she asked. &#8220;How can we get them to think more carefully about the statements that they&#8217;re reading? Science is not, &#8216;it&#8217;s definitely this, or it&#8217;s definitely that,&#8217;; it&#8217;s messier than that.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9685c85a8072704637945e9133ddf68b"><name>jim-lapsley-alumni-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> UCSC Alumnus Jim Lapsley helps build a future for Crown College </title><summary>Pioneer alumnus Jim Lapsley, who was recognized with the Fiat Lux Award for his contributions to the Crown College Endowment, ruminates on his fundraising efforts and shares highlights from his life including his Crown experiences. &#13;

These awards recognize and honor alumni who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievements, made distinct contributions to society, provided impactful contributions to UCSC, and who have embodied the values and spirit of the university.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his contributions, dedication, and efforts to support Crown College, Jim Lapsley </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Crown &#8217;71, history)</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">received the Fiat Lux Award on Oct. 27, 2023</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside his fellow Crown College alumni volunteers, Susan Nerton and Lisa Rose, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Lapsley received the 2023 Fiat Lux Award for the remarkable feat of raising $1 million for the Crown College endowment&#8212;and helped many alumni feel more connected to the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">74-year-old Lapsley, who spent much time and energy raising money and awareness, is honored and humbled to receive this award. His efforts were driven by many factors, including wanting to help current students. &#8220;As JFK once said, &#8216;To those whom much is given, much is expected.&#8217; We were given an extraordinary educational experience,&#8221; says Lapsley. Another motivation: he believes in the College system at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I (we) had the opportunity to hear Provost Camps&#8217; vision of strengthening the Crown community and realized he (and future Provosts) needed long-term funding to turn this vision into reality,&#8221; Lapsley said. &#8220;The money will help provosts design and pay for courses and other activities that provide applied experience for students and enhance Crown&#8217;s community identity.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lapsley helped plan activities&#8212;including folk dancing&#8212;for the 2022 Crown College 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reunion for the 1968-1972 classes. When he was a student, folk dancing was a popular activity on Fridays at the Fieldhouse. The reunion successfully fulfilled two purposes: to gather old friends and classmates and to rekindle and strengthen emotional ties with Crown College, which ultimately became the basis for post-reunion fundraising.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the reunion, Lapsley personally called dozens of alumni about the endowment fundraising campaign. Although it was challenging to ask for money, he was successful and enjoyed catching up with people. &#8220;During the Reunion, I acted as a host and didn&#8217;t get as much one-on-one time with my fellow alumni as I would have liked.&#8221; He had long phone conversations and exchanged stories. &#8220;That opportunity for renewed connection was very meaningful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crown College Provost Manel Camps says he is grateful for Jim Lapsley&#8217;s support over the years and emphasizes the time and dedication that went into executing the Crown College 50th Reunion in 2022 and the Endowment Fundraising Campaign alongside Su Nerton and Lisa Rose.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#8220;Jim is an amazing leader,&#8221; says Provost Camps. &#8220;His vision for a college that plays a central role in our students&#8217; education resonated loud and clear with his peers. He earned a profound respect through his work organizing our reunion and fundraising to double Crown&#8217;s endowment. Crown is in a different place now. It has substantially more resources to fulfill its mission, and also has a large network of alumni who have reconnected to Crown and shown they can be a real presence in our current students&#8217; experience.&#8221;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Roots of the Campaign</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early 2000s, two informal Crown College reunions organized by Jim and his friends drew about 40 Crown alumni and resulted in the reconnection of Su, Lisa, and Jim. In 2017 Lapsley was interviewed for a video celebrating the 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary of Crown&#8217;s opening; he met Provost Camps.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When he told me there was a need to revamp the Crown Library, I naturally turned to the group that had attended our informal reunions.&#8221; During this process, Lapsley became close with Nerton and Rose; they led fundraising for the library and Fireside Lounge to create enhanced study spaces. The trio continues supporting students today as Crown Provost&#8217;s Advising Committee members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Su and Lisa and I each have particular strengths. Each thinks the other two are doing all the work,&#8221; says Lapsley, who hopes other colleges and groups can use their work as a model. &#8220;We think a 50-year celebration is a good idea&#8230;it brings people back to their beginnings and can result in financial support.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Life as a Student</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lapsley has fond memories; these include attending Crown College Nights and going up the coast to sit out on rocky points waiting to get soaked by waves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He met his wife Carol in his second year (her first) at Crown while working in the dish room. &#8220;Sometimes when work was slow, I&#8217;d go to the front and encourage people to separate utensils from plates. When Carol did, I said &#8216;thank you&#8217; in Russian, and she replied &#8216;you&#8217;re welcome&#8217; in Russian.&#160; Turns out we had both studied Russian in high school.&#8221; They were married in a meadow above the Quarry in 1971.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally a Politics major, planning to be a lawyer, he switched to history as a junior. He appreciated his talented professors, Dr. Peter Kenez (Russian history) and the late Dr. Laurence Veysey (American intellectual history) who were very influential.&#160; Kenez and Lapsley occasionally meet for coffee when Lapsley visits Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><strong>Graduate education and beyond&#160;&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lapsley earned a Ph.D. in American history from UC Davis, with his dissertation </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bottled Poetry</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by UC Press. Lapsley says his dissertation focused on agricultural and economic history, specifically the emergence of a fine wine market in the U.S. and the dominant role of Napa Valley producers in the development of that market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1978 he joined UC Davis University Extension as a continuing education specialist and created and led the Extension&#8217;s Agriculture and the Environment Department. He worked as Department Chair until retiring in 2009. He started a small winery in 1980, and in 1991 became an Adjunct Associate Professor with the Department of Viticulture and Enology. He taught a three-week-long wine business summer course for 15 years and rotated with other faculty teaching the introductory course. &#8220;After I retired, an Agricultural Economist colleague asked me to return to work part-time at the California Agricultural Issues Center, where I spent 12 years at 30% time researching wine and grape history and economics. I&#8217;m now completely retired and writing a history of R.B. Blowers, the first successful commercial producer of raisins in California, and his role in the creation of intensive, irrigated fruit culture from 1854-1894.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Carol live in Woodland with a Siamese cat and a Golden Doodle. Their son Jakob, a nurse and an American College of Surgeons administrator, lives in Chicago. Their daughter, Grace, a high school English teacher, lives in Sacramento with her husband Jason and children Sebastian and Miranda.&#160; &#8220;Being part of our grandchildren&#8217;s lives is very special.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Final Words</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he has advice for students, Lapsley replies: &#8220;Learn how to learn and keep learning.&#160; The world changes quickly and you need to adapt.&#8221; His message to alumni: &#8220;We were given an incredible educational opportunity. It is time to give back.&#8221;</span></p>

These awards recognize and honor alumni who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievements, made distinct contributions to society, provided impactful contributions to UCSC, and who have embodied the values and spirit of the university.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her dedication to causes amplifying social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion, Bettina Aptheker </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">received the Ethos Award on Oct. 27, 2023.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Bettina Aptheker </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Ph.D. &#8217;83, history of consciousness) is many things: a Distinguished Professor Emerita of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Feminist Studies Department, an author, civil rights and anti-war activist, and a trailblazer in radical teachings.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scholar-activist, Aptheker co-led the Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley 1964-65, was a leader of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam and co-led the National United Committee to Free Angela Davis (1970-1972) that organized a transnational movement for her freedom. She was also an avid supporter of the LGBT movement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recognition of Aptheker&#8217;s deep and abiding commitment to causes of social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion, she was awarded the UCSC Ethos Award.&#160;</span></p>
<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="youtube-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_v4T3PlSY0?si=l3YKHxWjX5ljboKP" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker says her upbringing influenced her morals and values at an early age.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her parents were communists, and many of her parents&#8217; friends were refugees, Jewish, or Black Communist intellectuals, artists, and writers. Aptheker says the values she was taught included struggles </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fascism, racism, antisemitism, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> social justice, equality.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of these friends were exceptionally kind and loving towards me. My earliest memories are infused with the values of social justice, and for peace. It was natural for me, in this sense, to participate in [civil rights and anti-war] movements while a UC Berkeley student.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She became involved in the Free Angela Davis movement a couple of years after graduating from UC Berkeley with an undergraduate degree.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The building of a transnational movement to Free Angela Davis in the early 1970s was a foundational experience for me in antiracist, social justice, and international organizing,&#8221; says Aptheker. &#8220;My scholarly work and my activism are intertwined,&#8221; she adds.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example is the first book she published, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If They Come in the Morning: Voices of Resistance,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which she and Davis co-edited and wrote essays for. It was published in England and the U.S. in 1971, then translated for editions in several countries. Her second published book was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Academic Rebellion in the United States: A Marxist Appraisal </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1972).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was a more scholarly work and very much came out of my experiences in the student movements of the 1960s.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her most recent book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communists in Closets: Queering the History, 1930s-1990s,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means a great deal to her personally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It allowed me to fuse my queer identity with social justice politics,&#8221; Aptheker said. &#8220;It&#8217;s based on 10 years of archival research and focuses on the struggles of lesbian and gay peoples in Communist and Left movements that were extremely homophobic even after the Stonewall rebellion for LGBT Rights in 1969.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Graduate School, Academic and Professional Influences</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chose UCSC&#8217;s History of Consciousness graduate program because it allowed her the most flexibility in pursuing feminist and Marxist works that interested her. Plus, in 1979, as a single parent with two small children who was struggling to claim her queer identity, she thought Santa Cruz was a good fit.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many former </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">faculty and staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made an impact on Aptheker&#8217;s journey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She lists Billie Harris, Hayden White, Diane Lewis Chaney, Donna Haraway, and Nicolette Czarrunchick, all of whom were instrumental in her time at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Billie Harris, who was for many years department manager for Hist Con, was welcoming, encouraging, and loving. Hayden White was an amazing mentor and strongly influenced my thinking about history and historical methods. He also facilitated my swift move though the Hist Con program. I had my doctorate by 1983. Likewise, a very important mentor was/is Donna Haraway, an extraordinary intellectual presence, mentor, so encouraging, and formative. And Diane Lewis Chaney, a medical anthropologist deeply supportive of my work in African American feminist history. Nicolette Czarrunchick was for many years the Women&#8217;s Studies program (and then department) manager. We worked together daily and in tandem for 25 years building Women&#8217;s Studies (renamed Feminist Studies in 2004).&#160; She was remarkable.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Teaching Career</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning a master&#8217;s degree in communication studies from San Jose State University enabled Aptheker to teach there and at UCSC. She first taught Black Women&#8217;s History for Afro American Studies and Women&#8217;s Studies at San Jose State, then taught this class for Kresge College in 1978. This was before she became a history of consciousness graduate student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After she entered graduate school at UCSC, she began teaching as a lecturer for Women&#8217;s Studies, which was then a fledgling program. She started with Introduction to Feminism in Winter 1981. The first class was a 35-student seminar. It grew more popular each year: 100 students in 1982, 200-plus in 1983, eventually reaching 475-500. She taught it every fall except two sabbatical years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Humanities Division, Aptheker </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">taught over 16,000 Intro to Fem students over the course of her career at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I immensely enjoyed teaching it. As feminist, anti-racist, and liberatory issues also changed, the course changed over the years. I taught it for the last time in 2008.&#8221; The class was filmed; a DVD of all lectures is available at McHenry Library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2009 Aptheker taught the new entry-level course Feminism &amp; Social Justice, which she continued until retirement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>In 2018, a vignette of Aptheker's course was developed in collaboration with the Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) as a massive open online course that is hosted on Coursera.&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursera.org/learn/feminism-social-justice&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701371226431000&amp;usg=AOvVaw21-5O8n0b7t8YtlS32_RMI" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/feminism-social-justice" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The course</a><span>&#160;furthers Aptheker's&#160;legacy of impact as an educator by transforming how people think about feminism and social justice.</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As of October 2023, 112,000 people had taken the online version of this course, literally forming a global feminist community,&#8221; says Aptheker.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is amazed by the email correspondence she&#8217;s had with this course&#8217;s students. &#8220;I have corresponded with people in India, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kurdistan, Turkey, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, and all over the U.S.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker, who is 79, retired in 2018, but still continues to mentor, especially graduate students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following her retirement, an </span><a href="https://humanities.ucsc.edu/giving/endowments/bettina-aptheker.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endowed scholarship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was established at UCSC in Aptheker&#8217;s honor. The scholarship supports students whose work relates to sexual, gendered, and/or racial violence to further their research, or to do community service.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Awards and Accolades</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker&#8217;s numerous awards include the 2004 Award for Excellence in Education by the California chapter of the National Organization for Women, receiving the 2017 John Dizikes Teaching Award in Humanities, and being named the inaugural appointee of the endowed Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies (2017-2021).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am honored and deeply appreciative for all of the accolades I&#8217;ve received,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker added that she particularly enjoyed receiving the UC Presidential Chair in Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies (CRES) alongside Karen Tei Yamashita. They received $75,000 each year through 2012-15 which allowed them to mount multiple programs in CRES, a newly established program major at the time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We brought poets, writers, artists to UCSC, and sponsored courses. We collaborated with the Living Writers Program in the Literature Department, the research cluster in Science &amp; Justice, The Humanities Institute, and so on. Among our most successful events was hosting Anita Hill in February 2015. This generous award allowed us to be of benefit to a very large number of students, staff, and faculty.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Family</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aptheker lives in Santa Cruz with her wife Kate Miller. They have been together 44 years. Their daughter Jenny lives in Santa Cruz with her partner Andrea and their son Sasha, a high school senior. Their son Jacob is at Arizona State. Their son Joshua lives in Berkeley with his wife Eka and their son Luca, who is at University of Washington, Seattle. Their daughter Lisa lives in British Columbia with her husband Conrad.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Advice</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if she has any advice for alumni or current UCSC students, she replied with this suggestion &#8220;for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Follow your passions insofar as you can so that you feel life to be full and deeply satisfying to you intellectually and emotionally. And be of as much service and benefit to others as you can.&#8221;</span></p>

These awards recognize and honor alumni who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievements, made distinct contributions to society, provided impactful contributions to UC Santa Cruz, and who have embodied the values and spirit of the university.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her contributions, dedication, and efforts to support Crown College, Lisa Rose (Crown &#8217;72, literature) was awarded the Fiat Lux Award on Oct. 27, 2023.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz was an exciting place to be in its early days. Lisa Rose, Crown College class of 1972, reflects fondly on her time as a UCSC student. She was the oldest of four and the first to go to college. &#8220;It was all very mysterious to me,&#8221; Rose says. &#8220;It was all new and surprising.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz was much smaller in the late &#8216;60s and early &#8216;70s, with only a few thousand students. Crown College had about 500 people living and teaching there, including students and staff. Describing Crown College at the time, Rose says it was &#8220;warm, family-like, with lots of young faculty and young families.&#8221; Faculty joined students for meals and attended college nights. UC Santa Cruz was the hallmark for free, top-notch, pass/fail, experimental education. Students like Rose were excited to be part of this great experiment.</span></p>
<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="youtube-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVKxRcTeziA?si=O272zDH_6EsPzO4o" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose returned to Santa Cruz in 1978 after a short stint as a math teacher in New Zealand and has not left since. In 1983 she earned an MBA at San Jose State University and worked for the Santa Cruz City Finance Department for seven years before returning to UCSC as the Director of University Business Services.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Photography leads Rose back to UCSC</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of her college experience was shaped by photography. Developing an interest in photography as a child, she was thrilled to discover that her dorm, Harvey House, had a dark room in the basement. &#8220;The most memorable thing I did [in college] was learning to create black and white photographic images,&#8221; Rose says. Black and white photography was very popular at the time and she took and printed hundreds of photos of life at Crown College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was her photography from those early years that led to the start of her volunteer work for Crown College. In 2002 when asked to help with the 30th reunion of the class of 1972, Rose gathered photos taken by five other Crown student photographers who sent her scans of their negatives. &#8220;I ended up with a collection of hundreds of images and was able to create a wall of photographs that was incredibly successful,&#8221; Rose says. &#8220;Those early photographs were the key to my ongoing involvement in Crown College. I think of them as the gift that keeps on giving.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, during the celebration of the 50th anniversary of Crown&#8217;s opening, Provost Manel Camps asked a group of pioneer alumni to help raise funds to modernize the Crown Library. A small group of alumni including Lisa, Susan Nerton, and Jim Lapsley raised over $75,000. Two years later, the same group came together to raise funds to refurbish the fireside lounge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;[It] made our hearts ache to realize how little [communal] space [students] have now compared to our experience 50 years ago. We asked ourselves, What can we do to help? Raise money!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this second successful fundraiser, seven Crown alumni founded the Crown Provost's Advisory Committee (CPAC) with the goal of supporting the vision of Provost Camps.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We realized Crown and all the colleges need additional funding,&#8221; Rose says. That is how they became interested in raising $1 million: the accomplishment that landed them all a Fiat Lux Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rose, Nerton, and Lapsley figured a 50th Crown reunion would be the perfect way to begin their fundraising efforts. &#8220;You can&#8217;t ask people for financial support without honoring their 50th reunion,&#8221; Rose says. Delayed by the pandemic, Rose, Nerton, and Lapsley invited all Crown alumni from the classes of 1968 through 1972 to the Crown 50th reunion held in April 2022. Once again, the black and white photos became central to the outreach to alumni. Rose created a website to promote the 50th reunion using dozens of </span><a href="https://crown50reunion.org/blog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://crown50reunion.org/gallery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photos from the early days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After 300 alumni were contacted, 75 Crown alumni attended the successful four day reunion held on campus. It was a hit, and Rose, Nerton, and Lapsley followed up with the fundraising campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the $1 million raised, mostly for the Crown endowment, Rose hopes Provost Camps can continue to enhance course offerings at Crown. The planning for the reunion and fundraising also marked the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Rose notes, &#8220;Even though we all knew each other in college, we weren&#8217;t close friends. By working together to organize Crown&#8217;s first 50th reunion and fundraise for Crown College, we&#8217;ve become very close.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would like alumni to be as excited as we are to give back to Crown to ensure that the students of today and tomorrow can have some of the remarkable experiences we had.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her contributions, dedication, and efforts to support Crown College, Susan Nerton </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Crown &#8217;71, &#8217;87, psychology and computer and information science)</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was awarded the Fiat Lux Award on Oct. 27, 2023.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We felt like pioneers,&#8221; Susan Nerton says, reflecting on her experience in the early years of Crown College 1967-71. Enrolling as a math major and science appreciator, she knew she wanted to be a part of the Crown College academic community. A fifth generation Californian from the working-class town of Pleasanton, she was the first in her family to attend university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Crown College wasn&#8217;t fully completed by move-in day. There were ditches. Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t lose anyone,&#8221; Nerton says. It was an exciting, social and intellectually stimulating environment. She remembers spending time studying in the college lounges and library with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> books. &#8220;The classroom building had listening rooms with turntables. There were lots of places where we could meet in groups,&#8221; she says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She remembers the Core courses required of all first-year students at UCSC. &#8220;We would have three or four excellent professors sharing a course, integrating their different disciplines and perspectives around a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">big idea</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The connections they were able to weave together. It was mind blowing,&#8221; Nerton says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After college, Nerton went on to a fulfilling 25-year career at Cabrillo Community College as a computer science educator and life-long STEM advocate. Having a role in shaping new learning opportunities for students has always been her mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Crown Provost Camps initiated a campaign to reconfigure the Crown College Library in order to provide critically needed meeting space for students whose dorm lounges had all been converted into dorm housing. &#8220;I realized that converting those dorm lounges into housing left the students with nowhere to go. The library was underused, poorly furnished, and had unpredictable Internet connectivity,&#8221; Nerton says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She joined the campaign along with several other Crown alumni who recognized the importance of upgrading the library and returning space to the students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years later, after raising $75,000 to remodel the library, the alumni friends decided the fireside lounge was next. &#8220;The fireside lounge needed a face lift,&#8221; Nerton says. They added a better TV, furniture, and lighting to make it more comfortable for students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this second fundraising effort, Nerton was eager to join Provost Camps&#8217; new Provost Advisory Committee (CPAC) made up of seven Crown pioneer alumni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the new CPAC contemplated their next project, it became quite clear that one thing they were uniquely positioned to do was raise endowment funds&#8212;a permanent source of additional annual funding&#8212;for Crown. This idea quickly became linked to the idea of holding Crown&#8217;s first 50th reunion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The year 2021 would mark 50 years since our graduation from Crown College. We wanted to have a party to celebrate,&#8221; Nerton says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with two other committee members, Lisa Rose and Jim Lapsley, Nerton volunteered to organize the first Crown 50th reunion and lead the fundraising campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is still so young that there is no history of these legacy events. The idea of highlighting a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">college</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 50th reunion hadn&#8217;t crossed anyone&#8217;s radar quite yet,&#8221; Nerton says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them, Nerton, Rose, and Lapsley put their different skills together to plan and organize the Crown College 50th Reunion including the classes 1968-72. COVID delayed the reunion until April 2022, but the extra planning time was to their benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was some pressure to integrate fundraising into the 50th Reunion from the beginning,&#8221; Nerton says. However, through multiple planning focus groups, the 50th reunion planning team found that many pioneer alumni did not want fundraising to be a focus. They wanted a party to reconnect with old friends. The planning team decided not to solicit donations during the reunion events. Interestingly enough, by the end of the reunion weekend in April 2022, pioneer alumni were asking us what they could do to further enhance the student experience at Crown College. This led to the Crown College campaign to raise $1 million for the college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nerton, Rose, and Lapsley received the Fiat Lux award for their fundraising efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="youtube-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVKxRcTeziA?si=O272zDH_6EsPzO4o" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was totally surprised by the whole thing,&#8221; Nerton says. &#8220;I look at the people who received the award previously and I&#8217;m really honored to be included in that group,&#8221; she says. Working hard with her alumni friends for five years, she says the work was enjoyable the whole time, despite its challenges. &#8220;We have become much better friends in the process. We&#8217;re closer now than we&#8217;ve ever been due to moving these projects to completion,&#8221; she says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is excited to help support an integrated curriculum that &#8220;gets people working together,&#8221; she says. She hopes the funding goes towards smaller class sizes and community building around <i>big ideas</i>. &#8220;When you&#8217;re relaxed and feeling trusted you learn better,&#8221; she says. </span></p>

UC Santa Cruz wants to celebrate the tremendous contributions our students have made, ensuring a safe, secure, and accessible voting experience for everyone in the campus community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would like to recognize the staff at SOMeCA and all of the student organizations that contributed and participated in the &#8220;Make a Note to Vote&#8221; campaign last year for the 2022 elections, which include:</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some examples of the work that these groups did for the campaign included the creation of T-shirts that had QR codes for voter registration information which were distributed freely to students. Students also tabled and spread the word at campus events like Cornucopia. In the fall of 2022, they hosted the </span><a href="https://cityonahillpress.com/2022/10/22/this-is-our-future-someca-hosts-tiffany-dena-loftin-to-getoutthevote/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Our Future: Take Back the Vote</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event with special guest speaker, UC Santa Cruz Alumni, Tiffany Dena Loftin, who discussed the importance of spreading the word about the coming election and the role that student organizations can have on its outcome.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a direct result of the student engagement efforts and support of SOMeCA staff in supporting student agency in voter engagement efforts, UC Santa Cruz was one of only 3 UC campuses and one of only 121 campuses in the country to earn the inaugural distinction of the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3CDM4a16hUp-F_bOTxjHDMODVIJ1aF5/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly Established Action Plan Seal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the 2022 election by the </span><a href="https://allinchallenge.org/campuses/university-of-california-santa-cruz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All In Campus Democracy Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, The UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement has also recognized these student organizations and SOMeCA staff in the </span><a href="https://freespeechcenter.universityofcalifornia.edu/programs-and-resources/voice-initiative/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 Valuing Open and Inclusive Conversation and Engagement (VOICE) Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that highlights UC campus projects focused on creating and strengthening opportunities for students, staff and faculty to impact their UC campus communities. UC Santa Cruz was awarded the Gold Award and $5,000 in funding to continue the work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine Canales-Molina, Associate Director of SOMeCA, wrote in the VOICE initiative proposal, &#8220;Student engagement in local, state, and national elections is far from being constant. It has peaks and valleys, despite the many political issues that concern students deeply. This project will grow ongoing student civic engagement at UC Santa Cruz by building a cohort of students, utilizing the attention that will be generated by the upcoming general elections. We plan to build on our pilot program beginning with a kickoff event, a keynote speaker, facilitated dialogues, and workshops. The project will link on-the-ground issues that students experience in their everyday lives with national policies and platforms to inspire action and involvement. Following the kickoff event, we will establish a dynamic workgroup of student leaders that will experiment with fostering structures that support continuity in understanding and valuing democratic practices. The Student Civic Engagement workgroup will create new programming from the ideas generated by the dialogues and will draw lessons from the different forms of engagement that result.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>We thank our campus Election Heroes.</strong></p>

The EcoHus team was selected to receive a $100,000 grant to participate in the </span><a href="https://ocsd23.com/team/ucsc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Orange County Sustainability Decathlon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (OCSD) held on Oct. 5-15, where they won first place in three categories, and secured second and third place in other categories.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"With the goal of making beautiful, functional, affordable, and environmentally groundbreaking creations that are fire and drought resistant, leave no carbon footprint and aim to do no less than help save the planet, our success in the competition showed what UC Santa Cruz students are capable of,&#8221; said Dr. Sue Carter, UC Santa Cruz Physics Professor and Rachel Carson College Provost who served as the project lead and faculty advisor for EcoHus. &#8220;Our students are already dreaming up ideas to build for next year.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OCSD, an international collegiate competition that seeks to inspire students to find solutions to California housing and climate change challenges, selected 14 teams to compete in this year&#8217;s decathlon. The homes were built and displayed in a &#8220;sustainable village&#8221; at the Orange County Fair and Event Center during the competition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ecohushomes.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz's EcoHus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secured first place in the categories of water use and conservation, energy efficiency, and innovation. It also claimed second place in market potential and third place in lighting and appliances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EcoHus was the only largely student-built home to receive awards as most entries had substantial portions of the homes built by professional contractors. The students not only designed the home, but also installed all functional components, including all welding and plasma cut structural components, wood framed walls, plumbing, electric, insulation, drywall, flooring and windows and doors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="decathlon-2.jpeg" height="313" src="images/decathlon-2.jpeg" width="500"/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project was a truly interdisciplinary collaboration, spanning the Engineering, Physical and Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, and Arts Divisions at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Working on this construction project with people of all different backgrounds has brought in a lot of fresh ideas. I have gained a lot of perspective on team building and expanded my view of the construction process beyond the conventional,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli Nygren, EcoHus project lead.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for the EcoHus&#8217; $150,000 construction cost was secured in 2022 through a $100,000 grant from Charitable Ventures, 2022 Giving Day, NSF I-corps fund, and a grant to work on the Net Zero Water Systems&#160; from </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/citris-seedfunds-2022.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society and the Banatao Institute (CITRIS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160; In addition, UCSC staff members, Annette Truong and Tuong Truong donated their time, and community members Rick Woods and Glenn Alers donated their time and materials. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design aimed to create an affordable home in harmony with nature &#8211; a house within a greenhouse &#8211; and was inspired by the 1970s concept of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NaturHus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or Nature House. by Swedish Architect Bengt Warne. EcoHus makes greenhouse homes more sustainable and affordable, and is therefore coined &#8220;Eco&#8221;Hus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="decathlon-1.jpeg" height="262" src="images/decathlon-1.jpeg" width="512"/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EcoHus, designed to accommodate four-to-six-people, features a 1,000-square-foot floor plan with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Its 1,800-square-foot roof is equipped with solar panels and supported by a greenhouse frame. This innovative design helps regulate the temperature of the house and provides outdoor space for rainwater collection and gardening. The garden is large enough to feed a family of four under protected conditions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maximize the use of reclaimed materials, the house design incorporates two shipping containers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are 20 million or so shipping containers in circulation and hundreds of millions abandoned,&#8221; noted Dr. Carter. &#8220;So it&#8217;s a material that&#8217;s underutilized.&#8221; Starting with the metal frames from the containers also meant the EcoHus required about 70% less wood than the other houses in the competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart lighting and appliances contributed to the win in energy efficiency, and the house won first place in water use and conservation for the way it captures rainwater and recycles greywater from showers and sinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The greywater is sent to a custom-built, bioremediation system, which was basically designed to mimic wetlands,&#8221; said Dr. Carter. The water then goes through a carbon filter and a UV filter and is combined with rainwater for use in landscaping and toilets. A set of sensors make sure the water is properly purified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students tackled every aspect of the project together. The build site was in Riverside to reduce shipping costs to Orange County, and students lived, ate, and worked on-site during their classes and build weeks, fostering a strong sense of community and dedication to the house's design and construction. The house took a total of 6 weeks to build, with construction running from April through October 2023.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This project was a completely new learning experience for me, as it is a completely different field from which I study. So I have learned a lot! The most valuable experience has been the work week, as it provided direct hands-on experience in construction and sustainable building,&#8221; said Green Construction Intern, Hayden Johnson (4 year, Marine Biology).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to building a sustainable home, students also created a </span><a href="https://www.ecohushomes.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsc_ocsd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> account, and prepared a </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P_5Nd-0bGS9dCAs3sCqF5VMHvRFZRRsg/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garden Kitchen Recipe Book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that incorporated fresh ingredients grown in the EcoHus garden.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This project provided students with a great opportunity to build experiences that they can apply in their future careers, as well as providing them with the skills to someday build their own sustainable house,&#8221; said Mana Iwata, EcoHus Design and Communications Tech.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of UC Santa Cruz's EcoHus project highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative design in addressing sustainability challenges, and underscores the educational opportunities and potential within the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Carson College Sustainability Minor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The achievements of the UC Santa Cruz students behind EcoHus stand as an example of how such partnerships and learning experiences can effectively address real-world sustainability and resilience challenges.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best known for producing the U.S.&#8217;s longest-running daytime soap opera, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days of Our Lives</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Corday is a six-time daytime Emmy winner for music direction and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/ken-corday-recital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 17, Corday will perform in a solo piano recital at UCSC&#8217;s Music Center.&#160;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>"Any chance to return to my alma mater and encourage young minds to explore their own original creative pursuits is a blessing and a privilege that I do not take lightly," Corday said. "I am forever in awe at the vibrance and spirit of the UCSC community. I hope that students leave with a renewed sense of peace as they continue with their scholastic journeys. Go Slugs!"</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corday graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a Bachelor of Arts in Aesthetic Studies in 1975 and a Master&#8217;s degree in Music Composition from San Jose State University in 1977. He said that his music education at UCSC was instrumental for his work as a television producer, and wants to uplift current students pursuing similar careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has established two endowed chairs in the Arts Division over the past eight years, focusing his philanthropy at UCSC to music, film, media, and film writing courses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are overjoyed to welcome back eminent alumnus Ken Corday to UC Santa Cruz and the Music Center for this special solo piano recital,&#8221; said UCSC Arts Dean Celine Parrenas Shimizu. &#8220;While he is celebrated as the Executive Producer for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days of Our Lives</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his multi-Emmy-winning compositions capture and deploy emotion so powerfully. It will be a moving experience for which our community of Banana Slugs is so excited.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corday established The Kenneth R. Corday Family Chair in Music for Film, Television, Emerging Media, and Multimedia Collaboration in June 2022. His generous and transformational gift is used to provide the appointed chair holder a scholarly allowance to support teaching, research, and service in music for film, television, and media. This is the second gift of its kind that Corday has made to UCSC. In 2015 he established a separate Chair </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Writing for Television and Film dedicated to theater and new media arts education at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ken's dedication to supporting arts education through two endowed chairs greatly enriches our programs,&#8221; Shimizu added. &#8220;His latest gift, The Kenneth R. Corday Family Chair in Music for Film, Television, Emerging Media, and Multimedia Collaboration, is a transformative contribution that will empower our faculty to continue shaping the next generation of creative minds in these fields."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corday emphasizes that UCSC was instrumental in his educational development and his pursuit of the arts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Once you&#8217;ve achieved a certain level of proficiency and professionalism in the world and have had the wherewithal to be charitable, your first look should be to the people that got you where you&#8217;re going or where you are,&#8221; Corday said in a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/ken-corday.html">past interview</a>. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today had I not gone to UC Santa Cruz and had not gone on to graduate school. So it&#8217;s time for me to give back.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The music recital will take place on Friday, Nov. 17 at the Music Center Recital Hall.

The 24 team members join Director Monique Leduc on Zoom for a huddle. The 15-30 minutes they spend together is one of the keys to the 100% remote unit&#8217;s success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The main reason we meet is so that everybody feels connected, feels that human connection, so people don&#8217;t feel so isolated,&#8221; Leduc said. &#8220;We used to see each other in the hallway. Now we see each other on Zoom.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to her team and the work of Enterprise Financial Systems, communication, connection and inclusion are top priorities.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monique Leduc is the 2023 recipient of the UC Santa Cruz Outstanding Staff Award (OSA). The award recognizes staff members who provide distinguished service each day to the students, staff and faculty of our campus.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><strong>34 years of service</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leduc has been a valued member of the UC Santa Cruz community for 34 years, starting as an assistant analyst in the Financial Aid office in 1989. Six years later, she moved to the office that became Financial Affairs and has worked there ever since.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1999, Monique was promoted to manager of the Financial Information System group and in 2005, EFS was created, and she was named, and continues to be, the director. The unit manages the Financial Information System, which is the system of record for the official UCSC financial ledgers and chart of accounts; CruzBuy, the campus electronic procurement system; CruzPay, the time and attendance system staff members use to report hours worked and leave taken (as appropriate for their positions; CruzFly, the campus travel and expense management system; the Effort Reporting System (ERS), a web-based system used to certify effort supported by federal funds; and the main </span><a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial Affairs website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Monique is an exceptional leader and has been integral to charting our digital financial environment,&#8221; said Associate Vice Chancellor/Campus Controller Biju Kamaleswaran. &#8220;Her dedication to UC Santa Cruz drives her passion for building a better digital environment for our community. Her vision has shaped our digital landscape and fostered a capable team that consistently delivers results, steering us toward a successful future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2006, the campus financial processes went from being decentralized to centralized. Launching the new CruzBuy and CruzPay systems was a crucial part of that. &#8220;They were two new campuswide, branded systems. Both of those projects were very complex. We were all very proud of actually getting them up and running. It had been in progress for a few years before that, but that&#8217;s when it all came together,&#8221; Leduc said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She is dogged about solving problems, even if there isn't an easy fix,&#8221; User &amp; Production Support Team Manager Anne Depage said. &#8220;Sometimes it takes years to get things where they should be, but she sees it through.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leduc uses her deep institutional knowledge to give her staff context on how things were done in the past so they can see how they got to that point. &#8220;As a public institution, as opposed to a private corporation, we are here for the duration. We were here 50 years ago, and we&#8217;re going to be here 50 years from now, so it&#8217;s a continuum of change.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she is the person managing the unit, Leduc says her role is to empower and equip her team. &#8220;The people in EFS are very smart. They know their job, they&#8217;ve been here a while and they really are the primary drivers for the success of the systems. I might steer the boat a little bit to make sure that we're meeting executive-level timelines, but really, the drive comes from the team.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Monique's department is a "simmering pot" of a variety of business systems, each one of which has evolving needs and unique issues,&#8221; said Annette Truong,&#160; CruzPay &amp; ERS Manager. &#8220;She is a steady rudder of support helping each system caretaker adapt to changing policies and needs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Outstanding Staff Award</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than two and a half decades, the Staff Advisory Board (SAB), UCSC Alumni Association and the Chancellor&#8217;s Office have worked together to honor a member of the staff through the annual Outstanding Staff Award. Nominations are solicited across campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the highest award a UCSC staff member can receive,&#8221; said Lumpy Ervin, chair of the Staff Advisory Board. &#8220;It honors them for their exemplary work supporting our campus community every day. We thank those who took time to nominate their colleagues and bring attention to their work. There were many outstanding nominees this year, and selecting a winner was not easy.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nomination criteria includes, going "above and beyond" to provide distinguished service to students, staff, or faculty colleagues; champions the work of their department/division and adapts to changing needs; fosters the Principles of Community; embraces and values diversity, strives for an inclusive community, and promotes mutual respect, trust and support that strengthens the UCSC community; and engages or volunteers in UCSC activities and promotes campus initiatives.</span></p>
<p><strong>Three guiding pillars</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leduc&#8217;s work is guided by three pillars: open communication, mutual respect and a sense of humor.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to make sure my team members are fully informed about things that will affect their jobs, our systems, or affect us at the campus level.&#8221; During the morning huddles, she shares campus communications and events, such as the message from Chancellor Larive celebrating the start of the new academic year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I go through it, and I say, &#8216;Which of these things affect Enterprise Financial Systems?&#8217; Some of them won&#8217;t at all, but read between the lines. When you drill down, you see it will affect us.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through these conversations, the group examines how process and business changes happening in other units affect them. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want them to have a narrow vision. It&#8217;s very important for them to see that we are part of the whole. I&#8217;m sure I bore them to death a lot when I say, &#8216;Well, in 1992...&#8217; but I want them to understand what&#8217;s going on at UCSC.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an inclusive work environment is at the center of all she does. &#8220;We take the </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/principles-community/#:&#126;:text=The%20University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa,practice%20these%20Principles%20of%20Community."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principles of Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to heart and mutual respect is a big part of that,&#8221; Leduc explained. The principles are &#8220;a big part of how I try to make sure that people are engaged and coming forward and giving their ideas. People should feel confident and safe in being able to express themselves and their ideas.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third thing that shapes Leduc&#8217;s leadership is a sense of humor. &#8220;We have to look at the light side of things,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Humor is a way to let off steam respectfully when things are stressful.&#8221; Leduc says that&#8217;s even more important now that they work 100 percent remotely. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b0424f548072704637945e9109ff4d25"><name>bruce-lane-memorial-scholarship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Veteran students excel with Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship</title><summary>The Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship was established to support veteran students at UC Santa Cruz.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from 2018, nearly 700,000 veterans use VA education benefits, namely the GI Bill, to pay for college, graduate school and training programs, and that number appears to be growing. Across the University of California system of 10 schools, nearly 2,000 veterans and students with military affiliations attend. At UC Santa Cruz, veterans make up a much smaller percentage of the overall student body&#8212;but that doesn&#8217;t deflect from the support and camaraderie they find with one another, and with the support of veterans&#8217; focused scholarships.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://giving.ucsc.edu/impact-of-giving/support-for-those-who-have-served/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was established in memory of Bruce Lane, who worked at UC Santa Cruz for 27 years as a project architect, educational facilities planner, and director of capital planning. Lane (who passed in 2008) was a volunteer for immediate induction in World War II, and left to serve the U.S. in Europe just two weeks after graduating from high school. Lane worked as a noncommissioned officer and later received the GI Bill, before then working as a commissioned engineer officer for the Army Reserves for 35 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His wife, Maxine Lane, continued on his legacy by founding his namesake scholarship 15 years ago to share in his passion to support UCSC&#8217;s military veteran students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Palance is one of this year&#8217;s scholarship cohort, currently in his third year in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology doctoral program. Prior to pursuing his Ph.D., Palance was a commissioned officer in the </span><a href="https://www.noaa.gov"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;s (NOAA) Commissioned Officer Corps for eight years. He was assigned to federal research vessels and fisheries labs across the country, spanning from Arctic Alaska to San Diego and the Gulf Coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a certain point, he felt he had hit "a bit of a roadblock" in his professional trajectory and career goals, and he saw that an advanced degree would help make him more viable for permanent positions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In researching more about what doctoral programs he&#8217;d be interested in attending, UCSC stood out, particularly because of its serene location and world-class research in marine science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love the area&#8212;I&#8217;m a super outdoorsy person, so having the mountains and ocean in the same place is ideal,&#8221; Palance said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palance is primarily advised by </span><a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/about/dept-directory.php?uid=rsbeltra">Assistant Professor Roxanne Beltran</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UCSC. In addition, he is co-advised by </span><a href="https://hazen.sites.ucsc.edu">Elliott Hazen</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a NOAA employee and UCSC adjunct professor who works out of NOAA&#8217;s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in Monterey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve done some pretty cutting-edge research equipping northern elephant seals with a suite of state-of-the-art bio-logging instruments, a field I didn&#8217;t have any previous experience in myself,&#8221; Palance said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, this past year&#8217;s Bruce Lane award helped fund a trip to France&#8217;s La Rochelle Universit&#233; to further develop and strengthen relationships with international collaborators on the elephant seal project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Palance is part of a coastwide project with Hazen, investigating the effects of climate change on large marine predators such as whales and their prey and the impacts on coastal communities and National Marine Sanctuaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Palance enjoys his studies, he&#8217;s also found a great deal of joy in finding other veterans across campus and scholarship opportunities. A fellow veteran student, Andrew Lankow, introduced Palance to the veterans&#8217; emails chain&#8212;which first introduced Palance to the Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship. Palance received the scholarship in both the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, at $1,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having a bit more cash to help pay for supplies has been really nice&#8230;as well as the sense of project ownership and financial independence scholarships such as the Bruce Lane [Scholarship] help provide,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Devin Burkland, the Bruce Lane Scholarship funding has helped him to make the most of his undergraduate experience. Burkland returned to school after serving in the U.S. Navy. About six years after leaving the service, while working odd jobs, Burkland aimed to tell his and other veterans&#8217; stories, leading to his pursuit of a bachelor&#8217;s in history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to record veterans and their time of service, so we can preserve their stories&#8212;I think a lot of those particular stories get overlooked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is something I&#8217;m passionate about, and I realized this was a route I wanted to pursue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burkland received his associate&#8217;s degree from Merced Community College, and in looking to transfer, decided upon UCSC. Having been stationed in San Diego, Burkland missed the ocean, and was grateful to have the chance to be near it again while working toward his higher education goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, he was able to connect with other veterans on campus, joining </span><a href="https://stars.ucsc.edu/veteran/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Veterans Resource Center </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in work study and connecting with other veterans. He says his group of veterans includes between 10 to 20 close-knit people, including Jerry Cabilatazan, the veterans program coordinator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We feel like fish out of water&#8212;a lot of us are older, a lot of us experienced different life experiences [than other students],&#8221; Burkland said. &#8220;We remind each other that we&#8217;ve been through worse, and we support each other.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Bruce Lane Scholarship, Burkland was able to purchase recording equipment to start his work, capturing veterans&#8217; stories. He was inspired to launch this as part of his major after a visit to the national Student Veterans Association Convention in Orlando this past January, where he learned about </span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/veterans-history-project/about-this-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Veterans History Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and saw more of veterans&#8217; stories on a national stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Burkland can contribute to the project himself, which he says helps his fellow veterans too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just talking about your time in service can be therapeutic&#8212;these stories should be told,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The scholarship has been extremely helpful; otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to buy equipment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Palance and Burkland, acknowledge that they are grateful to the scholarship and to the G.I. Bill for the opportunity to continue their studies, and they encourage their fellow student veterans to apply for the funds as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burkland plans to apply for the scholarship again, and said it&#8217;s another resource that matters in his grander education trajectory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People do want to help us with our passions and pursue our degrees&#8212;it&#8217;s such a nice feeling knowing that there are people willing to support us,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

Controlled burns may continue in the park until December 15, however due to the increased precipitation in the region, it is likely that these may be the last controlled burns of the season.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>The prescribed burns of roughly 300 acres are </span><strong>scheduled between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.</strong><span>&#160;All burning will depend on weather and air-quality conditions that are favorable for smoke dispersal. If the conditions are not conducive for burning, the burns will be rescheduled. The State Parks will monitor and patrol the area through the following week and weekend.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>Wilder Ranch is a 7,000-acre state park west of UC Santa Cruz that goes from the coastline into the mountains. Some trails may be closed temporarily to ensure public safety, such as Englesmann Loop, Eucalyptus Loop, Old Cabin and Long Meadow Trail.</span><br/><br/><strong>WHAT TO DO:</strong><span> If you are affected by air-quality issues, stay indoors or leave the immediate area. Close windows until the burn has concluded. You can find information on the Air Quality Index (AQI) and local air-monitoring resources online. In addition, Environmental Health &amp; Safety provides information on wildfire smoke and ways to protect yourself.</span><br/><br/><span>Campus affiliates with respiratory illness, other medical conditions that may be exacerbated by smoke exposure, and any others that may be concerned about their smoke particulate exposure may pick up filtering masks (N95s) from the following locations:</span><br/><br/><span>McHenry Library: Circulation Desk</span><br/><span>Science and Engineering Library: Circulation Desk</span><br/><span>Bay Tree Bookstore: Help Desk</span><br/><br/><strong>REDUCE EXPOSURE:</strong><span> If the AQI is in the unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous ranges, limit your outdoor activities and stay inside with the windows and doors closed, or if possible, leave the area. Drink plenty of fluids to keep your airway moist and easier to clear. If you are feeling ill due to poor air quality, seek advice from your medical provider.</span><br/><br/><span>For more information, please visit our wildland fire resource pages at:</span><br/><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs%3Dad9d1db1519c1cf5947fdbbb55a4e754527855c75947012e6f33411ef5a6146f582163f66e5851e7013ceb429309350e&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1699555642263000&amp;usg=AOvVaw16Md-SU5evYKPfTtw9ssC6" href="https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs=ad9d1db1519c1cf5947fdbbb55a4e754527855c75947012e6f33411ef5a6146f582163f66e5851e7013ceb429309350e" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wildfire Awareness">Wildfire Awareness</a><br/><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs%3Dad9d1db1519c1cf533cf8a2715eca44a4d36a010501747560007ca2fc81a4b17c1ee6a90691fcc4f88264aedab40c7c9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1699555642263000&amp;usg=AOvVaw01M7mL9pv5lZY6uqpMGyhg" href="https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs=ad9d1db1519c1cf533cf8a2715eca44a4d36a010501747560007ca2fc81a4b17c1ee6a90691fcc4f88264aedab40c7c9" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wildfire Smoke - Employee Protection from Wildfire Smoke">Wildfire Smoke - Employee Protection from Wildfire Smoke</a><br/><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs%3Dad9d1db1519c1cf5d26322dd3e9d4c357fed1395f9d4f2d8eabad1c01bc3b761692774cbfd29bf1dddfb4d96fc4072dc&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1699555642263000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2z3rV7sYIMADGKYqI11ogB" href="https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs=ad9d1db1519c1cf5d26322dd3e9d4c357fed1395f9d4f2d8eabad1c01bc3b761692774cbfd29bf1dddfb4d96fc4072dc" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Press Release: Wilder Ranch State Park Prescribed Fire Operations">Press Release: Wilder Ranch State Park Prescribed Fire Operations</a><br/><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs%3Dad9d1db1519c1cf59fbf5f86e138302cefbf9694e5f690932385fd54aa7413e97647e16cd46d87a8440f4c86f4f2ccd7&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1699555642263000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3T6Ov4dck6vIyIt4JTNVxc" href="https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs=ad9d1db1519c1cf59fbf5f86e138302cefbf9694e5f690932385fd54aa7413e97647e16cd46d87a8440f4c86f4f2ccd7" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Prescribed Burn in Progress at Wilder Ranch">Prescribed Burn in Progress at Wilder Ranch</a></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Public Affairs</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b05317598072704637945e91418e30d3"><name>bell-hooks-alumni-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>bell hooks’s legacy turns a new page</title><summary>For her remarkable legacy and lifelong contributions in the fields of literature and feminist studies, bell hooks posthumously received the Alumni Achievement Award on Oct. 27, 2023.

These awards recognize and honor alumni who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievements, made distinct contributions to society, provided impactful contributions to UCSC, and who have embodied the values and spirit of the university.&#160;&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her remarkable legacy and lifelong contributions in the fields of literature and feminist studies, bell hooks posthumously received the Alumni Achievement Award on Oct. 27, 2023. Her family accepted the award on her behalf.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">bell hooks fit many achievements into her 69 years of life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author&#8212;born Gloria Jean Watkins but best known by her pen name, dating back to the 1970s&#8212;published dozens of novels and books of poetry, including renowned classics <em>Ain&#8217;t I a Woman?</em> (1981) and <em>All About Love</em> (2000). She shared her texts with her ever-rising number of fans, speaking at post-secondary institutions around the world and teaching at Yale, UC Santa Cruz, Oberlin, and the City College of New York before taking a tenured position at Berea College in her childhood state of Kentucky in 2014.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2021, the author passed away in Berea, which led to an outpouring of tributes from colleagues, friends, and dignitaries, including Vice President Kamala Harris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to her successes and global recognition, hooks completed her doctorate in literature at UC Santa Cruz in 1983&#8212;and, on October 27, 40 years later, her family received </span><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/programs-services/alumni-awards/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an Alumni Achievement Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in her place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"bell hooks was a luminary whose profound contributions to the fields of race, feminism, and class transformed our understanding of intersectionality and systemic oppression,&#8221; said UCSC Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder. &#8220;Her incisive writings and impassioned advocacy resonated far and wide, challenging us to confront and dismantle the structures of inequality that persist in our society. Her work continues to inspire and guide generations of scholars and activists. We are honored to posthumously recognize her with the UCSC Alumni Achievement Award, as her legacy will forever shape the discourse in the humanities and beyond."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gwenda Motley attended the ceremony to receive her late sister&#8217;s award, and shared a humorous anecdote regarding the university&#8217;s acknowledgement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She received tons of awards that a lot of times she didn&#8217;t even go to accept,&#8221; she said through laughter, a month prior to the event. &#8220;She was not the person who enjoyed ceremonies &#8230; there are awards that we didn&#8217;t even know she received.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the UCSC Humanities Division selected bell hooks to receive the Graduate Student Alumni Award. Professor Emerita Bettina Aptheker, a friend of hooks's, accepted the award in her honor.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Gloria before bell</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">hooks was born to a working-class African American family in 1952, one of six children living in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Her father, Veodis Watkins, worked as a janitor, while her mother, Rosa Bell Watkins, was a maid for white families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hooks had an early love of reading and writing that helped her reach her potential as a renowned author, her sister clarifies that she and the rest of the Watkins family grew up with Gloria. Motley was three years younger than Gloria, and she saw her older sister frequently fit into her role as the family&#8217;s bookworm, only later learning how Gloria&#8217;s love of literature would transpire into a lifelong career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I did not realize that she would become who she was, but she did always tell us that she was going to be famous,&#8221; Motley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Watkins home, Gloria slept closest to the steps of the girls&#8217; shared bedroom with sisters Valerie, Sarah, and Angela, which allowed Gloria to keep a light on later in the night for reading and writing. The siblings&#8217; weekly visits to the library gave the other girls the chance to pick up one book apiece, like Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys, but gave Gloria the chance to check out up to 10 books of Shakespeare, Dickinson, and the like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even as a young child, I can remember that she was very advanced,&#8221; Motley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later, in high school, Gloria won a contest called &#8220;I Speak for Democracy,&#8221; where she wrote a piece that she then shared on the local radio station. It was the first time a Black person had won the contest, but Gwenda remembered Gloria was upset after receiving her prize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The radio announcer told her, &#8216;Well, if they had seen you, you probably would not have won,&#8217;&#8221; Motley said. &#8220;That really put a damper on her winning, and she thought, 'Why not?' Her piece was the best of the best&#8212;she was always shaking off the rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Becoming bell</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the hardships of growing up in integration, Gloria was always keenly aware of what she could do and what she wanted to do. As Motley said, it was clear from childhood that her sister was &#8220;an intellectual genius,&#8221; and that fact was made even clearer when she left Kentucky for California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloria enrolled at Stanford University, where she received her bachelor of arts in English in 1973, before returning to the Midwest to receive her master&#8217;s in English from the University of Madison-Wisconsin in 1976. It was during this time that she began writing her first book, <em>Ain&#8217;t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism,</em> which was then published under the pseudonym bell hooks in 1981.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motley visited Gloria in every place she lived, seeing her older sister come into her own as an author through each experience. She recalls visiting Gloria at Yale University during one of her reading events, where there were &#8220;over 2,000 people&#8221; in attendance. Two young women behind Motley whispered incessantly, ultimately tapping her on the shoulder and asking if she was bell&#8217;s sister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I said no, and they looked at me so strangely,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;Finally, I said, &#8216;oh, you mean Gloria?&#8217; And that was my introduction to her being called bell &#8230; that was truly my awakening to, wow, she is bell hooks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author chose her pen name based on her maternal great-grandmother, Bell Blair Hooks, whom Gloria was compared to from an early age; she put the name in lowercase letters both as a tribute and to focus on her work over herself. From the Yale reading onward, Motley knew her sister as the pen name the world called her by, but the family continued to call her Gloria.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Her sister&#8217;s vision</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few decades, the Watkins family saw hooks's influence continue to rise, but the relationship between sisters always remained strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She never put on with us, she never expected us to worship her&#8212;sometimes, she even annoyed us,&#8221; Motley said, laughing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even still, it seemed as though hooks was never able to &#8220;turn off&#8221; her intellect, let alone her ability to retain information about other people. Those traits helped her to become such a worldwide force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She was able to connect and relate to anyone no matter who you were,&#8221; Motley said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s what made her so phenomenal and internationally famous.&#8221;</span></p>

These awards recognize and honor alumni who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievements, made distinct contributions to society, provided impactful contributions to UCSC, and who have embodied the values and spirit of the university.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips received the Alumni Achievement Award on Oct. 27, 2023, for his pioneering supernova research that led to the reversal of a major scientific theory on the trajectory of the universe, and for the indelible legacy he has left for aspiring astronomers.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A comet in the southern California sky ignited in Mark Phillips (Ph.D. &#8217;77, astronomy &amp; astrophysics) a lifelong passion for studying the cosmos and inspired a brilliant career as a world-renowned astronomer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a mathematical mind and habitual curiosity, Phillips was destined for a megastar career behind a telescope. His interest in the galaxies was sparked when his father woke him in the middle of the night to witness a comet in the San Diego sky when he was in junior high school. A science unit on constellations, an amateur astronomy magazine, and tutoring sessions to help his sister through an astronomy course in college fueled his decision to study astronomy and math at San Diego State and to pursue a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>

<h3><strong>UCSC professor instilled his love of research</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pursuing his Ph.D. at UCSC, Phillips worked as a research assistant for Dr. Don Osterbrock, who became an important mentor for Phillips, both personally and professionally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He had a tremendous impact on my career,&#8221; said Phillips. &#8220;He was a second father to me. He instilled in me the love of research, and bird watching!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osterbrock, an avid birder, invited Phillips to go birding soon after he arrived on campus. Phillips found that he not only enjoyed having an eye on the night sky, but he also enjoyed searching for birds during the day. This shaped his lifelong interest in photographing birds, which he enjoys near his home in La Serena, Chile.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>The mountains drew him to Chile; the night sky kept him there</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A California native, Phillips did not anticipate spending 44 years of his life in Chile. It was his love for hiking that first drew him to the South American country that boasts endless mountain ranges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A scientist from the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CITO) came to campus to recruit young astronomers,&#8221; said Phillips. &#8220;I liked to hike, and I knew Chile was famous for mountains, so I was intrigued.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips and his roommate, Steve Hawley (Ph.D. &#8217;77, astronomy &amp; astrophysics), ventured to Chile together. Their shared experience launched careers in which they would become pioneers in their field&#8211;Phillips on the ground and Hawley in the sky. Hawley, who became a NASA astronaut, received the 1985-86 UCSC Alumni Achievement Award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips acclimated well to South America. He mastered conversational Spanish&#8211;impressing Silvanna, a native Chilean, whom he married&#8211;and after postdoctoral work in Australia, he returned to a staff position at CITO. During his 18-year tenure he made a revolutionary discovery.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Pioneering formula was impetus to scientific breakthrough</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After more than a decade of research on powerful energy sources in the nuclei of galaxies&#8212;a continuation of the work on which he and Osterbrock collaborated at UCSC&#8212;Phillips turned his attention to supernovae (exploding stars), and specifically, Type Ia supernovae. There was one significant hurdle: supernovae can only be seen in the Milky Way Galaxy about every 100 years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We found a telescope that could help us discover Type Ia supernovae in tens of other galaxies, giving us an enormous amount of data,&#8221; said Phillips.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He began measuring the light patterns with time of Type Ia supernovae with never-before-used methods. He published his new formula on how to precisely measure cosmic distances&#8212;referred to as the Phillips Relationship&#8212;in a seminal paper in 1993. It was a breakthrough that fueled excitement within the cosmology community and opened new opportunities that would have astronomical scientific impacts.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A trip back in time uncovered a key to the future</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After that study was released, it was game on,&#8221; said Phillips, who with colleagues from Chile formed the Cal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#225;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n/Tololo Supernova Survey. The team used the brightness of the Type Ia supernova to produce precise calibrations and measurements of the Hubble Constant, which provides information on the rate of expansion and the age of the universe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips then joined a group of 20 astronomers in forming the High-Z Supernova Search team, which measured the light of distant supernovae that exploded billions of years ago. According to Phillips, this work enabled them to essentially look back in time to gain a better understanding of how the universe has evolved with time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We went further back in time to search for supernovae when they were much further away, and measured the expansion rate as a function time, looking backwards,&#8221; said Phillips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that is when a major scientific discovery with philosophical implications was discovered.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A decades-long theory gets reversed</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had always thought that after the Big Bang, the expansion of the universe would slow down with time due to the force of gravity,&#8221; said Phillips. &#8220;But what we found was that it was actually expanding and accelerating. It was totally unexpected and a complete reversal of the theory that astronomers had held for decades.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These shocking new findings by the High-Z Supernova Search team, along with those published by an independent research team at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, led to the idea that a mysterious Dark Energy is acting against gravity to accelerate the expansion of the universe. For their extraordinary discovery, both teams were honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Phillips and the High-Z Supernova Search team all shared in the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize, widely acknowledged in the field of cosmology as second only to the Nobel Prize. The team also was honored with the 2015 Breakthrough Prize for Fundamental Physics.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>What&#8217;s next?&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though recently retired, the light on his illustrious career is still flickering as Phillips wraps up a paper on decades-long research he began at Carnegie&#8217;s Las Campanas Observatory, where he served for 14 years.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips spent his entire career in observatories exploring stars that exploded millions of years ago in galaxies far away to help shed light on the future of our own universe. And like the constellations that were his North star, his legacy work will guide and inspire the next generation of astronomers curious to unlock the mysteries that lie beyond them. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving Day, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s biggest fundraising event of the year, wraps up on a high note with a record-breaking $1.5 million raised within 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second year in a row that Giving Day brought in more than $1 million. This year, UCSC saw a record number of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">donations, projects, and challenges, shattering last year&#8217;s totals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funds raised during the event directly benefit student and campus projects, helping to ensure students have access to financial support, secure sources for basic needs, mental-health resources, opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research, and connections that catalyze their social mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Giving Day at UC Santa Cruz stands as a testament to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the extraordinary spirit and generosity of our community,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;Raising more than $1.5 million in just 24 hours is a monumental achievement that will have a lasting impact on our students and campus. This remarkable accomplishment reflects the dedication and commitment of our community to furthering the educational opportunities and experiences our campus offers. It is a true celebration of what we can achieve when we come together for a common cause."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenna Hurley, associate director of annual giving (Cowell &#8217;13, psychology) and main organizer of Giving Day, emphasized the positive impact the 24-hour event has on students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This event is all about our Slugs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It's about providing them with the resources and opportunities that will truly shape their futures. It's a powerful reminder of the incredible impact we can make when we rally together in support of their aspirations."&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>The final countdown&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time-based challenges throughout the day boosted the 24-hour fundraising effort, encouraging donors to give during select times. Projects that received the most donors during select time slots were awarded bonus dollars.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Rugby secured first-place wins in two challenges and top-three wins in four additional ones. With the additional $10,000 in challenge prizes, Slug Rugby&#8217;s earnings catapulted to $47,000. The campus&#8217; first-ever sports team &#8212; the squad was founded in 1966 &#8212; Slug Rugby relied on its large alumni base to become one of Giving Day&#8217;s most widely supported projects with 405 donations. This is the first year both the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s rugby teams came together for Giving Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m incredibly proud of the Slug Rugby family &#8212; our student-athletes, our alumni, the Black and Gold Society and all of the extended network of Slug Rugby supporters,&#8221; said head coach Jeremy Sanford. &#8220;Rugby was the first intercollegiate sport played on campus. That pioneering rugby team embraced the Banana Slug as their mascot and in doing so imprinted both rugby and our beloved, tenacious, gritty mollusk mascot on the nascent DNA of our campus! It's a remarkable legacy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Rugby funds from Giving Day will be used to buy equipment and training gear, travel across California and Nevada to compete in competitions, host tournaments on campus, record and broadcast matches, engage in preseason and postseason matches, and compete at the highest possible level. Funds will also allow for increased player recruitment and retention by decreasing the financial barriers to participation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Giving Day set our student athletes up for a successful season,&#8221; Sanford added. &#8220;We are grateful for the support.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center for Agroecology: UCSC Farm closed off the day with the highest earning of any project with more than $124,000 raised. The funds from the project will be used to repair the 30-year-old fence surrounding the farm, which protects the crops, and will support the overall program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are immensely grateful for the overwhelming support we received during Giving Day,&#8221; said Center for Agroecology Executive Director Darryl Wong. &#8220;We extend our heartfelt thanks to all who made this possible. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds we raised will support our research, extension, and education programs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8203;&#8203;Since its founding in 1971, the 30-acre farm has hosted training programs, workshops, research projects, classes, and internships for students, faculty, community members, and aspiring farmers. For the past six years, the Center for Agroecology has grown food on the UCSC Farm for students facing food insecurity, donating more than 20,000 pounds of organic produce to student food pantries and other Basic Needs programs each year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event ultimately provided valuable funding for each of the 160 projects involved in Giving Day 2023.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"None of this would have been possible without the incredible support and dedication of our community,&#8221; Hurley said. &#8220;These contributions, both big and small, have made a profound difference in the lives of our students. We thank all who donated for being a part of this momentous Giving Day. Together, we are shaping a brighter future for UC Santa Cruz."&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b67566da8072704637945e91100bbc89"><name>new-humanities-faculty-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC Humanities Division welcomes 11 new faculty members</title><summary>The Humanities Division is proud to announce the recent hires of 11 outstanding new faculty members whose disciplines range from Critical Race &amp; Ethnic Studies (CRES) to the History of Consciousness, Philosophy, Languages and Applied Linguistics.</summary><start-date>1699914000000</start-date><display-name>humanitiesfacultyhires</display-name><path>/2023/11/new-humanities-faculty-dw</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/new-humanities-faculty-dw</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1699573229255</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1700071219988</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Linguistics</value><value>History of Consciousness</value><value>History</value><value>Philosophy</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/kriti-sharma.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/kriti-sharma.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kriti-sharma.jpg</name><display-name>kriti-sharma.jpg</display-name><file-size>40777</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/humanitiesbldgthumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/11/humanitiesbldgthumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>humanitiesbldgthumb.jpg</name><display-name>humanitiesbldgthumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22792</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Kriti Sharma</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/jennifer-mogannam.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/11/jennifer-mogannam.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jennifer-mogannam.jpg</name><display-name>jennifer-mogannam.jpg</display-name><file-size>92501</file-size><width>396</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Jennifer Mogannam.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These excellent scholars and teachers are coming to the University of California, Santa Cruz at a time when our division has been using the Humanities as a lens to explore anti-colonial movements, the struggle for human rights and civil liberties, and the ethical implications of development in the scientific and high-tech realms, along with critical disability studies," said Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder. &#8220;These new faculty hires reinforce and expand our mission to find humanistic answers to the world&#8217;s most pressing challenges."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research and teaching interests of </span><strong>Maria Puig de la Bellacasa, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor, History of Consciousness, connect science and technology studies, feminist theory, and the environmental humanities. Grounded in contemporary continental philosophy and constructivist and process theory, her earlier work was on feminist epistemologies and the politics of knowledge. She is currently working on a new monograph,&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Name for World is Soil</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, examining ongoing formations of ecological cultures around changes in human-soils relations.</span></p>

Lewis dining hall, giving faculty, staff, and students a new dining experience to enjoy on campus this fall. Helmed by chef Diego Leiva, the bustling kitchen is turning out entrees like pan-seared salmon with mango Calabrian chili salsa and black rice, and grilled top sirloin steak with gremolata.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lifelong foodie with roots in El Salvador, Leiva has been a Santa Cruz local since 2011, and brings a wealth of on-the-ground experience from his years working on the UC Santa Cruz Dining team. The menu reflects his love of combining food cultures, and the vibe is upscale casual.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to entrees, expect to see a selection of salads, soups, starters, gourmet pizzas and burgers, and several vegan options. Finish your meal with a delectable dessert like caramel cheesecake, tiramisu, or sorbet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bistro uses a hybrid service model for a streamlined experience. After ordering and paying at the counter, hosts seat customers and servers bring customers their meals.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a venue managed by UCSC Dining, the Bistro does not serve alcoholic beverages, and staff do not accept tips. Bistro servers are students who gain real-world work experience, strengthening their skills in communication, customer service, and teamwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University Center already serves as a hub of activity at UC Santa Cruz, with its spectacular setting among tall redwood trees, elegant rotunda, meeting rooms, and cozy fireplace. With University Center Bistro now open, there is even more reason to visit.&#160;</span></p>

You already face innumerable pressures both private and shared, and have continued your work and education in the face of global tragedies that should be unthinkable, but sadly are not. As our community members seek to have their voices heard and to engage in protest, it is crucial not to let the overwhelming nature of the pain we feel cause us to abandon our obligations to each other.</span><br/><br/><span>As a campus with only two entrances and limited roadways, we depend on our community to promote safety and accessibility. We rely on individual members to act in ways that promote the safety and inclusion of others, and to encourage others to uphold our community responsibilities.</span><br/><br/><span>On Thursday, unfortunately, some disregarded these responsibilities by blocking the main entrance of our campus for hours, preventing ingress and egress, closing the intersection, and creating unsafe situations where drivers were waved into the intersection by protesters and then surrounded. Stepping into an active intersection without coordination to safely stop or divert traffic created an unacceptable safety risk to not only the motorists but to those who were protesting. Blocking the entrance to campus and the city street are not protected by the First Amendment. It is dangerous, a policy violation, and illegal.</span><br/><br/><span>These actions also contradict the values to which our community commits and on which it depends for our collective well-being. When a group chooses to block the entrance and the street, they are disadvantaging some of our most vulnerable community members. What do these actions say to those with mobility limitations, those who rely on buses for transportation, or those who are solely responsible for childcare? For many, the campus is their home, the place where they receive food and healthcare. I ask everyone to consider the fact that the most harm is caused to those who are already vulnerable when you prevent people from entering and exiting campus.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>The impacts also went beyond UC Santa Cruz. The streets surrounding campus are the jurisdiction of the City of Santa Cruz and many families depend on them to go to work, care for their family needs and much more. Students, faculty or staff who choose to block an entrance or otherwise disrupt normal activity on our campus will be held accountable under applicable policy or law.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>Protest and free speech are rights that we protect on this campus. Blocking city streets and denying access to campus is not. Accessing the campus freely is a right we need to collectively protect. We must work together as a community to ensure that we do not prevent access to food, housing, healthcare, and education for those without the ability to hike or bike up the hill, or those who rely on the bus.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>As a university, we must support, uphold, and protect the rights of everyone in our campus community. This means both ensuring our community members can demonstrate in a way that elevates issues they care so deeply about while also ensuring such activities do not infringe on the rights of others. With your help, we can do both.</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cb1afb3e8072704637945e9152b8e1eb"><name>science-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC doctoral graduate wins prestigious Science &amp; SciLifeLab Prize for Young Scientists</title><summary>Jessica Kendall-Bar, who received her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology last year from UC Santa Cruz with co-advisors Terrie Williams and Dan Costa, was named a recipient of the prestigious Science &amp; SciLifeLab Prize for Young Scientists for her research on elephant seal sleep habits while they are at sea.</summary><start-date>1700161200000</start-date><display-name>Science Prize</display-name><path>/2023/11/science-prize</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/science-prize</link><created-by>esmith16</created-by><created-on>1699919624991</created-on><last-modified-by>esmith16</last-modified-by><last-modified>1699919624991</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Coastal Science and Policy</value><value>Ocean Sciences</value><value>Science Communication Program</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Academics</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Elisa Smith</name><title></title><phone/><email>esmith16@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-400.png</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-400.png</link><site>news</site><name>02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-400.png</name><display-name>02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-400.png</display-name><file-size>223414</file-size><width>400</width><height>550</height></image><image-alt>Graphic of seals asleep at sea.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-thumb.png</name><display-name>02_07_sleepatsea_graphic03-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>12974</file-size><width>80</width><height>110</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Graphic of seals asleep at sea.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data-driven graphic showing sleeping postures every 20 seconds and accompanying 30-second segments of EEG traces in the background.

<p>The Science &amp; SciLifeLab Prize is an international prize awarded by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the journal <em>Science</em> to early career scientists for their outstanding thesis research in the life sciences. As a category winner in Ecology &amp; Environment, Kendall-Bar had her prize-winning essay recently <a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl4885" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published by <em>Science</em>;</a> she received a $10,000 prize and will soon be headed to the Nobel Prize week in Stockholm to present her research at The Royal Academy of Sciences, where the Nobel Prize in Physics and Chemistry are announced.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for the opportunity to meet the other prize winners and attend the Nobel award ceremony in Sweden in December,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said. &#8220;I am especially excited to see Katalin Karik&#243; receive her much-deserved Nobel award for laying the scientific groundwork for the mRNA vaccine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kendall-Bar&#8217;s research, which was first <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0566" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published in <em>Science</em></a> in April, was the first time scientists had recorded brain activity in a free-ranging, wild marine mammal. Her research found that while elephant seals may spend 10 hours a day sleeping on the beach during the breeding season, they sleep less than 2 hours a day in the months they are foraging at sea.&#160;</p>
<p>To conduct her research, Kendall-Bar <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40317-022-00287-x" rel="noopener" target="_blank">designed a new submersible system</a> for electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of wild northern elephant seals. Her research found that they sleep bilaterally during deep, 30-minute dives, often spiraling downward while fast asleep. She transformed her data into data-driven animations (featured by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/science/elephant-seals-sleep-dive.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/04/elephant-seal-animals-varied-sleep-habits-survival/673797/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a></em>) of underwater physiology and behavior <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/VISAP52981.2021.00007" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using a custom visualization pipeline</a> to identify a distinctive biomechanical signature for sleep.</p>
<p>Kendall-Bar wrote an algorithm to estimate sleep from 334 time-depth records, creating a range-wide &#8220;sleepscape.&#8221; This unparalleled sleep duration flexibility challenges assumptions of baseline mammalian sleep requirements with implications for understanding sleep deprivation.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;These &#8216;sleepscapes&#8217; can help guide the protection and management of critical resting habitats for marine animals,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said. &#8220;I am passionate about using data-driven visualizations to connect us to otherwise invisible underwater ecosystems.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Kendall-Bar is a co-investigator for a new intercampus project supported by UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/cccr/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Center for Coastal Climate Resilience</a> (CCCR) with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and San Diego Supercomputer Center. The work is merging high-performance game engine tools with coastal flooding models to make data-driven digital twins that help visualize climate risks and the role of nature in reducing those risks. This work is helping decisionmakers recognize the value of nature as <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/10/coral-reef-resolution.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critical national infrastructure,</a> with recent <a href="https://www.vi.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Establishing-Natural-Infrastructure-in-the-USVI-EXO-533.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Executive Orders and Policy Resolutions</a> from the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the <a href="https://www.coralreef.gov/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">U.S. Coral Reef Task Force.&#160;</a></p>
<p>Kendall-Bar is working with scientists at <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a> to produce data-driven visualizations to communicate long-term climate shifts with Argo float data that will premiere at the Ocean Pavilion at the upcoming COP28 in Dubai. Kendall-Bar has also recently launched a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-animation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">freely-available Data-Driven Animation Coursera course</a> to train scientists and artists to tell similar data-driven climate stories. The course was developed with support from the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program and Burroughs Welcome Fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to advance innovative solutions for building coastal resilience, especially through effective science communication and collaboration across disciplines and sectors,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said. &#8220;It is more important than ever that we tell clear and compelling stories about the intersection of humans and the natural world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessie is a truly unique scientist with the ability to pair extraordinary scientific skills with exceptional artistic vision. It has been a pleasure for the Center to partner with her on communicating climate risks and solutions,&#8221; said CCCR Director Mike Beck.</p>
<p>Kendall-Bar is currently a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. Her research investigates the resilience and precarity of ocean ecosystems through neurophysiology, signal processing, and advanced data visualization.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ceb143f8807270460b88db569e9e84c2"><name>data-driven-animation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New open access course – data-driven animation for science communication</title><summary>The Teaching &amp; Learning Center at UC Santa Cruz is delighted to announce that Dr. Jessica Kendall-Bar has created an open access version of her Data-Driven Animation for Science Communication course, which is now freely available on the Coursera platform. </summary><start-date>1699948800000</start-date><path>/2023/11/data-driven-animation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/data-driven-animation</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1699979805669</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1699979890160</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/unnamed.png</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/unnamed.png</link><site>news</site><name>unnamed.png</name><display-name>unnamed.png</display-name><file-size>264072</file-size><width>500</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span>Instructor Dr. Jessica Kendall-Bar lays out the 10 sessions of the 5-week Coursera course on the interactive Learning Glass at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Teaching &amp; Learning Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UC Santa Cruz is delighted to announce that Dr. Jessica Kendall-Bar has created an open access version of her </span><a href="https://coursera.org/learn/data-driven-animation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data-Driven Animation for Science Communication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> course, which is now freely available on the </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursera </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on the success of the first Student Climate Conference in Nov 2022, &#8220;Beyond the Bullshit: Waking Up a Warming World,&#8221; this year&#8217;s conference organizers reached out to sister UCs and other local colleges and universities, like Stanford University and Cabrillo College. Even a student from the University of British Columbia will be presenting a paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theme this year is &#8220;Shifting the Story: Climate Vulnerability, Social Solidarity, Environmental Justice.&#8221;&#160; The keynote speaker is UC Berkeley&#8217;s </span><a href="https://ashiaajani.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashia Ajani</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160; Conference organizers are showcasing papers, academic posters, and art centered around climate justice, saying that &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time to call the climate crisis what it is: the legacy of racism, colonialism, and neoliberal capitalism that values profits over people and people of color and other social minorities less than most.&#8221; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the conference&#8217;s</span><a href="http://bit.ly/CliCon23CALL"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Call for Papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the goal of this conference is to &#8220;shift the story&#8221;&#160; towards &#8220;transformative change&#8221; and &#8220;examples of/possibilities for </span><strong>intersectional collaboration </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and opportunities created for and by a new generation of climate/social justice leaders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Climate Coalition, whose members now number nearly 700 UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, and staff, was founded in 2021 to push for campus decarbonization and more climate education. It is a member of the system-wide </span><a href="https://ucgreennewdealcoalition.net/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Green New Deal Coalition,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which itself includes nearly 1000 members from all ten UC campuses advocating a &#8220;UC Green New Deal&#8221; </span><a href="https://ucgreennewdealcoalition.net/index.php/what-is-the-green-new-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policy platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, centered on campus decarbonization, climate education, and environmental justice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the Nov 2022 First Annual Student Climate Conference, the UC Santa Cruz Climate Coalition&#8217;s past events and achievements include an open-to-the-public Earth Day 2022 </span><a href="http://bit.ly/EDTeach"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teach-In</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, speaker sponsorships, campus hikes and movie nights, and tireless advocacy to push UC Santa Cruz to be a true climate leader, one that not only advocates climate justice, but also makes its own campus operations and financial sources rigorously fossil-free. They have recently been heartened by the announcement by UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive that UC Santa Cruz would achieve 95% decarbonization of its Scope 1 (primary power) emissions by 2030 &#8211; a goal long sought by the UC Santa Cruz Climate Coalition and their allies.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cf045319807270460b88db56651e0929"><name>2023-united-way-campaign-underway</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> UCSC’s 2023 United Way Employee Campaign now underway</title><summary>2023 UCSC United Way campaign has officially launched.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am excited to officially launch this year&#8217;s</span><a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/ucscunited"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UC Santa Cruz employee campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of United Way of Santa Cruz County. The 2023 campaign - United in Purpose - centers the increased impact we can have when we come together, united in a common goal. Through diverse programs, United Way promotes equity, creates opportunity and improves lives and communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the generous support of donors and advocates like you, United Way of Santa Cruz recently launched two new efforts.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOEOweHEV98"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United for Youth Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pairs middle and high school students with adults to co-create programs to address their emerging needs. The </span><a href="https://211santacruzcounty.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">211 program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects people to basic needs and resources including housing, food, health and mental health care, transportation, legal assistance and much more.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Giving is easy</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a small donation makes a positive impact in the local Santa Cruz community. Every dollar raised here, stays here, and anyone, including members of our UC Santa Cruz community, can take advantage of the programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you donated through payroll deduction during last year&#8217;s United Way campaign, your annual donation will automatically roll over into the 2023 campaign. Your donation amount will remain the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're a new donor or a donor considering increasing your gift, you can do so by creating a new pledge. You can choose a deduction per pay period or a one-time contribution. The campaign runs through the month of November. Just follow these three easy steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on the UCSC donation page: </span><a href="http://ucsc.edu/unitedway"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ucsc.edu/unitedway&#160;</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill out the Workplace Pledge Card at the bottom of the page.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose either Payroll Deduction, Pledge by Card, Check or Continue my Giving</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your continued support of the United Way campaign and for helping to create a thriving, healthy and safe Santa Cruz County for all.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly awarded funding will propel a data-informed and equity-centered implementation year. During this phase, the </span><a href="https://www.centralcoastk16collab.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Coast K-16 Regional Collaborative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will work closely with regional partners to bring about transformative changes, dismantling structural barriers and creating equitable education-to-employment opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This grant will enhance educational pathways throughout our six county Central Coast region and strengthen UC Santa Cruz efforts to build robust bridges between our educational programs and career opportunities, ensuring that our students are well-prepared for the demands of the job market,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;We are excited to expand our commitment to providing a comprehensive and relevant education for the benefit of both our students and the California economy."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Vice Chancellor of Educational Partnerships and Chief Campus Outreach Officer Maria Rocha-Ruiz will serve as Principal Investigator for the award, following a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/12/cerf-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one year planning effort </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">across six counties with more than 50 collaborating institutions. &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Central Coast K-16 Regional Collaborative, established in 2023, is a collective impact initiative of K-12, Community College, California State University, University of California, and industry partners who are coming together to address long-standing educational and economic inequities in the region.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaborative spans six counties &#8212; Santa Cruz, San Benito, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. UC Santa Cruz, Cabrillo College, UC Santa Barbara, and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, provide leadership and function as the operational backbone for the collaborative.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work is supported by WestEd&#8217;s Postsecondary Education &amp; Career Mobility team that brings expertise in facilitation, research, postsecondary access and success, and career pathways to provide critical infrastructure and expertise to the Central Coast K-16 Regional Collaborative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaborative plays a pivotal role in a statewide strategy, aimed at fortifying regional economies, refining education-to-career pathways, and ensuring that education, vocational, and workforce programs collaboratively widen access to education and employment opportunities for the region&#8217;s historically marginalized students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaborative&#8217;s efforts span from early childhood education to adult learning, with a steadfast commitment to promoting college and career readiness as a cornerstone of community growth and vitality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I firmly believe that a robust K-16 collaborative initiative in Central Coast California is the key to unlocking the full potential of our region's educational ecosystem,&#8221; said Michael Gutierrez, Hartnell College Superintendent/President. &#8220;By bridging the gap between K-12 schools, community colleges, and universities, we empower students with a seamless pathway to success, ensuring that every learner has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to our community's growth and prosperity."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program provides funding to enhance or create collaborative efforts between the University of California system, the California State University system, California Community Colleges, K-12 school districts, and workforce partners. It represents a key component of a statewide strategy to bolster regional economies and ensure that education, vocational, and workforce programs work in harmony to strengthen equitable education-to-workforce pathways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz's outstanding track record in developing innovative programs and initiatives, closely aligned with the state's workforce requirements, positions the university as a prime contender for the "More Jobs, Better Careers" program. With this grant, UC Santa Cruz continues its mission to propel regional economic growth and success by equipping students with the skills, knowledge, and opportunities necessary for long-term career success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Our collaborative efforts prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion at the forefront of our decision-making,&#8221; said Dr. Consuelo Hernandez-Williams, Associate Superintendent, Student Services, Ventura County Office of Education. &#8220;This commitment also guarantees that career education is closely aligned with the demands of the job market, ensuring students have straightforward and smooth paths to both postsecondary education and a successful career."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is among the select institutions benefiting from this substantial funding, aimed at bridging the gap between education and employment prospects while creating sustainable pathways for students pursuing fulfilling careers. The grant highlights UC Santa Cruz's dedication to providing students with a well-rounded, career-focused education, bolstering its role as an educational leader dedicated to preparing students for the ever-evolving California job market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz </span><a href="https://epc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational Partnership Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EPC) in the Division of Undergraduate Education will serve as the fiscal agent and operational lead for this initiative, in partnership with the Student Success and Equity office in the Division of Student Affairs and Success, which includes the Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) team.</span></p>

It combines several cutting-edge technologies and scientific objectives to advance our understanding of the cosmos and the potential for alien life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lick Observatory's positioning in the Northern Hemisphere enables observation of a substantial portion of the Milky Way galaxy where there are a multitude of stars, billions of potential sites for life. Making Lick Observatory a perfect home for PANOSETI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary repurposing of the Carnegie Dual Astrograph dome for the PANOSETI program was part of the first stage; the project is now moving into its second phase; observational monitoring - data collection. The team also added a new small dome to Lick Observatory at the site of the now removed Barnard House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To bolster that effort UC San Diego&#8217;s lead PI Shelley Wright is making plans to raise funds to construct two dedicated PANOSETI sites with 10&#8217;s of telescopes at each site at Lick Observatory. This dedicated PANOSETI program will be taking images over thousands of square degrees of sky maximizing the chances of detecting a rare interstellar communication. In addition to PANOSETI&#8217;s primary technosignature mission, the extensive sky coverage allows for the monitoring of other astrophysical transient events, like fast radio bursts (FRBs) or high-energy astrophysical sources .&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wright explains, &#8220;PANOSETI is designed to take a picture every nanosecond - that&#8217;s a billion images per second! We are aiming to detect a signal in that brief snapshot of the entire night sky.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced fiber optic technology is being used on site to ensure the precise timing on the nanosecond scale. Dr. Dan Werthimer at UC Berkeley and Prof. Paul Horowitz at Harvard - PANOSETI co-investigators - have been aiding in developing the technology to allow such high-precision timing. This is crucial to accurately detect and verify the signals and their location on-sky between multiple facilities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some of the greatest discoveries in physics and astronomy come from looking at the universe in a brand new way.&#160; I can&#8217;t wait to see what we find by looking at time scales of nano-seconds&#8221;, remarked&#160; Matthew Shetrone, UC Observatories Deputy Director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PANOSETI project involves active participation from undergraduate students who remotely operate the equipment from UC San Diego, fostering education and research opportunities for the next generation of UC Observatories astronomers and scientists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This multi-institutional collaboration puts PANOSETI at the forefront of technosignature research, including the potential for unraveling new astrophysical discoveries. This enhances Lick Observatory's position as a scientific site that continues to contribute and broaden our knowledge of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your support for Panoramic SETI holds immense value as we endeavor to enhance our capabilities in the realm of new discoveries. </span><a href="https://panoseti.ucsd.edu/give/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://panoseti.ucsd.edu/give/index.html</span></a></p>

Now, his <a href="https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">open source code library</a>, called &#8220;snnTorch,&#8221; has surpassed 100,000 downloads and is used in a wide variety of projects, from NASA satellite tracking efforts to semiconductor companies optimizing chips for AI.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>A <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10242251">new paper</a> published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the IEEE</em> documents the coding library but also is intended to be a candid educational resource for students and any other programmers interested in learning about brain-inspired AI.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting because it shows people are interested in the brain, and that people have identified that neural networks are really inefficient compared to the brain,&#8221; said Eshraghian, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. &#8220;People are concerned about the environmental impact [of the costly power demands] of neural networks and large language models, and so this is a very plausible direction forward.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Building snnTorch</strong><br/><br/>Spiking neural networks emulate the brain and biological systems to process information more efficiently. The brain&#8217;s neurons are at rest until there is a piece of information for them to process, which causes their activity to spike. Similarly, a spiking neural network only begins processing data when there is an input into the system, rather than constantly processing data like traditional neural networks.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We want to take all the benefits of the brain and its power efficiency and smush them into the functionality of artificial intelligence &#8211; so taking the best of both worlds,&#8221; Eshraghian said.&#160;<br/><br/>Eshraghian began building the code for a spiking neural network in Python as a passion project during the pandemic, somewhat as a method to teach himself the coding language Python. A chip designer by training, he became interested in learning to code when considering that computing chips could be optimized for power efficiency by co-designing the software and the hardware to ensure they best complement each other.&#160;<br/><br/>Now, snnTorch is being used by thousands of programmers around the world on a variety of projects, supporting everything from NASA&#8217;s satellite tracking projects to major chip designers such as Graphcore.<br/><br/>While building the Python library, Eshraghian created code documentation and educational materials, which came naturally to him in the process of teaching himself the coding language. The documents, tutorials, and interactive coding notebooks he made later exploded in the community and became the first point of entry for many people learning about the topics of neuromorphic engineering and spiking neural networks, which he sees as one of the major reasons that his library became so popular.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>An honest resource</strong><br/><br/>Knowing that these educational materials could be very valuable to the growing community of computer scientists and beyond who were interested in the field, Eshraghian began compiling his extensive documentation into a paper, which has now been published in the Proceedings of the IEEE, a leading computing journal.<br/><br/>The paper acts as a companion to the snnTorch code library and is structured like a tutorial, and an opinionated one at that, discussing uncertainty among brain-inspired deep learning researchers and offering a perspective on the future of the field. Eshraghian said that the paper is intentionally upfront to its readers that the field of neuromorphic computing is evolving and unsettled in an effort to save students the frustration of trying to find the theoretical basis for code decision-making that the research community doesn&#8217;t even understand.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This paper is painfully honest, because students deserve that,&#8221; Eshraghian said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of things that we do in deep learning, and we just don't know why they work. A lot of times we want to claim that we did something intentionally, and we published because we went through a series of rigorous experiments, but here we say just: this is what works best and we have no idea why.&#8221;<br/><br/>The paper contains blocks of code, a format unusual to typical research papers. These code blocks are sometimes accompanied by explanations that certain areas may be vastly unsettled, but provide insight into why researchers think certain approaches may be successful. Eshraghian said he has seen a positive reception to this honest approach in the community, and has even been told that the paper is being used in onboarding materials at neuromorphic hardware startups.<br/><br/>&#8220;I don't want my research to put people through the same pain I went through,&#8221; he said.<br/><br/><strong>Learning from and about the brain&#160;</strong><br/><br/>The paper offers a perspective on how researchers in the field might navigate some of the limitations of brain-inspired deep learning that stem from the fact that overall, our understanding of how the brain functions and processes information is quite limited.&#160;<br/><br/>For AI researchers to move toward more brain-like learning mechanisms for their deep learning models, they need to identify the correlations and discrepancies between deep learning and biology, Eshraghian said. One of these key differences is that brains can&#8217;t survey all of the data they&#8217;ve ever inputted in the way that AI models can, and instead focus on the real-time data that comes their way, which could offer opportunities for enhanced energy efficiency.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Brains aren't time machines, they can't go back &#8212; all your memories are pushed forward as you experience the world, so training and processing are coupled together,&#8221; Eshraghian said. &#8220;One of the things that I make a big deal of in the paper is how we can apply learning in real time.&#8221;<br/><br/>Another area of exploration in the paper is a fundamental concept in neuroscience that states that neurons that fire together are wired together &#8211; meaning when two neurons are triggered to send out a signal at the same time, the pathway between the two neurons is strengthened. However, the ways in which the brain learns on an organ-wide scale still remains mysterious.&#160;<br/><br/>The &#8220;fire together, wired together" concept has been traditionally seen as in opposition to deep learning&#8217;s model training method known as backpropagation, but Eshraghian suggests that these processes may be complementary, opening up new areas of exploration for the field.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Eshraghian is also excited about working with cerebral organoids, which are models of brain tissue grown from stem cells, to learn more about how the brain processes information. He&#8217;s currently collaborating with biomolecular engineering researchers in the UCSC Genomics Institute&#8217;s <a href="https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu/">Braingeneers group</a> to explore these questions with organoid models. This is a unique opportunity for UC Santa Cruz engineers to incorporate &#8220;wetware&#8221; &#8211; a term referring to biological models for computing research &#8212; into the software/hardware co-design paradigm that is prevalent in the field. The snnTorch code could even provide a platform for simulating organoids, which can be difficult to maintain in the lab.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;[The Braingeneers] are building the biological instruments and tools that we can use to get a better feel for how learning can happen, and how that might translate in order to make deep learning more efficient,&#8221; Eshraghian said.<br/><br/><strong>Brain-inspired learning at UCSC and beyond</strong><br/><br/>Eshraghian is now using the concepts developed in his library and the recent paper in his class on neuromorphic computing at UC Santa Cruz called &#8220;Brain-Inspired Deep Learning.&#8221; Undergraduate and graduate students across a range of academic disciplines are taking the class to learn the basics of deep learning and complete a project in which they write their own tutorial for, and potentially contributing to, snnTorch.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;It's not just kind of coming out of the class with an exam or getting an A plus, it's now making a contribution to something, and being able to say that you've done something tangible,&#8221; Eshraghian said.&#160;<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the preprint version of the recent IEEE paper continues to receive contributions from researchers around the world, a reflection of the dynamic, open-source nature of the field. A <a href="https://source.wustl.edu/2023/11/research-network-to-focus-on-ai-integrated-circuits/">new NSF grant</a> he is a co-principal investigator on will support students&#8217; ability to attend the month-long Telluride Neuromorphic &amp; Cognition Engineering workshop.&#160;</p>
<p>Eshraghian is collaborating with people to push the field in a number of ways, from making biological discoveries about the brain, to pushing the limits of neuromorphic chips to handle low-power AI workloads, to facilitating collaboration to bring the spiking neural network-style of computing to other domains such as natural physics.&#160;<br/><br/>Discord and Slack channels dedicated to discussing the spiking neural network code support a thriving environment of collaboration across industry and academia. Eshraghian even recently came across a job posting that listed proficiency in snnTorch as a desired quality.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d95779b880727046012105606e9adefc"><name>peter-gelpi</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC alumnus at the forefront of humanitarian efforts in Ukraine</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Peter Gelpi is at the forefront of efforts to feed Ukrainians displaced by the war against Russia. </summary><start-date>1700157600000</start-date><display-name>peter-gelpi</display-name><path>/2023/11/peter-gelpi</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/peter-gelpi</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1700158470563</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1700246411204</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/20220902_111351-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/20220902_111351-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>20220902_111351-1.jpg</name><display-name>20220902_111351-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>87113</file-size><width>450</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/petergelpithumbnail1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/petergelpithumbnail1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>petergelpithumbnail1.jpg</name><display-name>petergelpithumbnail1.jpg</display-name><file-size>20034</file-size><width>80</width><height>60</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Peter Gelpi (left) stirs soup at the kitchen in Chernivtsi.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/whatsapp-image-2023-05-17-at-12.15.38-am-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/whatsapp-image-2023-05-17-at-12.15.38-am-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>whatsapp-image-2023-05-17-at-12.15.38-am-1.jpg</name><display-name>whatsapp-image-2023-05-17-at-12.15.38-am-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>84872</file-size><width>450</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Ukranian volunteers prepare meals at the refugee camp.</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/whatsapp-image-2023-06-19-at-1.39.15-am-1-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/whatsapp-image-2023-06-19-at-1.39.15-am-1-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>whatsapp-image-2023-06-19-at-1.39.15-am-1-1.jpg</name><display-name>whatsapp-image-2023-06-19-at-1.39.15-am-1-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>76069</file-size><width>450</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Ukranian volunteer hands refugee soup.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Peter Gelpi helps feed over a thousand displaced Ukrainians every day</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumnus Peter Gelpi (Crown &#8217;77, physics) has been on the frontlines of humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine since June 2022. His primary objective, alongside his peers, is to build fully equipped and operational kitchens in towns ravaged by the war and serve meals to displaced Ukrainians.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering with a non-profit organization based in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romania, Peter Gelpi has aided in the formation of three operational kitchens, one in Chernivtsi, feeding upwards of 1,000 civilians a day, and two in Toretsk, feeding around 100 civilians each every day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew from day one that I had to participate,&#8221; Gelpi said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sit on the sidelines. And I didn&#8217;t know how I was going to help until I was there. I knew I couldn&#8217;t live my life and say that I watched as this unfolded.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gelpi spends between a couple of weeks to months between Ukraine and Romania before returning home to Seattle. But even when he is in the United States, Gelpi is working to raise funds to further the work being done in Ukraine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has fundraised over $50,000 for food and kitchen supplies since June 2022.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to support these people,&#8221; Gelpi says, &#8220;and to get them back to their lives.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Chernivtsi&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since he arrived in Europe in June 2022, Gelpi has spent the majority of his time in Chernivtsi, a city in Southwest Ukraine hundreds of miles away from the war front. The city has a population of around 260,000 and hosts an additional 115,000 internally displaced (IDP) Ukrainians living in spare rooms, garages, abandoned buildings, tents, and other means of shelter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chernivtsi is one of the only cities in Ukraine that remains untouched by missiles, but the city isn&#8217;t resting. According to the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/world/asia/chernivtsi-western-ukraine-aid.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Chernivtsi and villages nearby are building dune buggies for the front lines, providing homes to thousands of displaced Ukrainian civilians, shipping supplies to the east, and using their proximity to Poland and Romania to bring in more. Gelpi emphasizes that although Chernivtsi is further away from the frontline, the city is still very much a part of the war.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On almost a daily basis, we have air raid sirens, indicating drones or missiles entering Ukrainian air space,&#8221; Gelpi wrote in his daily journal. &#8220;Early in the war, one flew directly over our kitchen and the city but was shot down by a man-portable air-defense system, the debris landing harmlessly in the surrounding countryside.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early on, the kitchen was located in the courtyard of a Chernivtsi city council administrative building. In August 2023, the kitchen was relocated to a new modular housing settlement for IDP a mile outside the center of Chernivtsi holding around 1,000 Ukrainians. The kitchen feeds everyone in the refugee camp community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We staff our kitchen in Chernivtsi with individuals from the community of displaced people we&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">support, providing them with regular income and help with accommodations,&#8221; Gelpi says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in Chernivtsi, Gelpi drives across the Romanian/Ukrainian border, delivering food to the tent kitchen in central Chernivtsi, and then helps prepare and serve daily meals. He helps procure perishable food and materials from the local community and sources non-perishable food donated by NGOs. Gelpi says that more recently, it has become increasingly difficult to gather materials from NGOs, and most of the food is now sourced from local shops.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gelpi does most of the fundraising to keep supplies flowing to the kitchens in Chernivtsi and Toretsk.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Toretsk</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past couple of months Gelpi&#8217;s focus has shifted from Chernivtsi to Toretsk.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The people we have been supporting in Chernivtsi are becoming more independent,&#8221; Gelpi said. &#8220;Some have found work, nominal earnings, and access to their own kitchens. We are reducing the size of our daily meals and redirecting our efforts/supplies to Toretsk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toretsk, located in Eastern Ukraine, sits just miles outside a current Ukrainian military offensive. The Eastern Ukraine region has seen more violence than any other part of the country.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gelpi is currently raising additional funds to support the two kitchens in Toretsk and build more. He has purchased a sprinter van to aid in transport, hired Ukrainians to build stoves, and purchased clothing, more kitchen equipment, and Christmas gifts he plans to deliver the first week of December.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Peter Gelpi&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gelpi graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1977 with a B.A. in physics and earned an MBA in 1987 from the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says that his background in business management has been critical to his humanitarian operations in Ukraine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to his volunteer efforts in Ukraine, Peter served as the Vice President of Programs and Operations at FIRST Washington from 2017-2019. In this capacity, he played a key role in providing young people with hands-on learning experiences that inspired them to pursue careers in STEM fields, demonstrating his commitment to shaping the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Gelpi made significant contributions to the healthcare industry. In 2007, he founded Clarity Health Services, which provides innovative care coordination solutions. He was the CEO of Clarity Health Services from 2007 to 2012.&#160;<span>After the sale of Clarity, Peter left the for-profit world behind and took up leadership and board positions in a variety of non-profit organizations focused on robotics and STEM education (FIRST), urban reforestation (Forterra) and jazz music programs in underserved inner city schools, (Seattle Repertory Jazz Orchestra). He also served on the faculty of Bellevue College, teaching an introductory certification course on the healthcare market.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UC Santa Cruz, Gelpi played rugby, is still heavily connected to his former teammates, and often aids the current team in their endeavors. Every year, Gelpi helps host the Rugby Alumni Reunion, where alumni dating back to the first-ever rugby team at UCSC reconnect and play a match against the current teams. He was heavily involved in outreach to alumni for Giving Day 2023, using his fundraising skills to support his alma mater, and helped raise over $46,000.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Looking Forward&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gelpi plans on returning to Ukraine at the end of November to continue aiding in humanitarian operations. In the meantime, he has hosted fundraising events in Seattle, Portland, Washington D.C., London, and New York to raise more money and awareness.&#160;</span></p>

<p>Dear Campus Community,&#160;</p>
<p>This fall has been a difficult one, as the impact of the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict has rippled outward to our community and so many others. University of California President Michael Drake at Wednesday&#8217;s UC Regents meeting addressed the hurt and tensions that many UC students, staff and faculty are experiencing as we collectively process this tragedy.</p>
<p>As President Drake said, we owe it to everyone in our community to do all we can &#8220;to create a safe and welcoming living, learning, and working environment, and to create educational spaces where we can all find factual information, guidance, support, and practical tools to better understand and respond to what is happening around us.&#8221; With that as the goal, he announced the creation of a systemwide Office of Civil Rights that will provide guidance and support to all 10 campuses on issues related to protecting civil rights. He also pledged $7 million in systemwide funding for additional emergency mental health resources to students, faculty, and staff; new program development intended to inform and improve our shared public discourse; and training for UC leadership, staff, and faculty to ensure they can proactively address ongoing and emerging issues in higher education. President Drake&#8217;s remarks can be found in their entirety <a alias="online" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-michael-v-drake-md-opening-remarks-november-15-regents-meeting" style="color: #003c6c; text-decoration: underline;" title="online">online</a>.</p>
There is no easy path to easing the conflicts that have developed at the UC and campuses nationwide in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack and the ongoing Israeli military response. It will require hard, deliberate work on all of our parts. I believe President Drake&#8217;s plan gives us important first steps. &#160;&#160;
<p>Another important step to healing is taking time to express gratitude for those who have supported and sustained us over the years. This is all the more important in challenging times. I know that I will feel especially grateful this year when surrounded by loved ones. I hope the coming fall break (Nov. 22-26) provides you some well-deserved time off to use as best sustains you and your communities. Safe travels for those who will spend the break off campus. For those remaining on campus, consider attending the annual Harvest Meal from 1-4 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 23, at the College Nine/John R. Lewis Dining Hall. The meal is hosted and organized by UCSC Dining, with support from the Dean of Students Office and Basic Needs Team. All students, faculty, staff and their guests are welcome. An <a alias="RSVP" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesd7j6Z1qWrPXDf7LMTC0-q3MSzbFuFqfnIr0yP4GF8ytHtw/viewform" style="color: #003c6c; text-decoration: underline;" title="RSVP">RSVP</a> is required by 5 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 21, so our dining team knows how much food to prepare. We look forward to celebrating with you.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003c6c; font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 22px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;">Giving Day a resounding success</h2>
<p><a alias="Thank you to everyone who took part in Giving Day" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbGUsLDH-xI" style="color: #003c6c; text-decoration: underline;" title="Thank you to everyone who took part in Giving Day">Thank you to everyone who took part in Giving Day</a> last week. Through the hard work of many, Giving Day was an incredible success, with more than $1.5 million raised for student projects and programs through gifts from more than 5,000 donors! Both are remarkable totals &#8212; and new Giving Day donation and donor records! In a relatively short time, Giving Day has become essential to our efforts to enhance the student experience at UC Santa Cruz. I am delighted that the initiative is a collective effort, spearheaded by University Relations working in close partnerships with dozens and dozens of groups from across campus. Fundraising is crucial for UC Santa Cruz as we seek to continue along our remarkable trajectory, and Giving Day is unique in that it also deepens our engagement and connections with our broader community of alumni, parents, students and employees, building camaraderie as we all work together to advance UC Santa Cruz. Well done, Slugs!</p>
<h2 style="color: #003c6c; font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 22px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;">Campus co-hosts APEC forum on biodiversity&#160;</h2>
<p>Sustainability and climate change are the issues of our time, and I was thrilled that our campus was asked to partner with UC Davis and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities to <a alias="host this year&#8217;s biodiversity-focused University Leaders&#8217; Forum" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/11/apec-forum.html" style="color: #003c6c; text-decoration: underline;" title="host this year&#8217;s biodiversity-focused University Leaders&#8217; Forum">host this year&#8217;s biodiversity-focused University Leaders&#8217; Forum</a>, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum being held this week in San Francisco. Among Monday&#8217;s panel-discussion speakers were UC Santa Cruz Professors Natalia Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela, Michael Beck and Eric Palkovacs. Topics included the impact of climate change in coastal communities, water conservation in agriculture, and food security. More than 130 university presidents, professors, and researchers took part. It was a great opportunity to highlight the excellent work we are doing in this area, developing innovative solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change and sustain biodiversity. I am deeply proud of our efforts, and confident that our leadership will continue to make a positive difference.</p>
<h2 style="color: #003c6c; font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 22px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;">Online major boosts our effort to expand educational equity</h2>
<p>The Art Division&#8217;s new <a alias="Creative Technologies online major" conversion="false" data-linkto="https://" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/10/creative-technologies.html" style="color: #003c6c; text-decoration: underline;" title="Creative Technologies online major">Creative Technologies online major</a>, which we just announced last month and will officially launch next fall, is a great step for the university and one more way that we are working creatively to expand higher education opportunities, access and equity. We have such remarkable faculty and staff on our campus. In some instances, though &#8212; students may be location-bound to support dependents or to continue full-time work &#8212; moving to Santa Cruz is challenging if not impossible. This major will give these students the opportunity to earn a UC degree. It&#8217;s exciting to see the major being developed in real time: Students are being recruited, faculty members hired and courses scheduled. I&#8217;m grateful for all the work that has gone into creating this online major &#8212; the first of its kind in the entire UC system. We are truly leading at the intersection of innovation and social justice.</p>

<p>The United Way of Santa Cruz County has long been an advocate for area residents, promoting programs, projects and initiatives that aim to improve the everyday lives of people and brighten their futures. This year&#8217;s UC Santa Cruz employee campaign in support of United Way of Santa Cruz County launched earlier this week. I&#8217;m honored to serve on the nonprofit&#8217;s board of directors, as I&#8217;m a firm believer that wonderful things can happen when people come together, united in a common goal, and that&#8217;s what the United Way does best. It enables us to create positive change &#8212; change bigger than any of us could create alone.

<p>Estimada Comunidad del Campus:</p>
<p>Este oto&#241;o ha sido uno d&#237;ficil, ya que el impacto del creciente conflicto Israel-Ham&#225;s se ha expandido hacia nuestra comunidad y tantas otras. El Presidente de la Universidad de California, Michael Drake, en la reuni&#243;n de los Regentes de la UC, se dirigi&#243; al dolor y las tensiones que muchos estudiantes, miembros del personal y de la facultad de la UC est&#225;n experimentando a medida que enfrentamos colectivamente esta tragedia.</p>
<p>Como dijera el Presidente Drake, le debemos a todos en nuestra comunidad hacer cuanto est&#233; a nuestro alcance &#8220;para crear un clima de trabajo, vivencia y aprendizaje seguro y bien recibido, y para crear espacios educativos en los que todos podamos hallar informaci&#243;n factual, orientaci&#243;n e instrumentos pr&#225;cticos para un mejor entendimiento y para poder responder a lo que est&#225; sucediendo en torno a nosotros&#8221;. Con eso como meta &#233;l anunci&#243; la creaci&#243;n, a nivel de todo el sistema, de la Oficina de Derechos Civiles que aportar&#225; orientaci&#243;n y apoyo a todos los 10 campus respecto a los asuntos relacionados con la proteci&#243;n de los derechos civiles. &#201;l tambi&#233;n asign&#243; $7 millones en fondos de emergencia para todo el sistema a fin de proporcionar recursos adicionales de salud mental para los estudiantes, facultad, y personal; el desarrollo de un nuevo programa encaminado a informar y mejorar nuestras comunicaciones p&#250;blicas; y entrenar a la dirigencia, personal, y facultad de la UC a fin de asegurar que ellos puedan encarar proactivamente las cuestiones en curso y las emergentes en la educaci&#243;n superior. Las observaciones del Presidente Drake podr&#225;n hallarse en su totalidad <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-michael-v-drake-md-opening-remarks-november-15-regents-meeting">aqu&#237;</a>.</p>
<p>No hay una v&#237;a f&#225;cil para aliviar los conflictos que han surgido en la UC y los campus por todo el pa&#237;s a ra&#237;z del ataque terrorista de Ham&#225;s el pasado 7 de octubre y la actual respuesta militar israel&#237;. Har&#225; falta un trabajo duro y deliberado por parte de todos nosotros. Creo que el plan del Presidente Drake nos facilitar&#225; dar nuestros importantes primeros pasos.</p>
<p>Otro paso importante hacia la sanaci&#243;n ser&#225; tomarnos un tiempo para expresarles nuestra gratitud a quienes nos han apoyado y respaldado durante a&#241;os. Esto es tanto m&#225;s importante en momentos tan desafiantes como estos. S&#233; que me sentir&#233; especialmente agradecida este a&#241;o cuando tenga conmigo a mis seres queridos. Espero que el pr&#243;ximo receso de oto&#241;o (Nov. 22&#8211;26) les proporcione a Uds. un bien merecido tiempo libre para usarlo en la forma que mejor les venga a Uds. y a sus comunidades. Seguridad en sus viajes para quienes vayan a pasar el receso fuera del campus. En cuanto a los que permanecer&#225;n en el campus, consideren asistir a la Cena de la Cosecha (<em>Harvest Meal</em>), el jueves 23 de noviembre de 1 a 4 p.m., en el Comedor John R. Lewis del Colegio Nueve. La cena la brindar&#225; y organizar&#225; UCSC Dining, con el apoyo de la Oficina del Decano de Estudiantes y el Equipo de Necesidades B&#225;sicas. Todos los estudiantes, as&#237; como miembros de la facultad y del personal, y sus invitados ser&#225;n bienvenidos. Se requiere el <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesd7j6Z1qWrPXDf7LMTC0-q3MSzbFuFqfnIr0yP4GF8ytHtw/viewform">RSVP</a> dentro de un plazo de las 5 p.m. del martes 21 de noviembre, de manera que nuestro equipo de comedor sepa cu&#225;nta comida deber&#225; preparar. Anticipamos el poder celebrar con ustedes.</p>

<h2 style="color: #003c6c; font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 22px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;">El D&#237;a de D&#225;divas fue un &#233;xito rotundo</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbGUsLDH-xI">Gracias a todos Uds. que participaron en el D&#237;a de D&#225;divas</a> la semana pasada. Mediante el duro trabajo de muchos, el D&#237;a de D&#225;divas fue de un &#233;xito incre&#237;ble, &#161;con m&#225;s de $1.5 millones recaudados para proyectos y programas estudiantiles mediante las donaciones de m&#225;s de 5,000 donantes! Ambos totales son notables &#8211; &#161;y nuevos r&#233;cords en donaciones y donantes en el D&#237;a de D&#225;divas! En un plazo relativamente corto, el D&#237;a de D&#225;divas se ha convertido en algo esencial para nuestros esfuerzos por mejorar la experiencia estudiantil en la UC Santa Cruz. Me deleita ver que la iniciativa sea una labor colectiva, encabezada por Relaciones de la Universidad en estrecha colaboraci&#243;n con sociedades y docenas de grupos de todo el campus. La recaudaci&#243;n de fondos es crucial para la UC Santa Cruz a medida que buscamos continuar nuestra notable trayectoria, y el D&#237;a de D&#225;divas es algo &#250;nico ya que tambi&#233;n ampl&#237;a nuestro compromiso y conexiones con nuestra mayor comunidad de antiguos alumnos, padres, estudiantes y empleados, creando un esp&#237;ritu de camarader&#237;a a medida que juntos colaboramos en el avance de la UC Santa Cruz. &#161;Bien hecho, Slugs!</p>
<h2 style="color: #003c6c; font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 22px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;">El campus co-presenta foro de APEC sobre la biodiversidad</h2>
<p>La sostenibilidad y el cambio clim&#225;tico son los temas de nuestro tiempo, y qued&#233; emocionada al ver que a nuestro campus se le invitara a participar con la UC Davis y la Asociaci&#243;n de Universidades del <em>Pacific Rim</em> a fin de <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/11/apec-forum.html">presentar el Foro de Dirigentes Universitarios sobre la biodiversidad este a&#241;o</a>, el cual tuvo lugar junto al foro de Cooperaci&#243;n Econ&#243;mica Asia-Pac&#237;fico efectuado esta semana en San Francisco. Entre los oradores del panel en el debate del lunes estuvieron los profesores de la UC Santa Cruz Natalia Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela, Michael Beck y Eric Palkovacs. El temario incluy&#243; el impacto del cambio clim&#225;tico en las comunidades costeras, la conservaci&#243;n del agua en la agricultura, y la seguridad alimentaria. M&#225;s de 130 presidentes, profesores e investigadores universitarios tomaron parte. Fue una gran oportunidad para destacar el excelente trabajo que estamos haciendo en esta &#225;rea, elaborando soluciones innovadoras a fin de mitigar los efectos del cambio clim&#225;tico y sostener la biodiversidad. Nuestra labor me enorgullece profundamente, y conf&#237;o en que nuestro liderazgo contin&#250;e marcando la diferencia.</p>
<h2 style="color: #003c6c; font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 22px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;">La especializaci&#243;n online impulsa nuestra labor por ampliar la equidad educativa</h2>
<p>La nueva especialidad de la Divisi&#243;n de Arte <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/10/creative-technologies.html">Tecnolog&#237;as Creativas como especializaci&#243;n online</a>, la cual se dio a conocer el mes pasado y entrar&#225; en vigor oficialmente el pr&#243;ximo curso de oto&#241;o, es un gran paso adelante para la universidad y una forma m&#225;s en la que podemos trabajar de manera creativa para ampliar las oportunidades de estudios superiores, as&#237; como el acceso y la equidad. Nuestra facultad y nuestro personal son tan notables. No obstante, en algunos casos &#8211; los estudiantes pudieran verse restringidos a sus centros, a fin de mantener a sus dependientes o de continuar en sus empleos a tiempo completo &#8211; mudarse a Santa Cruz pudiera resultar dif&#237;cil o incluso imposible. Esta especializaci&#243;n dar&#225; a estos estudiantes la oportunidad de alcanzar un diploma de la UC. Es emocionante ver que la especializaci&#243;n se elabora en tiempo real: Ya se est&#225;n reclutando estudiantes, contratando miembros de la facultad y programando los cursos. Estoy muy agradecida por todo el trabajo que se ha dedicado a la creaci&#243;n de esta especializaci&#243;n <em>online</em> &#8211; la primera en su g&#233;nero en todo el sistema de la UC. Estamos verdaderamente a la cabeza en la intersecci&#243;n de la innovaci&#243;n y la justicia social.</p>
<h2 style="color: #003c6c; font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 22px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;">Ha comenzado la Campa&#241;a Anual de United Way</h2>
<p>La United Way del Condado de Santa Cruz ha sido desde hace mucho una defensora de los residentes del &#225;rea, promoviendo programas, proyectos e iniciativas dirigidos a mejorar la vida cotidiana de la gente e iluminar su futuro. La campa&#241;a de los empleados de la UC Santa Cruz este a&#241;o, en apoyo de la United Way del Condado de Santa Cruz, comenz&#243; a principios de esta semana. Me honra servir en la junta de directores de esa entidad sin fines de lucro, ya que soy una firme creyente en que se pueden lograr corsas maravillosas cuando la gente se agrupa, unida por una meta com&#250;n, y eso es lo que mejor hace la United Way. Hace posible la creaci&#243;n de cambios positivos &#8211; cambios mayores de los que ninguno de nosotros podr&#237;a crear por cuenta propia. &#161;Visite el <a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/ucscunited">sitio web de la campa&#241;a</a> para m&#225;s detalles!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center will lead a new UC Essential Needs Research, Training, and Promising Practices Consortium, becoming the hub for training and technical assistance programs for basic needs providers at all 10 UC campuses to enhance students&#8217; access to food, housing, and other essential resources. The center will also expand and strengthen the research community around essential needs across the University of California, including through research grants to faculty and professional researchers. The center will also support systemwide evaluations of essential needs programs to identify promising practices for broader adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an honor for UC Santa Cruz to be selected to house this innovative systemwide initiative,&#8221; said the center&#8217;s director, Psychology Professor Heather Bullock. &#8220;In many ways, this is a major expansion and recognition of basic needs research that our center has been doing for many years related to student housing and food insecurity. Now we&#8217;ll be able to support and advance this type of work across the whole UC system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new leadership role in UC basic needs work comes at an exciting time for the center, which is in the midst of relaunching as the UCSC Center for Economic Justice and Action. In addition to its new systemwide work, the center will continue the community-engaged anti-poverty research and programming that it is well known for. A new website will launch this winter to share more information about the transition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the UC Office of the President will continue to provide systemwide policy guidance, data collection, and administrative leadership related to basic needs, including allocating more than $15 million annually across campuses to implement direct service programs to UC students. UCOP previously housed all basic needs training and technical support programs, but moving these programs to the UCSC Center for Economic Justice and Action will allow them to grow and be paired strategically with the new systemwide research and evaluation funding opportunities that the center will launch.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynthia D&#225;valos, interim associate vice provost for student and equity affairs at the University of California Office of the President, said these changes are an investment in student </span><a href="https://basicneeds.ucop.edu/about/goals.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">basic needs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s part of one of the largest anti-poverty and economic justice efforts in UC&#8217;s history: a push to cut the number of UC students experiencing basic needs insecurity in half by 2025.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Meeting the basic needs of our students and ensuring that they have the resources they need to achieve their full potential is a university priority of the highest order,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is extraordinary work in basic needs taking place all across the University of California, and the UC Santa Cruz Center for Economic Justice and Action will coordinate and advance those efforts in exciting new ways that will multiply our impact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive said the new partnership will also bolster the campus&#8217;s </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/foodways-fund.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-pronged approach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to basic needs for UCSC students, which includes field-to-plate food security, access to food pantry resources and dining halls, holistic CalFresh support, student-centered basic needs research and assessment, and the Slug Support program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are working hard to provide a comprehensive safety net for students and close equity gaps in student success,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;Hosting a center on campus that&#8217;s leading at the UC system level will amplify those efforts, and we look forward to the innovations and improvements that the center will produce.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Food Systems Education and Research Specialist Tim Galarneu and UC Berkeley Director of Strategic Equity Initiatives Ruben Canedo will co-lead systemwide essential needs training and technical support programs with the UCSC Center for Economic Justice and Action. Galarneu and Canedo previously served as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-chairs for the UC Systemwide Basic Needs Committee with UCOP</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bringing their work into the center will enable them to provide more specialized training to the individual campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullock and UC San Francisco Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics Suzanna Martinez will co-lead the research and evaluation aspects of the center&#8217;s UC essential needs work. Bullock says the center aims to build a robust learning and research community that will bring together faculty, researchers, and practitioners interested in essential needs issues. The center will release its first call for grant proposals later this fall and will do so on an annual basis moving forward, with a systemwide advisory board reviewing research proposals and making funding decisions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center will also host workshops and events to share research findings and will participate in communities of practice and professional networks related to essential needs in higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is for the Center for Economic Justice and Action to be the place where people go, across the UC system and beyond, to learn about innovations in ensuring that all student essential needs are met,&#8221; Bullock said. &#8220;By building new bridges between practitioners, researchers, and other stakeholders, we can amplify promising practices that will drive this crucial work forward.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="de11091a80727046523d899e574f1b39"><name>calderon-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>François Monard honored with Calderón Prize for inverse problems work</title><summary>University of California, Santa Cruz professor of mathematics François Monard has received the prestigious Calderón Prize for his work in the field of inverse problems. </summary><start-date>1700208000000</start-date><path>/2023/11/calderon-prize</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/calderon-prize</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1700237740295</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1700237740295</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Mathematics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Erin Malsbury</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/calderon-prize.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/calderon-prize.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>calderon-prize.jpeg</name><display-name>calderon-prize.jpeg</display-name><file-size>51436</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/11/images/calderon-prize-thumb.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/11/images/calderon-prize-thumb.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>calderon-prize-thumb.jpeg</name><display-name>calderon-prize-thumb.jpeg</display-name><file-size>3257</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left to right: Thorsten Hohage (Professor at Georg-August-Universit&#228;t G&#246;ttingen and chair of the Calder&#243;n jury), Fran&#231;ois Monard, Barbara Kaltenbacher (Professor at Universit&#228;t Klagenfurt and President of IPIA).

Broadly defined, researchers working with inverse problems use known parameters to calculate unknown information. It&#8217;s the math behind imaging sciences &#8212; such as MRIs used to see inside patients and seismic imaging used to understand the subsurface of the Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every two years, the </span><a href="https://ipia.site/Home/index.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inverse Problems International Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IPIA) awards the Calder&#243;n Prize to a researcher under the age of 40 who has made significant contributions to the field. The prize is awarded at the Applied Inverse Problems Conference. Because the 2021 conference was canceled due to COVID precautions, the 2021 and 2023 prizes were both awarded this year. Monard was awarded the 2021 prize, and Angkana R&#252;land at the University of Bonn in Germany won the 2023 prize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monard joined UC Santa Cruz as an assistant professor in 2016. The Calder&#243;n Prize recognizes his work on numerical and theoretical aspects of the inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform, multi-wave inverse problems and inverse problems for the radiative transfer equation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The last two are topics which I&#8217;ve been involved in for over a decade, and X-ray transforms have captured my attention more recently, to which I&#8217;m currently dedicating 90% of my research efforts. &#8221; Monard said. His work on generalized X-ray involves generalizing models for CT scans to cases where X-rays travel along curved paths rather than straight lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When doctors reconstruct a slice of a patient&#8217;s body from a CAT scan, they&#8217;re under the assumption that the X-rays passing through the patient's body are traveling along straight lines,&#8221; Monard explains. &#8220;For that purpose, it&#8217;s an accurate model, but there are other contexts where propagation might not happen along straight lines. This added complexity in the mathematical model generates many intricacies to the reconstruction problem, and I am interested in addressing those intricacies for more precision.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The field of inverse problems ranges from applied engineering to theoretical mathematics. That span makes this award feel extra special to Monard.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an honor because it's coming from a community that scrutinizes the applications from all directions across the pure and applied spectrum,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monard&#8217;s work lies in the middle of that spectrum. He likes constructive approaches to problem-solving and proof-of-concept implementations with practical applications in sight.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In my quest for making more precise and practical statements about X-ray transforms, I also like to take deeper dives into new mathematical toolboxes, drawing from the areas of partial differential equations, microlocal analysis, geometry and mathematical statistics,&#8221; Monard adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monard appreciates the inverse problems research community and feels honored by the recognition from the IPIA.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I heard I was being awarded this, I was thinking as far as my community goes, this is the best prize I could hope to get,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="df3f77da80727046523d899e34eb7fed"><name>harvest-meal-2023</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Annual Harvest Meal planned for November 23</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Dining will be hosting the annual Harvest Meal on Thursday, November 23, 1–4 p.m., at the College Nine/John R.

<p>Researchers based at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) and University College London (UCL) investigated the relationship between termite availability and chimpanzee fishing. They found that termites are most available early in the wet season. Although other foods are abundant at that time, chimpanzees choose to termite fish then. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe these results set up an interesting hypothesis about wild chimpanzee foraging cognition,&#8221; said Dr Vicky Oelze, UCSC, senior author of the study in<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2023.1289433/full"><em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em></a>. &#8220;Though we can never read a chimpanzee&#8217;s thoughts, we can perhaps start to get an idea of their expectations of resource availability by analyzing the instances in which they arrive at termite mounds and investigate them for fishing viability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Termites are a key source of nutrients for chimpanzees &#8212; but the species chimpanzees prefer live deep within fortress-like mounds. However, some termites will disperse to start a new colony elsewhere, leaving the mound via flight holes the chimpanzees exploit for termite fishing. In some places, chimpanzees fish all year: in others, fishing is seasonal.</p>
<p>Understanding termite availability is important to understanding the variation in chimpanzee use of fishing tools. Does tool use vary between chimpanzee populations because the opportunities are different, because needs are different, or because tool use is unlikely to be invented or maintained? To understand the predators, we need to understand the prey.</p>
<p>The scientists focused on Issa Valley, Tanzania, which has very distinct wet and dry seasons. The researchers collected years of meteorological data and camera trap footage of 13 mounds to map the dispersals and predation of termites across time. They also carried out termite-fishing trials at 14 mounds between 2018 and 2022, copying chimpanzee tools and techniques.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first visited the Issa Valley, I quickly learned that it was more difficult to termite fish than I had expected,&#8221; said Seth Phillips, UCSC, corresponding author. &#8220;It alerted me to the idea that effective foraging for these termite prey might be more complicated than people commonly understand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of 1,924 attempts at termite fishing, 363 extracted termites. The scientists found that they were much more likely to be able to extract termites as rainfall increased &#8212; until 200mm of rain had fallen. Then the proportion of successful trials dropped. Most termite mounds were most active between 50-200mm of cumulative rainfall. Dispersal flights only took place in the wet season and stopped almost completely after 400mm of rainfall.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently reviewing camera trap footage of the chimpanzee behaviors at these mounds,&#8221; said Phillips. &#8220;We want to know how chimps adapt their searching behavior according to seasonal changes. For instance, do they investigate termite mounds directly after rainfall after a long dry spell? This data could say something interesting about their foraging cognition as related to tool-use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chimpanzees were among the most frequently recorded predators at termite mounds during dispersal flights and often arrived carrying a tool. At this time of year in Issa Valley, other food is available: the chimpanzees use tools to termite fish because they can, not because they need to.</p>
<p>Although some chimpanzee communities exploit termites all year, including at relatively nearby Gombe Stream, termite fishing there also peaks in the early wet season. Some year-round fishers may be benefiting from softer soil or more effective toolsets. It&#8217;s unclear whether more sophisticated tools would allow continuous exploitation of termite mounds at Issa Valley, but initial tests suggest otherwise. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, we are human experimenters attempting to replicate a chimpanzee behavior,&#8221; cautioned Phillips. &#8220;It should not be taken for granted, for instance, that we are just as effective at foraging for termites with these tools as chimpanzees. I would expect the window of opportunity for chimpanzees to termite fish in the Issa Valley is at least a little bit wider than it is for human researchers.&#8221;<em>&#160;</em></p>

<p>I write today to draw attention, and provide references, to University of California policy regarding academic freedom and political advocacy in the classroom and other instructional spaces. In an overall context that provides instructors with considerable academic freedom, University policy imposes limits on using the classroom and courses of instruction for&#160; political advocacy. These University policy limits co-exist with the free speech rights all individuals have when acting as private citizens.&#160;</p>
<p>The principal policies that apply to these matters are (references to the URLs are below this message):</p>
<ul>
<li>For all instructors and Teaching Assistants, <a href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2301.html">Regents&#8217; Policy 2301</a>;</li>
<li>For Senate faculty, the Faculty Code of Conduct found in Section 015 of the Academic Personnel Manual (<a href="https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/apm/apm-015.pdf">APM 015</a>); and</li>
<li>For Unit 18 Lecturers, Section B4 of the <a href="https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/bargaining-units/ix/docs/ix_03_academic-responsibility_2016-2020.pdf">Collective Bargaining agreement</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Centrally, I want to call your attention to <a href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2301.html">Regents&#8217; Policy 2301</a>, which applies to all members of the University instructional community, in its prohibition of canceling a class session for the purpose of encouraging students to participate in a protest or rally.</p>
<p>I want to highlight several prohibitions in these policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>significant intrusion of material unrelated to the course (APM 015, Section II, A.1.b and Section B4(b) of Unit 18 agreement);</li>
<li>use of the position or powers of a faculty member to coerce the judgment or conscience of a student or to cause harm to a student for arbitrary or personal reasons (APM 015, Section II, A.5 and Section B4(h) of Unit 18 agreement); and</li>
<li>misuse of the classroom by allowing it to be used for political indoctrination, for purposes other than those for which the course was constituted, or for providing grades without commensurate and appropriate student achievement (<a href="https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/governance/policies/2301.html">Regents&#8217; Policy 2301</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition,</p>
<ul>
<li>Regents&#8217; Policy 2301 stipulates &#8220;the right of students to have their classes held on the regularly scheduled basis and to be taught by the instructor whose responsibility it is to teach the course in question is to be upheld&#8221;; and</li>
<li>APM 015, Part II, A.1.c. defines &#8220;significant failure to adhere, without legitimate reason, to the rules of the faculty in the conduct of courses, to meet class, to keep office hours, or to hold examinations as scheduled&#8221; to be a violation of the Faculty Code of Conduct.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to remind all in our campus community of our <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/principles-community/#:&#126;:text=The%20University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa,practice%20these%20Principles%20of%20Community">Principles of Community</a> and of the importance of ensuring that students are not made to feel intimidated, threatened, and/or excluded in their classes.&#160;</p>
<p>It is our collective responsibility to foster a safe and welcoming learning, living, and working environment while also promoting the principles of free expression and academic freedom.&#160;</p>
<p>Instructors who have questions concerning permissible or impermissible actions should discuss them with their department chair or dean.</p>

In her current role as a health justice coordinator for RYSE Youth Center in Richmond, California, and a graduate student at UC Berkeley, Gizachew is passionate about mentoring, education, and cultivating safe spaces.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daughter of Ethiopian immigrants, Gizachew is a first-generation college graduate whose goal is to support underserved communities, especially BIPOC and first-gen youth.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Coming from an Ethiopian immigrant family and being first-generation myself, there's a lot of disconnects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in understanding the higher education system and social experiences that our families haven&#8217;t navigated before,&#8221; Gizachew says. &#8220;It felt like it was on me to figure out everything, so that&#8217;s why I wanted to get into all these people-helping roles and support others who might go through the same experiences as myself.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gizachew graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a B.A. in community studies and psychology. As a part of her major requirement, she did field study hours at RYSE Youth Center. Once she graduated, she was offered a full-time job at RYSE as a health justice coordinator. In her position, Gizachew works on health education programming for young people. This includes a Tasty Tuesday program, where Gizachew cooks meals with youth while they learn about food justice;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> LGBTQ+ comprehensive sex education</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and internship programs she runs on physical health promotion in BIPOC communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her work at RYSE Youth Center, Gizachew is working toward her M.A. in social welfare from UC Berkeley.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was debating between getting a master&#8217;s in public health and a master&#8217;s in social work, but social work is a lot more broad and diverse within the work that you can do. So it made more sense for me to follow this route, because I can still do the health education work. But another interest of mine is mental health and therapy. So that&#8217;s also why I wanted to go the social work route.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gizachew says that the experiences she had at UCSC greatly contributed to her career goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her time as an undergraduate at UCSC, Gizachew was part of a handful of organizations that contributed to her education. She was a Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Internship Program intern with the Student Health Outreach and Promotion center, a Facilitators for Racial and Ethnic Diversity intern, and a program coordinator with the African American Resource Center. In addition, Gizachew worked as a lending library intern and first-generation mentor for the Equal Opportunity Program, a Black Academy mentor, a Destination Higher Education mentor, and an RA for College Ten.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She still managed to graduate a year early.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was a juggler for sure,&#8221; Gizachew says. &#8220;In all of those roles I was supporting people, I was connecting folks to resources, and I really enjoyed the mentorship role. Guiding other folks relates to the work I'm doing now.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC really helped me on my career path,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I learned so many things within each of the roles [I had at UCSC], and I think that has really prepared me for a career in&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">working with diverse communities and seeing myself as a social worker and a health educator. I am grateful to UC Santa Cruz for that. I feel like there were a lot of opportunities for me there and I took advantage of them.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ee7eadfc8072704602b2aed42fbfb8d6"><name>noah-whitley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Life Beyond the Redwoods: Noah Whitley reflects on the value of a UCSC degree one year later </title><summary>One year after graduating from UCSC, Noah Whitley works as a legislative assistant for a political consulting firm that works closely with the California State Legislature. &#13;

When he moved out of his hometown for the first time to attend UC Santa Cruz, Whitley didn&#8217;t expect to become part of the state&#8217;s legislative process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today he works as a legislative assistant for a political consulting firm that works closely with the California State Legislature in Sacramento, following his graduation from UC Santa Cruz in 2022 with a B.A. in environmental studies and a minor in history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seeing policy firsthand has helped me to understand how the California government is working through important issues that are currently of utmost importance within the state,&#8221; Whitley says. &#8220;As I continue with my career, I hope to continually be involved in seeing the progress of policy and how that context paves the future of individuals across California, as well as the rest of the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitley performs a variety of tasks at his job, including analyzing bill amendments, keeping track of deadlines and the placement of bills, and informing team members when bills are being heard in political committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His favorite part about the job is being present at policy hearings and being able to see the political process firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I graduated from UCSC with a history minor and feel that, in a way, I am a part of history by participating in this process,&#8221; he explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whitley previously interned at the UCSC Arboretum for two quarters and the Stevenson Garden, where he says he developed his understanding of natural resources. He also served as a facilitator in the Facilitators for Racial and Ethnic Diversity (F.R.E.D.) organization attached to the African American Resource Center (AARC) for two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience Whitley acquired as a F.R.E.D. intern became an essential skill set in his current role. Whitley also credits many of his classes for his current understanding of the dense materials he often comes across in the state capitol.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In many of my classes at UCSC, we focused on interpreting large pieces of information</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and being able to derive information from them, as well as being able to make inferences based on that text,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This teaching carries on to my daily work life. In addition, some of the classes revolving around environmental law and political entities provided me with a foundation for those governmental organizations I hear about everyday now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little over a year after his graduation, Whitley is on a path to pursue his career goals and aspirations.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, about a year after graduating from UC Santa Cruz, his dreams have come to fruition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward is pursuing a Ph.D. in anthropology with a focus on archaeology from McGill University in Quebec&#160;</span>and&#160;is an editor at<i> Collective Research in Anthropology&#160;</i><i>Journal</i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His primary focus lies in the Andes. He is particularly interested in how groups conquered by the Inka used their experiences with that group to inform their responses to Spanish colonization.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While not a particularly novel interest, without the contemporary documentary evidence that archaeologists working in classically lauded areas like Greece or Egypt have, there is much to be done and many gaps in existing research,&#8221; explains Ward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward began his Ph.D. in 2023 and is ecstatic at the opportunity to teach others about the field he is passionate about. He is grateful to have already gotten a glimpse of that experience in the summer of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after graduating from UCSC, Ward traveled to Ecuador to work as a crew chief for the Arqueologico Projecto Zuleta and Zuleta Field School. There, he documented and analyzed artifacts and trained Ecuadorian undergraduate students in lithic and ceramic analysis. Ward oversaw five students excavating a 3x2m unit and ensured the well-being of all students affiliated with the project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward also worked as a lab assistant at the Cochasqu&#237; archaeological project, where he analyzed and documented over 1,000 artifacts collected from the project. When he returned from Ecuador, Ward worked as a course assistant at UC Santa Cruz, leading four sections of up to 15 students each.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love teaching, and archaeology is a particularly special science because it is almost only pursued by those with a genuine love for the discipline,&#8221; Ward says. &#8220;That made my jobs easy but all the more fruitful. I liked to think the students I was teaching in each of these positions loved hearing about archaeology, and I definitely loved talking to them about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward&#8217;s main aspiration is to make the archaeology field more accessible to people around the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through methodologies such as community-based archaeology, participatory research, and citizen science, I believe that the discipline can be opened up in a way that it never was before&#8212;to the diverse and undeniably important perspectives of those so long excluded from the discipline.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Setting the groundwork at UCSC</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UC Santa Cruz, Ward pursued two opportunities that changed the course of his career. He worked as an officer in the Integrated Anthropology Association (IAA) and spent a quarter in Washington, D.C., as part of the UCDC program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the IAA, Ward says he sharpened his lecturing skills by developing short, discussion-based lectures geared toward exposing the varied aspects of anthropology to club members, and he developed close relationships with his peers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The members of the club were among some of the most driven and intelligent people I have ever met, and I think they will continue to be a part of my network well into the future,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in Washington, D.C., Ward interned at one of the most famous museums in the world:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I interned at the Smithsonian. THE SMITHSONIAN. If I had told the child me I had this experience waiting for me, I would&#8217;ve passed out on the spot. In all seriousness, it was an extremely important experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I mark that experience as the beginning of my career,&#8221; Ward says. &#8220;Having a big name like the Smithsonian on my r&#233;sum&#233;, in addition to the connections I made, defined my senior year, and in a workaround way, was the reason I attended an archaeological conference later that same year, where I met my current Ph.D. advisor.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ward says he is grateful to his parents, who have supported his dreams since childhood, and to UCSC for bringing those dreams to reality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to be an archaeologist since I was six,&#8221; says Ward, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t understand what being an archaeologist meant until my first year at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ee9104598072704602b2aed41bbcd6c5"><name>teresa-faasolo</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Life Beyond the Redwoods: Teresa Faasolo reflects on her educational journey one year after graduating from UCSC </title><summary>A year after graduating with a B.S. in computer engineering from UCSC, Teresal Faasolo (Merrill ’22) is a software quality assurance engineer at Digital Dynamics, Inc., based in Scotts Valley. </summary><start-date>1700514600000</start-date><display-name>teresa-faasolo</display-name><path>/2023/11/teresa-faasolo</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/teresa-faasolo</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1700514563144</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1700591265289</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Rachel Raiyani</name><title></title><phone/><email>rraiyani@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/faasolopic3-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/faasolopic3-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faasolopic3-1.jpg</name><display-name>faasolopic3-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>108525</file-size><width>450</width><height>611</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/faasolopic3thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/faasolopic3thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faasolopic3thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>faasolopic3thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>20897</file-size><width>59</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Teresa Faasolo (Merrill &#8217;22, computer engineering)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teresa Faasolo&#8217;s first day at UC Santa Cruz still rings clear in her mind thanks to a long trudge up Crown/Merrill College&#8217;s &#8220;cardiac hill&#8221;&#8212;arguably the steepest hill on campus. The climb, paired with the euphoric feeling of being at UC Santa Cruz for the first time, left Faasolo breathless.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mind cleared with one thought:&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made it.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faasolo grew up in East Palo Alto in a Tongan-Samoan household. Her parents immigrated to the United States in their teens. Her father was a sheet metal worker, while her mother worked as a caretaker for the elderly.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;[Being first-gen] was difficult. My family only knew as far as construction, and that was the closest they had to STEM-related knowledge,&#8221; Fassolo says. &#8220;The only way they could help me is by giving me as much financial support as they could provide, but most importantly, the emotional support I needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, about a year after graduating with a B.S. in computer engineering, Faasolo is a software quality assurance engineer at Digital Dynamics, Inc., based in Scotts Valley.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Faasolo&#8217;s Trek to Tech</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first year of school was no cakewalk. On top of being a first-generation college student and a person of color, Faasolo embarked on a field with a very small population of women.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew she wanted to do something challenging and fulfilling, and as her first year went on she settled on computer engineering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how to code before I got to college,&#8221; Faasolo says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first classes she took was CSE 12, Computer Systems and Assembly Language. After her first midterm exam, Faasolo felt worried about her ability to sustain herself in the class.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the verge of failing CSE 12, she reached out to her professor to ask for help. After many sleepless nights, she pulled through and the coding language began to click.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the class where she truly learned how to code.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a woman in STEM. I&#8217;m POC, too. I had little to no experience in computer programming. But this class was a game changer,&#8221; Faasolo says. &#8220;It&#8217;s where I realized how much I really wanted this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout her whole journey at UCSC, she faced the challenges of being in a male-dominated field, and her classes often reflected that reality. Faasolo refused to let it keep her down.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her own motivation keeping her steady, she also found great comfort in the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) Program. Faasolo found her community within MEP, which aims to foster the growth of first-generation engineering students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They had supportive tutors who had been through the experience,&#8221; Faasolo says. &#8220;People were there to listen and relate, and make us feel better about our experiences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went from struggling in CSE 12 to being a leader in her mechatronics class for her senior capstone project.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a career fair at Jack Baskin Engineering&#8217;s Courtyard, she found Digital Dynamics, Inc. She took the chance, applied&#8212;and landed an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Faasolo&#8217;s managers and her colleagues say she brings an uplifting energy to a rather competitive field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you can find your muse, or that little light in the dark tunnel, you can push through any hardships that you might face,&#8221; Faasolo explains. &#8220;Every time I needed to get my head straight, I thought of my reason: self-improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the years have gone by since that first trudge up cardiac hill, Faasolo keeps outperforming her own expectations and growing with each new step she takes for herself.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each time, she is left with the same feeling:</span></p>

He was mesmerized by the scientific equipment and began envisioning himself wearing the crisp white lab coat, an essential part of a science researcher&#8217;s uniform.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosqueira grew up in Los Angeles County and was raised by his mother and grandparents. As he began to take academics more seriously in high school, he discovered an interest in science. &#8220;It started with physics and then when I took AP Biology, it was mind-blowing to learn about the living world at such a small scale. It was the most in-depth I had ever gone in biology, so I knew I wanted to learn more&#8221; he says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosqueira credits much of his academic success and access to opportunities to his involvement in UCSC organizations like Science Education and Mentorship in Latinx Lives in Academia (SEMILLA) that support STEM-passionate students who may also be BIPOC, first-generation, or from historically marginalized communities. He was also a part of his department&#8217;s DEI committee, where he contributed to the implementation of a program to pay undergraduate students for their research. Undergraduate research is typically unpaid, preventing students who can&#8217;t afford to work for free from conducting research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosqueira worked for MCD Biology Professor Susan Carpenter&#8217;s lab, which he was a part of for three years, until the end of his senior year. During the same time that Mosqueira joined Carpenter&#8217;s lab, he learned about a program called STEM Diversity. He felt seen at the recruitment event, where STEM Diversity staff discussed what it is like to be a minority in STEM and how they provide students with tools to be successful.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosqueira eagerly applied for UC Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (LEADS) through the STEM Diversity program, setting him up with two paid summer research internships and mentorship that helped him pursue a career in STEM research. He continued working for Carpenter&#8217;s lab remotely during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, learning computational analysis during his first UC LEADS summer internship program. Mosqueira spent his second summer research internship at UCLA. Along with providing research opportunities for students, the UC LEADS program includes professional development and graduate school application workshops, as well as academic resources like tutoring and study hours. &#8220;One of the biggest things aside from all that was having a sense of community and feeling like there&#8217;s a team supporting you,&#8221; Mosqueira says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, a year after his graduation, Mosqueira is a research assistant for MCD Biology Assistant Professor </span><a href="https://farmer.mcdb.ucla.edu/research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">D&#8217;Juan Farmer&#8217;s lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at UCLA, where he studies the development of the skull and how disrupting these growth patterns leads to craniofacial defects. Mosqueira has a more prominent role than he had as an undergrad and is in charge of creating new models in mice and zebrafish to study this phenomenon in detail.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says it&#8217;s fun to reflect on his time in the lab as an undergraduate student at UCSC. One of the most notable memories for him was seeing his name on a scientific paper he conducted research for in Carpenter&#8217;s lab published in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Immunology, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">describing the role of LincRNA-Cox2 in lung injury. The research opportunities Mosqueira had and his involvement in programs committed to supporting diversity in STEM provided him with the experience and motivation to pursue research after he graduated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Professor Farmer has been an influential mentor for Mosqueira. Farmer has not only supported Mosqueira as he applies for Ph.D. programs in MCD biology to start in the fall of 2024, but he also shares Mosqueira&#8217;s experience as a person of color in STEM and his goals to make STEM a more diverse field that is accessible for people from all backgrounds. Mosqueira greatly benefited from programs to bring diversity into STEM research as a student, and he wants to pay that forward.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosqueira is excited to pursue his Ph.D., not only to gain expertise but to assume a larger influence in creating more diversity in STEM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Research in STEM is a white male&#8211;dominated field,&#8221; Mosqueira says. &#8220;And the only way that we&#8217;re going to shift away from that trend is if people who are minorities come into STEM with high ambitions and really want to transform lab culture.

From climate change to water pollution to deforestation and more, environmental problems are widespread, yet the consequences of these issues are not borne equally. Instead, it is often those in marginalized and under-resourced communities who disproportionately bear the brunt of environmental impacts. Environmental justice offers tools to better navigate these structural inequities and increase the prospects for a healthier planet and a more livable future for all.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But teaching environmental justice principles in the classroom is complex. Instructors need to have a broad, interdisciplinary understanding of the interconnections between social and environmental issues. They also need to know how to respectfully and ethically incorporate knowledge produced by different types of knowledge holders, such as by Indigenous communities and other frontline communities that have deep experience with environmental impacts. And instructors need creative new teaching strategies to connect deeply with students and bolster their resilience and agency in the face of daunting global challenges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new book developed by UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff equips educators to more successfully navigate these challenges. </span><a href="https://teachingenvironmentaljustice.sites.ucsc.edu/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching Environmental Justice: Practices to Engage Students and Build Community</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">offers an accessible, flexible, and evidence-based collection of teaching examples, strategies, and classroom tools to help integrate environmental justice into courses in ways that center equity in course design and the student learning experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first section of the book provides instructors with concrete classroom activities for teaching about environmental politics and justice and offers recommendations to help instructors develop appropriate learning outcomes through such projects. The book&#8217;s second section then looks beyond the field of environmental politics and justice to reflect on what instructors can learn about teaching this subject from strategies used in other disciplines to center equity and justice in student learning and incorporate other ways of knowing the world.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book project itself also offers a model for how faculty can advance their teaching practice by learning from one another. It was developed through extensive collaboration among scholar-teachers from 16 institutions across the country who represented a broad range of fields including political science, the arts, economics, astrophysics, history, Native American studies, engineering, online education, ecology, pyrogeography, and many others. The contributors were an exceptionally diverse group that included many BIPOC scholars.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The learning community that we built in order to produce this book was absolutely crucial,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Environmental Studies Professor </span><a href="https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=sjinnah"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sikina Jinnah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-editor for the project. &#8220;We helped each other to break out of the norms of our respective disciplines and cross-pollinate our successes in ways that resulted in some really innovative new ideas and recommendations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the book's introductory chapter, Jinnah also contributed a project-based chapter related to her research on climate engineering. The book also has contributions from many other UCSC faculty and staff, including Physical and Biological Sciences Division faculty members </span><a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/about/dept-directory.php?uid=kkroeker"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristy Kroeker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/about/dept-directory.php?uid=rdunkin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robin Dunkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=raruiz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Social Sciences Division faculty members </span><a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=srrajan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ravi Rajan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=floralu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flora Lu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Assistant Vice Provost for Educational Innovation </span><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/bios/michael-tassio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Tassio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and Assistant Director of the Center for Creative Ecologies </span><a href="https://havc.ucsc.edu/people/students/chessa-adsit-morris"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chessa Adsit-Morris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department. Three leaders from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching and Learning Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (TLC) co-edited the book with Jinnah, including Associate Campus Provost for Student Success and TLC Founding Director </span><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/bios/jody-greene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jody Greene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Associate Director for Learning </span><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/bios/jessie-dubreuil/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessie Dubreiul</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Managing Director </span><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/bios/samara-foster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Foster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from UCSC&#8217;s Teaching and Learning Center lent expertise to the project on how to apply the science of learning to support faculty preparation, course and curriculum design, and student success. TLC Founding Director Jody Greene said the center played a supporting role for the collaborative work happening among faculty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This book is an outstanding example of what can happen when leading researchers in a shared scholarly field who are dedicated to teaching come together to share and refine their teaching practices,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The novelty of our approach was to ask these researchers to join in a community of practice and also to work with teaching and learning specialists and educational innovators in other fields as they developed their contributions to the book. We believe instructors both within and beyond the field of environmental justice will find the book very useful, and students will benefit from the approaches it recommends.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene believes the book &#8220;beats back the old adage that the best researchers are not the most dedicated educators,&#8221; and they hope other groups of scholar-educators may be inspired to try the approach of coming together to share and disseminate innovative teaching practices. The book&#8217;s editors and contributors also hope their efforts will inspire more instructors to incorporate teaching environmental justice into their classrooms in a way that offers students hope and equips them with the skills and understanding they need to create positive change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Environmental justice is key to addressing the biggest social and environmental challenges our world is facing today,&#8221; Jinnah said. &#8220;As educators, it&#8217;s our responsibility to rise to the challenge in how we prepare the next generation of leaders and equip them with the tools to not replicate the mistakes and injustices of prior generations.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f303ddf880727046571ba75fb44454ee"><name>falcon-sws</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz faculty member elected president of Sociologists for Women in Society</title><summary>Associate Professor of Latin American and Latino Studies (LALS) Sylvanna Falcón was recently elected president of Sociologists for Women in Society (SWS).

Falc&#243;n says SWS is the most important professional organization for feminist sociologists in the country. The organization was founded in 1969, with a focus on supporting the success, leadership, and influence of women in the field of sociology and improving the social position of women in society through feminist sociological research and writing. SWS&#8217;s connection to UC Santa Cruz dates back decades: Sociology Professor Emerita <a href="https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/cd_detail?uid=roby">Pamela Roby</a> was instrumental in the organization&#8217;s founding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falc&#243;n joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in the Department of Latin American and Latino Studies in 2010 and is also an affiliated faculty member in Sociology. She is the founder and director of UC Santa Cruz's <a href="https://humanrights.ucsc.edu/">Human Rights Investigations Lab</a> and former director of the <a href="https://huerta.ucsc.edu/">Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas</a>. Falc&#243;n&#8217;s research focuses on global activist engagements with human rights, especially amongst feminists, and how this deepens the political significance of human rights today. She is a long-time member of Sociologists for Women in Society and has helped encourage UC Santa Cruz graduate students to apply for funding through the organization.

The annual award is the division&#8217;s highest honor for faculty achievement, recognizing combined excellence in research, teaching, and service.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Bryan Gaensler applauded Smith's achievements, stating, "Professor Smith's dedication to advancing knowledge in his field and his commitment to the well-being of both the university and the broader community make him a truly outstanding faculty member, and a role model to us all."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over two decades, Smith's research has delved into the environmental and biological impacts of toxins on both children and adults. His studies have yielded groundbreaking insights into the functional impacts and neuromolecular mechanisms of toxic metals on neurodevelopment. These findings have not only deepened the understanding of environmentally-based behavioral disorders but also opened avenues for potential therapies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A notable figure in environmental health policy, Smith's advocacy efforts have resulted in the passage of two California State Assembly Bills. These bills ban the use of lead ammunition in hunting and provide protections for researchers against harassment. Smith's work has left a lasting impact, contributing to a healthier and more conscientious world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heart of Smith's research explores the diverse impacts of environmental toxins on health, emphasizing four main areas surrounding toxic metals. From understanding health impacts to exploring the mechanistic basis of environmentally-based diseases, biological markers of exposure, and therapies in humans and wildlife, Smith's work demonstrates a commitment to holistic research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith's collaborative efforts with Myra Finkelstein, his long-time colleague, translated research findings into tangible legislative action. Their work on wildlife toxicology, revealing the source of lead poisoning of scavenging birds like California Condors, prompted a statewide ban on lead bullets for hunting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond research and policy advocacy, Smith is a dedicated educator. Having devoted a significant part of his professional life to training graduate and undergraduate students, he continues to inspire and mentor students from a diverse range of backgrounds. Smith currently serves as the associate dean of graduate studies and postdoctoral affairs, and actively invests in service opportunities that enhance graduate education and student well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internationally recognized, Smith serves as an esteemed faculty member in the International PhD Program in Technology, Environment, and Health at the University of Brescia in Italy.

While water vapor has been detected in over a dozen planets to date, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/universe/exoplanets/webb-discovers-methane-carbon-dioxide-in-atmosphere-of-k2-18-b/">until recently</a> methane &#8211; a molecule found in abundance in the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune within our solar system &#8211; has remained elusive in the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets when studied with space-based spectroscopy. These findings have recently been published in the scientific journal Nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz professor of astronomy and astrophysics <a href="https://jfortney.sites.ucsc.edu/">Jonathan Fortney</a> and graduate student <a href="https://sagnickm.github.io/">Sagnick Murkherjee</a> created computer models of the planet's atmosphere that aided in the interpretation of the planet's spectrum. The detected methane is a sensitive probe of atmospheric temperatures. Fortney and Muckherjee showed that the planet WASP-80 b is just cool enough to have abundant methane, which hotter giant planets do not have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor Bell from the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (BAERI), working at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in in California&#8217;s Silicon Valley, and Luis Welbanks from Arizona State University tell us more about the significance of discovering methane in exoplanet atmospheres and discuss how Webb observations facilitated the identification of this long-sought-after molecule.&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></i></p>
<p><span>&#8220;With a temperature about 825 kelvins (about 1,025 degrees Fahrenheit), WASP-80 b is what scientists call a 'warm Jupiter,' which are planets that are similar in size and mass to the planet Jupiter in our solar system but have a temperature that&#8217;s in-between that of hot Jupiters, like the 1,450-K (2,150-F) HD 209458 b (the first transiting exoplanet discovered), and cold Jupiters, like our own which is about 125 K (235 F). WASP-80 b goes around its red dwarf star once every three days and is situated 163 light-years away from us in the constellation Aquila. Because the planet is so close to its star and both are so far away from us, we can't see the planet directly with even the most advanced telescopes like Webb. Instead, researchers study the combined light from the star and planet using the transit method (which has been used to discover most known exoplanets), and the eclipse method.</span></p>
<p><span>Using the transit method, we observed the system when the planet moved in front of its star from our perspective, causing the starlight we see to dim a bit. It&#8217;s kind of like when someone passes in front of a lamp and the light dims. During this time, a thin ring of the planet&#8217;s atmosphere around the planet&#8217;s day/night boundary is lit up by the star, and at certain colors of light where the molecules in the planet&#8217;s atmosphere absorb light, the atmosphere looks thicker and blocks more starlight, causing a deeper dimming compared to other wavelengths where the atmosphere appears transparent. This method helps scientists like us understand what the planet&#8217;s atmosphere is made of by seeing which colors of light are being blocked.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, using the eclipse method, we observed the system as the planet passed behind its star from our perspective, causing another small dip in the total light we received. All objects emit some light, called thermal radiation, with the intensity and color of the emitted light depending on how hot the object is. Just before and after the eclipse, the planet&#8217;s hot dayside is pointed toward us, and by measuring the dip in light during the eclipse we were able to measure the infrared light emitted by the planet. For eclipse spectra, absorption by molecules in the planet&#8217;s atmosphere typically appear as a reduction in the planet&#8217;s emitted light at specific wavelengths. Also, since the planet is much smaller and colder than its host star, the depth of an eclipse is much smaller than the depth of a transit.</span></p>
<p><span>The initial observations we made needed to be transformed into something we call a spectrum; this is essentially a measurement showing how much light is either blocked or emitted by the planet&#8217;s atmosphere at different colors (or wavelengths) of light. Many different tools exist to transform raw observations into useful spectra, so we used two different approaches to make sure our findings were robust to different assumptions. Next, we interpreted this spectrum using two kinds of models to simulate what the atmosphere of a planet under such extreme conditions would look like. The first type of model is entirely flexible, trying millions of combinations of methane and water abundances and temperatures to find the combination that best matches our data. The second type, called 'self-consistent models,' also explores millions of combinations but uses our existing knowledge of physics and chemistry to determine the levels of methane and water that could be expected. Both model types reached the same conclusion: a definitive detection of methane.</span></p>
<p><span>To validate our findings, we used robust statistical methods to evaluate the probability of our detection being random noise. In our field, we regard the 'gold standard&#8217; to be something called a &#8216;5-sigma detection,' meaning the odds of a detection being caused by random noise are 1 in 1.7 million. Meanwhile, we detected methane at 6.1-sigma in both the transit and eclipse spectra, which sets the odds of a spurious detection in each observation at 1 in 942 million, surpassing the 5-sigma 'gold standard,' and reinforcing our confidence in both detections.</span></p>
<p><span>With such a confident detection, not only did we find a very elusive molecule, but we can now start exploring what this chemical composition tells us about the planet&#8217;s birth, growth, and evolution. For example, by measuring the amount of methane and water in the planet, we can infer the ratio of carbon atoms to oxygen atoms. This ratio is expected to change depending on where and when planets form in their system. Thus, examining this carbon-to-oxygen ratio can offer clues as to whether the planet formed close to its star or farther away before gradually moving inward.</span></p>
<p><span>Another thing that has us excited about this discovery is the opportunity to finally compare planets outside of our solar system to those in it. NASA has a history of sending spacecraft to the gas giants in our solar system to measure the amount of methane and other molecules in their atmospheres. Now, by having a measurement of the same gas in an exoplanet, we can start to perform an 'apples-to-apples' comparison and see if the expectations from the solar system match what we see outside of it.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, as we look toward future discoveries with Webb, this result shows us that we are at the brink of more exciting findings. Additional <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=1177">MIRI</a> and <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=1185">NIRCam</a> observations of WASP-80 b with Webb will allow us to probe the properties of the atmosphere at different wavelengths of light. Our findings lead us to think that we will be able to observe other carbon-rich molecules such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, enabling us to paint a more comprehensive picture of the conditions in this planet&#8217;s atmosphere. Additionally, as we find methane and other gases in exoplanets, we will continue to expand our knowledge about how chemistry and physics works under conditions unlike what we have on Earth, and maybe sometime soon, in other planets that remind us of what we have here at home. One thing is clear &#8211; &#8212;the journey of discovery with the James Webb Space Telescope is brimming with potential surprises.&#8221;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linda Koval has supported UC Santa Cruz for nearly three decades, generously contributing her time and resources to create opportunities for Banana Slugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Supporting our students is my number one priority,&#8221; Koval says. &#8220;I want to impact students in as big a way as possible so they can impact the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koval understands the challenges students face and wants to help break down barriers that get in the way of their academic journey. She was a single, working mother in the early 1970s when a chance encounter with a neighbor&#8212;UCSC lecturer and former Santa Cruz city council member and mayor, Michael Rotkin&#8212;served as the catalyst for Koval to return to school. Koval says her conversation with Rotkin gave her the confidence she needed to apply to UCSC as a reentry student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She attended a satellite program at UCSC, going to classes in the evenings and on the weekends while working two part-time jobs and parenting her children. Koval graduated from Merrill College in 1976 with a degree in community studies. She then went on to graduate school at San Jose State University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel a great deal of gratitude for what I was allowed to do in a difficult situation,&#8221; Koval says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koval taught special education through the Santa Cruz County Office of Education for more than 30 years, ultimately becoming a head teacher, then a mentor teacher for graduate teachers from San Jose State University. After retiring, she consulted for the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, California State University, Monterey Bay, and several private schools for students with autism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Koval&#8217;s husband, Bob, died in 2017, she began looking for ways to stay busy and make new friends. She learned about the UC Santa Cruz Women&#8217;s Club, now Community Connections, and the group&#8217;s fundraising work for scholarships for re-entry students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew right away that was what I wanted to do,&#8221; Koval says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since joining Community Connections, Koval has served as a member at large, vice president, and is currently president. She says she has developed cherished friendships, learned new skills, and gained satisfaction from raising funds for student scholarships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love the work. I get the biggest sense of fulfillment seeing a student get through and graduate,&#8221; Koval says. &#8220;We can make a difference for students. They shouldn&#8217;t have to drop out because of financial concerns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She enjoys living close to campus, often swims at the pool, has coffee or lunch, and visits the Bay Tree Bookstore. Koval welcomes the opportunity to interact with students, stay connected, and see what&#8217;s going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are so many important things happening at UC Santa Cruz that affect the whole world,&#8221; Koval says. &#8220;UCSC graduates are making a global impact, especially in our sciences with cancer research and RNA/DNA work. It&#8217;s just amazing work. And I feel it&#8217;s extremely important to be connected to UC Santa Cruz as a donor as if I am playing a small part in the university&#8217;s success.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="12e0902f80727046323cb9f6df2d74e5"><name>alumni-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC Alumni Awards 2023 </title><summary>The Alumni Association at UCSC is proud to celebrate this year’s honorees of the UCSC Alumni Awards.</summary><start-date>1701158400000</start-date><display-name>alumni-awards</display-name><path>/2023/11/alumni-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/alumni-awards</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1701123756058</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701192212452</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/alumni-awards-2023.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/alumni-awards-2023.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-awards-2023.jpeg</name><display-name>alumni-awards-2023.jpeg</display-name><file-size>77491</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/alumni-awards-2023thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/alumni-awards-2023thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-awards-2023thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>alumni-awards-2023thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>14833</file-size><width>80</width><height>53</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>From left to right: Kenneth Marlow Watkins,&#160;<span>Gwenda Watkins Motley, and Angela Watkins Malone (accepting the alumni achievment award on behalf of their sister, bell hooks); Jim Lapsley, Bettina Aptheker, Abel Pineda, and Mark Phillips.&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/alumni-awards-2023-celebration.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/alumni-awards-2023-celebration.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>alumni-awards-2023-celebration.jpeg</name><display-name>alumni-awards-2023-celebration.jpeg</display-name><file-size>78065</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>The awardees were honored at the Alumni Awards Celebration on Oct. 27.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Celebrating all of the recipients from this year’s Alumni Awards

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumnus Leo Merle (Rachel Carson &#8217;20) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">won the gold medal in the Men&#8217;s T38 1500-meter race at the Parapan American Games on Nov. 21.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a time of 4:12.62, Merle defeated Canada&#8217;s Robert Stanley (4:13.60) and Columbia&#8217;s Jhonier Gomez (4:26.15) to earn the gold for the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.paralympic.org/santiago-2023"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parapan American Games Santiago 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are a key stop on the road to the Paralympic Games in Paris in 2024</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Parapan Games host the world's top competing para-athletes from the Americas and serves as a 2024 Paralympic qualifying round for many sports.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Going into it, there were a lot of expectations,&#8221; Merle said in a press release. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been training really hard this entire winter, so I just trusted the process and the training I did have. For me, it was just so important to make it as comfortable as possible for myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he was a student at UCSC, Merle competed as a Division III track and field athlete for four years where he participated in countless events and posted several competitive times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t until 2019, his third year of college, that Merle competed as a para-athlete for the first time in Minnesota at the U23 U.S. Nationals. Merle has cerebral palsy, a disorder that affects mobility, posture and balance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know about the broad spectrum of para-athletics until my junior year (of college) when I started doing the research and signing up for nationals and whatnot,&#8221; Merle told </span><a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/sports/united-states-paralympic-hopeful-leo-merle-joins-michigan-asaf/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Michigan Daily</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a 2021 article. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any special accommodations and I didn&#8217;t really think anything of it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merle went on to set the U23 national record for the 5k among T-38 (a disability sport classification for those with cerebral palsy) athletes in his first-ever race as a para-athlete.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After his gold medal win at the Parapan American Games, Merele has his eyes set on the 2024 Paris Paralympics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really enjoy that slow to fast pace, that kind of break-neck change, so for me it was exactly what I wanted and we executed the mission exactly as we wanted it to be done, and I can&#8217;t be happier or prouder of the performance.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="16c4ddbd80727046323cb9f6634d8d2d"><name>sv-certificate-upgrades</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Professional Education upgrades its Semiconductor and VLSI Engineering Certificate to address skilled professional shortage and industry growth</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Professional Education is proud to announce the upgrade of its Silicon Chip Design &amp;

Semiconductor Engineering Certificate program (Formerly known as VLSI and Semiconductor Engineering)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, aimed at alleviating the shortage of skilled professionals in the industry and meeting the growing demands of the semiconductor sector. This upgrade comes at a crucial time, as the Chips and Science Act of 2022 and the global restructuring of the semiconductor supply chain are projected to require 300,000 new professionals by 2030.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CHIPS Act, which sets aside $39 billion to encourage the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity, attract investments in advanced technologies, and promote U.S. technical leadership, has prompted many U.S. companies to launch plans for new facilities. Additionally, India has committed over $10 billion to stimulate chip manufacturing. These developments highlight the urgent need for a well-trained workforce to support the semiconductor industry's growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sustain California's leadership in the semiconductor industry, Governor Gavin Newsom has allocated $2 million to a Global Entrepreneur in Residence program at the University of California.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eris is about the size of Pluto but around 50% farther from the sun. The discovery of Eris in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune in 2005 prompted the debate that ultimately reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an interest in Pluto that drew UC Santa Cruz researcher Francis Nimmo to study Eris.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nimmo was visiting Michael Brown &#8212; one of the discoverers of Eris &#8212; at the California Institute of Technology about six months ago and realized some of Brown&#8217;s new, unpublished data could help reveal information about the properties of Eris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two worked on models for the next several months and published their results in a Science Advances paper last week. Two main pieces of information led to their results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first important clue is that Eris and its moon, Dysnomia, always face the same way toward each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That happens because the big planet gets spun down by the tides that the little moon raises on it,&#8221; explained Nimmo. &#8220;The bigger the moon is, the faster the planet spins down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers can use the spin and orbital characteristics of planets and their moons to infer properties of their internal structures. But until recently, scientists did not have an estimate for the size of Dysnomia.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown&#8217;s then-unpublished data changed that by revealing that Eris&#8217;s moon must be below a certain mass. This upper limit on mass provided the second crucial piece of information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And so as soon as you know that, then you can actually start to do real calculations,&#8221; said Nimmo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main, unexpected result of Nimmo and Brown&#8217;s model is that Eris is surprisingly dissipative, or &#8220;squishy&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-authors determined that Eris has a rocky core surrounded by a layer of ice. This outer shell of ice is likely convecting, unlike the conducting shell of Pluto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rock contains radioactive elements, and those produce heat. And then that heat has to get out somehow,&#8221; explained Nimmo. &#8220;So as the heat escapes, it drives this slow churning in the ice.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eris therefore behaves less like a rigid object and &#8220;more like a soft cheese or something like that. It has a tendency to flow a bit,&#8221; said Nimmo.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Future Data</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upper limit on the mass of Dysnomia came from measurements made by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope. Nimmo hopes that soon, more exact measurements of the mass will help further refine the model.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If Dysnomia is smaller than that, then Eris is even more squishy,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional data about the shape of Eris will help verify the model Nimmo and Brown created.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We make the point that Eris should be pretty smooth because if there&#8217;s any surface topography, the ice is going to flow and that topography will go away,&#8221; said Nimmo. &#8220;So it would be nice to get some measurements of what shape Eris is because if it&#8217;s very irregular, that would not agree with our model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eris is so distant from Earth that it shows up as a single pixel, so in order to reconstruct its shape, scientists will need to watch the planet pass in front of stars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The star blinks out and then the star comes back, and that tells you how wide Eris is at that point. And if you do that with a whole bunch of stars, then you can actually reconstruct shape,&#8221; explained Nimmo. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping people are actually doing it, I just don&#8217;t know whether they are.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="16d1431f80727046323cb9f670763357"><name>visits-director-athletics-recreation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Visits set for Director of Athletics &amp; Recreation candidates</title><summary>Beginning Monday, December 11 and continuing through Friday, December 15, campus will conduct final in-person interviews in the search for the director of Athletics &amp; Recreation. </summary><start-date>1701158400000</start-date><display-name>Visits set for Director of Athletics &amp; Recreation candidates</display-name><path>/2023/11/visits-director-athletics-recreation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/visits-director-athletics-recreation</link><created-by>sgmessic</created-by><created-on>1701189862157</created-on><last-modified-by>sgmessic</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701810925029</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning Monday, December 11 and continuing through Friday, December 15, campus will conduct final in-person interviews in the search for the director of Athletics &amp; Recreation.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new building, referred to as the Interdisciplinary Instruction and Research Building (IIRB), will house state-of-the-art laboratories for undergraduate instruction in biology, chemistry, and physics, as well as interdisciplinary uses. Early design includes a feasibility study to confirm the best site location on Science and Engineering Hill. The new teaching laboratories in the IIRB will address over-utilization and new enrollments, as well as the campus&#8217;s urgent need for relocation space to facilitate seismic projects at the 1965 Thimann Laboratories and other older campus buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design process is being led by </span><a href="https://www.ennead.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ennead Architects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who recently completed similar projects at Stanford University, University of Texas at Austin, and Vassar College. The current phase picks up from the campus engagement, and programming and visioning work, completed during the earlier pre-design phase. The design team is continuing to work together with the building users and campus stakeholders to assure that the new IIRB will best serve the UCSC campus community and meet the UCSC mission and Principles of Community. Bryan Gaensler, dean of the Science Division, is chairing the campus Programming and Building Committee for the IIRB project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project vision aligns closely with campuswide goals in </span><a href="https://strategicplan.ucsc.edu"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The project vision for the IIRB states: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new IIRB prioritizes equity and inclusion by demystifying &amp; diversifying scientific instruction and student research and inviting students to create their own scientific identities and be at home in the sciences.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IIRB is being designed to support the priorities of being approachable, accessible, comfortable, and welcoming to the entire student body. The building and site design will encourage collaboration and academic success, with attention to those not equitably represented in the sciences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee will provide updates throughout the preliminary plans process, and PPDO will post updates to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projects in Design</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their website beginning in 2024.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

prototype of their new <a href="https://www.ednaexplorer.org/about">eDNA Explorer</a>. This open-source tool provides a powerful and easily accessible platform for sharing, exploring, and analyzing data from projects that use environmental DNA.&#160;<br/><br/>Environmental DNA, or eDNA, is a tool for monitoring biodiversity that involves analyzing DNA found in soil or water samples from a specific location to determine which species are present in that area. For the past several years, CALeDNA has been using this technique to sample regions across the state of California.&#160;<br/><br/>The CALeDNA program is directed by Rachel Meyer, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and an affiliate of the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute. CALeDNA has led collections of eDNA in Swanton Pacific Ranch after it was devastated by wildfires, the LA River, farms in the Central Valley, and a host of other locations.&#160;<br/><br/>Although CALeDNA started in California, it has grown to have a global reach. A recent project involved running research-based workshops on using eDNA to guide rewilding in Rwanda, in which managers of Akagera National Park collaborate with scientists from Rwandan and other African environmental organizations and universities to analyze the data together. Data from all of these sites and more than a dozen other projects throughout the U.S. and Africa are now visible to the public on eDNA Explorer.&#160;<br/><br/>Julie Stanford, who co-created the eDNA Explorer, is excited for the opportunity it will give the community to make a real impact on the global biodiversity crisis.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This first version is just the beginning of a series of tools that we are launching to illuminate the hidden creatures in our ecosystems and provide insights on the biodiversity we are trying to protect,&#8221; Stanford said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to collaborate with everyone on this platform.&#8221;<br/><br/>The web tool serves as a project management and collaboration platform that helps people figure out where rare species are and how communities change across space and time. One popular species is the elusive African barred owlet, which turned up in an eDNA sample with a match to the genus Glaucidium, the group for all pygmy owls.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;The African barred owlet had last been recorded in 1981,&#8221; said Drew Bantlin, Conservation and Research Manager at African Parks. &#8220;In 2021, we recorded multiple calls and then sighted multiple individuals that appeared to be resident in a single drainage line in the north-central part of the park. Finding DNA from the south side of the park suggests the species is more widespread than thought.&#8221;<br/><br/>The CALeDNA project has relied on heavy involvement from citizen scientists, and the eDNA Explorer tool is designed so that it can be used by beginners and experts alike. It creates a common format for data and converts raw project sequence data uploaded by researchers, park managers, and others into a reliable organism list in the cloud. It also facilitates comparing eDNA data with that from more traditional observational methods of biomonitoring.<br/><br/>eDNA only lasts for an average of two weeks before it is degraded, so it provides a good sense of the current inhabitants of a given area. In some regions, researchers have been able to extract older, more degraded DNA from preserved areas (for instance from under the concrete of the LA River), to find what species used to be in an area.&#160;<br/><br/>It is not a perfect science, however. Looking through the eDNA Explorer&#8217;s list of species that are present in the LA River, for example, one can find the presence of bovine DNA. This is not because there are actually cows roaming the river, but because bovine DNA gets into the river through human waste. This is an example of what scientists refer to as &#8220;noise&#8221; in the data. As tools like the eDNA Explorer make eDNA data more accessible, Meyer predicts that scientists will learn how to better sift through the results to quickly answer specific questions about conservation.<br/><br/>&#8220;As we explore eDNA regardless of the noise, there is a lot of promise,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It works really well for answering a specific question, like &#8216;where in Compton Creek are there invasive clawed frogs?&#8217; That&#8217;s a question anyone can answer now by downloading the data from our Explorer tool, and we can use that information to aid efforts to target interventions in specific areas.&#8221;<br/><br/>The tool also allows users to find information on specific organisms, projects in their area, and even the people who have worked on those projects and their methodology, like a &#8220;LinkedIn for eDNA,&#8221; as Meyer describes it. The tool is designed to remove the barriers to designing protocols and analyzing environmental data, with the ultimate goal of providing a better understanding of the living world.<br/><br/>&#8220;We recently had a State of the Los Angeles River Watershed Symposium, and we had government officials looking for pathogens to decide if it is safe for humans to fish in certain areas, conservation groups who are restoring natural habitats, and tribal leaders trying to envision what the LA river should be and how to make it a happier space for humans and wildlife,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;eDNA is helping us answer all of these questions, and this tool will help us to expand our collaborations to encompass even more areas of exploration.&#8221;<br/><br/>With the eDNA Explorer launched, Meyer said the next step is training more people how to use it. She and other CALeDNA researchers just returned from a second Rwanda workshop in Nyungwe National Park, and are currently in South African surveying rivers with eDNA that runs through agricultural land. The local farmers of the cape winelands will be invited to join eDNA Explorer to dive into the biodiversity of their local habitats. With unprecedented flooding in South Africa this year, eDNA can be a useful tool to find species that may help the rivers and adjacent lands stabilize and recover.</p>

<p><br/>&#8220;I am really excited about what this tool will allow researchers, and even just interested citizens, to understand about the land we all call home,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;We are just at the beginning of seeing what it can make possible. It gives me a lot of hope.&#8221;&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Seeing how Professor Meyer and her team have brought the power and potential of genomics, high-throughput data generation, and analysis to conservation is incredibly exciting,&#8221; said Lauren Linton Executive Director, UCSC Genomics Institute. "At the Genomics Institute we are actively expanding our view and impact in many ways. It is fantastic to see Rachel blaze this important trail at a crucial time for conservation efforts.&#8221;&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers behind eDNA Explorer invite anyone to visit the tool, explore the data, and upload their own sequences. The project was made possible through the generous support of Oceankind, and the workshops in Rwanda were funded by grants from National Geographic and the JRS Foundation to lead investigator Ren Larison at UCLA.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="17ed47ca807270463319b43e39589fe6"><name>chancellor-aau</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Chancellor Larive elected to board of the Association of American Universities</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive has been elected to serve on the Board of Directors of the Association of American Universities (AAU).</summary><start-date>1701158400000</start-date><display-name>AAU Board</display-name><path>/2023/11/chancellor-aau</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/chancellor-aau</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1701208475574</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701208475574</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive has been elected to serve on the Board of Directors of the <a href="https://www.aau.edu">Association of American Universities</a> (AAU).</p>

Cruz students won a gold medal at the 2023 International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Grand Jamboree, marking their fourth consecutive year of bringing home the prize, and were nominated as best software tool for the first time. The annual iGEM competition brings together student teams from around the world to present synthetic biology projects that aim to address 21st century societal challenges.<br/><br/>The 2023 UCSC iGEM team&#8217;s project, called the <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/ucsc/">Toxic Algal Bloom Interference (TABI)</a>, centered on addressing harmful algal blooms in local Watsonville&#8217;s Pinto Lake, creating a solution that could also be applied globally to similar environmental problems. <br/><br/>The competition was the culmination of months of dedication to the project, which included brainstorming, fundraising, building a project website, software development, local outreach, research, and, of course, wet lab work. Students on the iGEM team take four courses and dedicate a summer to working around 40 hours a week in the lab, gaining deep experience and a passion for research and developing a tight-knit community. The 14 UCSC students on the iGEM team and one iGEM intern from Hartnell College traveled to Paris, France with their advisor, Baskin Engineering Associate Teaching Professor, David Bernick and Teaching Assistant Gia Balius.<br/><br/><strong>Presenting in Paris</strong><br/><br/>This year&#8217;s iGEM competition was the second in-person Jamboree after the pandemic, giving the students the opportunity to connect and bond with other students enthusiastic about synthetic biology from around the world who have also gone through the rigorous iGEM process. The UCSC iGEM team was in the iGEM Jamboree &#8220;project village&#8221; with the theme of bioremediation, meaning they mostly interfaced with other groups working in similar areas. <br/><br/>&#8220;You go through the project with just your team members, and you don't realize how much else is out there, what other people are doing, that they're going through the same path with you,&#8221; said Nikita Rajesh, a biomolecular engineering student on the iGEM team. &#8220;It feels very approachable because it&#8217;s peer to peer and they&#8217;ve been through this experience, too. You already have the connection going in. So within like five minutes, you've made a new friend.&#8221;<br/><br/>The Jamboree also provides opportunities to network with representatives from industry and government who also attend the competition and are often interested in transforming the ideas presented into startups.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something that people don&#8217;t really know is that the field of synthetic biology&#160;grows from iGEM,&#8221; Bernick said. &#8220;Not only are students getting trained in this field, it&#8217;s also throwing new ideas out there. All of the topic areas are attempting to in some way address some of the most critical problems that exist, and so everything that is being invented is something that is intended to make a big difference in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time in ten years of iGEM history at UCSC, the team was nominated for best software tool, a recognition for teams whose projects did not purely focus on software itself but rather as a complementary component of the project.<br/><br/>&#8220;It excited us because there&#8217;s a very small number of teams that get nominated for the software awards,&#8221; said Varun Kodur, a molecular, cell, and developmental Biology student and co-captain of the 2023 iGEM team. &#8220;Getting a gold for iGEM is something that we've been thankfully able to do with our team for the past four years, but this is the first time we got a nomination in software.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Addressing algal blooms</strong><br/><br/>The 2023 UCSC iGEM team focused their project on toxic algal blooms at Watsonville&#8217;s Pinto Lake, which has been used for community recreation and is home to more than 130 bird species. With this project, the iGEM team became the first group of researchers to consider synthetic biology as an intervention strategy at Pinto Lake.<br/><br/>&#8220;Watsonville is a low-income community surrounded by agriculture. The project directly impacts not only people who can relate to these communities &#8211; I myself come from a community like that &#8212; but it also brings about this recognition that these are communities that are providing our food but are living in a state where they don&#8217;t necessarily have the socioeconomic mobility to bring about change themselves,&#8221; said Danny Cruz, a biomolecular engineering student on the iGEM team. &#8220;We are giving back to that community, and being able to provide something after they've provided so much for us for so long.&#8221;<br/><br/>Pinto Lake has seen toxic algal blooms for the past four decades due to high levels of phosphates in agricultural runoff. Similar algal blooms are found in bodies of water around the globe, becoming more toxic and pervasive due to warming temperatures from climate change. Exposure to these algal blooms can be extremely harmful to humans and animals, potentially causing severe sickness and death. <br/><br/>While other efforts to remove the toxic blooms revolve around killing off all the algae in the environment, the iGEM team&#8217;s approach targets the harmful genes of the specific bacteria responsible for the algal blooms, called Microcystis aeruginosa, creating a non-invasive, long-term solution to preserve biodiversity, ecosystem balance, and public health. Their approach uses synthetic biology to disrupt the toxic genes within the bacteria that causes the algal blooms. <br/><br/>The team set out to solve this with a plasmid, an extrachromosomal DNA molecule, but determined that they needed a way to evade the bacteria&#8217;s native immunity in order for a plasmid to be able to efficiently transform the cell and target the harmful elements. <br/><br/>However, Microcystis aeruginosa is not a model organism, meaning it is not commonly studied in the lab and therefore lacks an existing body of scientific research on the specifics of its genome, which made it harder to find out how to get past that native immunity. They realized other scientists studying other non-model species would likely face similar barriers, presenting a laborious and time-consuming challenge for the field of synthetic biology. <br/><br/>&#8220;We knew we wanted our project to contribute to the community meaningfully, not just demonstrate engineering success in a lab,&#8221; said Jordan Nichols, a neuroscience and biomolecular engineering student and iGEM team co-captain. &#8220;We decided to tackle the problem of scale before we implemented an engineering solution, and to do that we developed this software that pretty generically makes engineering non-model species much easier.&#8221; <br/><br/>This led them to their solution: a software tool called Chameleon which helps identify how plasmids can be designed to best evade the bacterial immunity of their target. It does this by running a statistical analysis to determine which elements, called motifs, of the plasmid are most likely to be targeted by the immune system and then removes those motifs without changing the function of the plasmid. <br/><br/>Chameleon expands on Stealth, software developed by Bernick which is <a href="https://ucsc.portals.in-part.com/nxPgW6AaN6Gk?utm_source=technologies&amp;utm_medium=portal&amp;utm_term=latest">available for licensing</a>. Stealth runs the statistical analysis of determining problematic motifs in a plasmid to more holistically avoid the target bacteria&#8217;s native immunity. In building Chameleon, the iGEM team focused on efficiency, simplicity, and accessibility throughout their software design.<br/><br/>With this software, they were able to better engineer their plasmid to disrupt toxin production without detection by the bacteria. They hope other scientists will be empowered to use Chameleon to come up with solutions to toxic blooms in their community. While the team spread the word about their tool at the iGEM Jamboree, they also hope to expand its reach into the wider synthetic biology community.<br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to catalyze the adoption of this by making it easier for more people to use, lower the bar of entry, and put it in the hands of other people,&#8221; said James Larbalestier, a molecular, cell, and developmental Biology student and iGEM team member.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the iGEM team is actively excited about carrying forward their project now that the Jamboree is over. They want to continue to test their idea for disrupting toxin production in the lab. They are hoping to publish a scientific paper on their work through an iGEM collection within the Frontiers family of journals. They also want to further develop their software, to make it easier to use and more effective. <br/><br/>Beyond this, the 2023 iGEM team collaborated with UC Berkeley to help the school set up a iGEM team to compete in the Jamboree in future years. Although Berkeley does have an iGEM team already, they do not currently send students to the competition. <br/><br/>The complete 2023 UCSC iGEM team includes: Gia Balius, Srikar Bevara, Danny Cruz, Blanca Davila Gil, Tyler Gaw, Ashlyn Huynh, Allison Jaballas, Varun Kodur, James Larbalestier, Daniel Li, Zokhira Mukhammadyunusova, Jordan Nichols, Nikita Rajesh, Julia Saltz, and Katie Warren.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1cea206e807270465b6f0d0482097972"><name>curtailment-time-reporting</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>2023/2024 Winter Campus Curtailment Time Reporting in CruzPay</title><summary>Winter Campus Curtailment occurs this year from Monday, December 25, 2023 through Monday, January 1, 2024. </summary><start-date>1701244800000</start-date><display-name>2023/2024 Winter Campus Curtailment Time Reporting in CruzPay</display-name><path>/2023/11/curtailment-time-reporting</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/curtailment-time-reporting</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1701292154959</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701292154959</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>Winter Campus Curtailment occurs this year from Monday, December 25, 2023 through Monday, January 1, 2024.&#160; The designated university holidays are December 25, 26, 29, and January 1, 2024 and the designated curtailment dates are December 27, 28.

(Photo courtesy of Yu Zhang)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>It&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s become all too familiar &#8212; high winds knock out a power line, and a community can go without power for hours to days, an inconvenience at best and a dangerous situation at worst. UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Yu Zhang and his lab are leveraging tools to improve the efficiency, reliability, and resilience of power systems, and have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) -based approach for the smart control of microgrids for power restoration when outages occur.&#160;<br/><br/>They describe their new AI model and show that it outperforms traditional power restoration techniques in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10334063">new paper</a> published in the journal <em>IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems</em>, a top journal in the field of control systems and network science. Shourya Bose, a Ph.D. student in Zhang&#8217;s lab, is the paper&#8217;s first author.<br/><br/>&#8220;Nowadays, microgrids are really the thing that both people in industry and in academia are focusing on for the future power distribution systems,&#8221; Zhang said.<br/><br/>In many communities, infrastructure and its users are totally reliant on a local power generating utility company for electricity. This means that in the case of a disaster or extreme weather event, or even just a tree falling on a line, power goes out until repairs can be made.&#160;<br/><br/>Today, many electricity systems are smart in that they are interconnected with computers and sensors. They often incorporate local renewable energy sources such as rooftop solar panels or small wind turbines, and some households and buildings rely on backup generators and/or energy batteries for their electricity demand.&#160;<br/><br/>This mix of power sources presents an opportunity to address outages locally by using alternative energy sources to provide electricity before upstream power is restored. One way to do this is with a microgrid, which distributes electricity to small areas such as a few buildings or a town &#8212; although the size of the microgrid can vary.&#160;<br/><br/>The microgrid can be connected to the main power utility source, but also can function while disconnected in &#8220;islanding mode,&#8221; self-supported by alternate energy sources and unaffected by the issues impacting the main utility. Zhang&#8217;s research team focuses on optimizing how microgrids pull from these various alternate sources such as renewables, generators, and batteries to restore power quickly and correctly.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Essentially, we want to bring the power generation closer to the demand side in order to get rid of the long transmission lines,&#8221; Zhang said. &#8220;This can improve the power quality and reduce the power losses over the lines. In this way, we will make the grid smaller, but stronger and more resilient.&#8221;<br/><br/>To optimally operate microgrids, Zhang&#8217;s lab developed an AI-based technique called deep reinforcement learning, the same concept that underpins large language models, to create an efficient framework&#160; that includes models of many components of the power system. Reinforcement learning depends on rewarding the algorithm for successfully responding to the changing environment&#160; &#8212;&#160; so an agent&#160; is rewarded when it is able to successfully restore the demanded power of all components of the network. They explicitly model the practical constraints of the real-world system, such as the branch flows that power lines can handle.<br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re modeling a whole bunch of things &#8212; solar, wind, small generators, batteries, and we're also modeling when people's electricity demand changes,&#8221; Bose said. &#8220;The novelty is that this specific flavor of reinforcement learning, which we call constrained policy optimization (CPO), is being used for the first time.&#8221;<br/><br/>Their CPO approach takes into account real-time conditions and uses machine learning to find long-term patterns that affect the output of renewables, such as the varying demand on the grid at a given time and intermittent weather factors that affect renewable sources. This is unlike traditional systems which often use a technique called model predictive control (MPC) that bases decisions simply on the available conditions at the time of optimization.&#160;<br/><br/>For example, if the CPO method predicts that the sun will shine brightly in an hour, it would use up its supply of solar energy with the knowledge that it will later be replenished&#160;&#8212; a different strategy than it might take if the day was cloudy. It can also learn about the system based on long-term patterns of how the grid uses solar.<br/><br/>The researchers found that their CPO technique significantly outperforms traditional MPC methods when the forecasts of renewable sources are lower than the reality because of its better understanding of all the possible solar profiles throughout any given day.&#160;<br/><br/>They also found that the reinforcement learning controller is able respond much faster than traditional optimization methods in the moment of a power outage.&#160;<br/><br/>The research team recently proved the success of their method when they placed first in a global competition that invited participants to use reinforcement learning or similar techniques to operate a power grid. The competition, called L2RPN Delft 2023, was co-sponsored by France&#8217;s electricity transmission system operator (R&#233;seau de Transport d'&#201;lectricit&#233;), which the UC Santa Cruz researchers see as an indicator that now large-scale grid operators may start moving toward AI and renewable energy techniques.<br/><br/>Now that they&#8217;ve developed a successful algorithm in simulations, the research team is working to test their model on microgrids in their lab. In the long-term, the researchers hope to implement their solution on the UC Santa Cruz campus&#8217;s energy system to address outage issues that the residential campus community faces. They also hope to see further interest and collaboration from industry.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="225a0a888072704615e9b73d1b1f1461"><name>rowland-rebele</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Philanthropist and advocate Rowland Rebele dies at age 93</title><summary>Rowland Rebele, a distinguished publisher, philanthropist, homeless advocate, and unwavering supporter of the arts, died Saturday, Nov. 25, at the age of 93.

His indomitable spirit and fervent commitment to Santa Cruz have left an indelible imprint on both the community and the UC Santa Cruz campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowland and his wife, Pat, were active supporters of UC Santa Cruz for more than four decades, providing valuable advice to campus leaders as well as generous financial support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Rowland Rebele's influence on UC Santa Cruz has been broad and deep," said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. "Every future artist, social-justice leader, engineer and scientist who passes through our doors will continue to be beneficiaries of Rowland&#8217;s generosity, passion, and vision. He and Pat have been instrumental in transforming our campus."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rebeles created the Patricia and Rowland Rebele Endowed Chair in History of Art and Visual Culture and the Rebele Art History Endowment at the University Library. A gift of $1 million was used to jumpstart the Institute of the Arts and Sciences at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their philanthropy extended to a wide variety of campus programs, including the Genomics Institute, where a recent gift is still helping researchers and health-care providers understand the COVID-19 genome. They also supported the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery, UC Santa Cruz Opera, the Arboretum, the University Center, Arts &amp; Lectures, the Pacific Rim Music Festival, and Friends of Long Marine Laboratory.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple&#8217;s impact on the campus was recognized in 2009 when they were given the Fiat Lux Award at the Founders Day gala. The award is given by the UC Santa Cruz Foundation to alumni and friends who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, dedication, and service in support of the university's programs and goals. The Rebeles were honored for their extraordinary support of the arts and education and their vital role as advocates for the homeless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowland Rebele, a prominent figure in Santa Cruz for decades, engaged in philanthropic endeavors that spanned a wide spectrum, touching numerous organizations and individuals through direct donations, scholarships, and various forms of support. The couple were key contributors to the River Street homeless center, now bearing their name, showcasing their commitment to addressing societal challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowland Rebele was born in San Francisco. He met Pat in middle school there. After obtaining his education at Stanford University and Harvard Business School, he served in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. He went on to manage several small newspapers in California, maintaining an avid interest in journalism throughout his life. Roughly 40 years ago, the Rebeles transitioned from the newspaper business to retirement in Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rowland Rebele is survived by wife Pat, children Marianne, Andrew, and Chris, as well as an extended circle of family and friends. Memorial service details are pending.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4bc7de1d807270467ad000d6b5ea7ca9"><name>ucpath-direct-deposit-phishing-alers</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCPath Direct Deposit Phishing Alert</title><summary>There is an ongoing phishing attempt targeting UC employees that aims to gain access to your paycheck and reroute your direct deposit.</summary><start-date>1701244800000</start-date><display-name>UCPath Direct Deposit Phishing Alert</display-name><path>/2023/11/ucpath-direct-deposit-phishing-alers</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/11/ucpath-direct-deposit-phishing-alers</link><created-by>sgmessic</created-by><created-on>1702078438916</created-on><last-modified-by>sgmessic</last-modified-by><last-modified>1702078438916</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation" width="100%">
