</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Mathews began working at UC Santa Cruz in 1970; 52 years later, he is remembered by his students, friends, and colleagues as a dedicated and dynamic astronomer and mentor. An inspiration and friend of many, Bill </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/12/mathews-in-memoriam.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed away in September 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His daughter, Amey Mathews &#8212;an artist and yoga instructor&#8212;took ownership of thousands of pages of Bill&#8217;s old notes, covered in calculations and commentary. </span><a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2023/03/a-page-at-a-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amey began weaving portraits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of her father into and over the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes, drawing out Bill&#8217;s presence on the pages.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notes&#8212;typically dense calculations written on 8&#189;-by-11-inch paper, galactic images, or even Post-its&#8212;gradually evolved into a most unique kind of canvas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A curated selection of Amey&#8217;s work currently lives on the </strong><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/03/faber-sullivan-fireside-library-feature.html"><strong>Sandra M. Faber Floor</strong></a><strong> (third floor) of the Science and Engineering Library at UC Santa Cruz and is open to all. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amey says she is grateful to have this space dedicated to her father.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m so thrilled to have this work here,&#8221; Amey said at a private reception for the exhibit. &#8220;I really love having it here at the library, I love having it here on campus, and I love having it in a place of contemplation and active thinking and learning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit is entitled &#8220;Big Questions: Astronomer Father/Artist Daughter&#8221; and will remain on display through Spring quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All of these are notes that my dad took not very many feet from here for 50-plus years,&#8221; Amey said at the Science and Engineering Library. &#8220;So it feels really meaningful to share him and his work in this context and in this place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill contributed fundamental knowledge to understanding some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe. He employed atomic physics and hydrodynamics to understand luminous interstellar gas clouds&#8212;glowing nebulae&#8212;that formed because of phenomena such as the remnants of dying stars in the galaxy and quasars expelling energetic gasses.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His early work focused on how dust forms in galactic gas clouds, and by the 1970s, his work had advanced our fundamental understanding of various types of glowing nebulae.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His legacy includes more than 200 publications in professional journals and conference proceedings. In addition to his work in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, Bill had a lifelong interest in music and taught a popular course at UCSC on the physics of music.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He was an enthusiastic person about life, about science, and about his family&#8212;he just had a lot of enthusiasm,&#8221; Amey said. &#8220;I started coming out to my art space and sitting with all of these papers, my memory of him, my love for him, and his love of this subject&#8212;it was such a meaningful part of his life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill is also remembered by The Bill Mathews Fund for Excellence in Astronomy and Astrophysics which was established by Cynthia Mathews to support current graduate students and attract outstanding graduate student candidates to the department. Cynthia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;former Santa Cruz mayor, long-term city council member, and Santa Cruz Planned Parenthood co-founder&#8212;was married to Bill for 57 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund supports graduate program fellowships, individual graduate student research programs, travel funds for graduate students to attend meetings and deliver talks, and participation in collaborations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was clear he always wanted this to happen,&#8221; Cynthia said. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s career in astronomy and astrophysics was enormously rewarding to him. He was grateful to work in such a&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continually exciting field with wonderful colleagues; he wanted to invest in future&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">generations of astronomers to carry on.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

The event will start at 7 p.m. and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdY-aDkj2k3R42UZLHCEdyDw9Q_-ODWtc5FJDS08-f96QunEA/viewform">advance registration</a> is encouraged.</p>
<p>Sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Astrobiology and Science Communication programs, the lecture will first frame the discussion of looking for extraterrestrial life in the context of the famed 1961 Drake equation, a framework that connects physical, chemical, and biological processes with the development of detectable civilizations within our own galaxy. The speakers will then cover three ways in which NASA&#8217;s science program focuses on identifying signatures of life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
<p>The lecture will be followed by a moderated discussion with time for questions.</p>
<p>Thomas H. Zurbuchen, known in the space community as &#8220;Dr. Z,&#8221; is the longest continually serving head of science at NASA, a post he held from October 2016 through the end of 2022. As NASA associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, he was responsible for all aspects of NASA leadership in space science. During his tenure, NASA launched 37 science missions and started 54, including the James Webb Space Telescope, two Mars landings, the Ingenuity helicopter, the Parker Solar Probe, and the DART mission. Zurbuchen also conceived and led the Earth System Observatory, an advanced multi-platform observatory that creates a 3D holistic view of the Earth, from bedrock to atmosphere. He is a member of the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences, recipient of the NASA Outstanding Service Medal, associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and recipient of the Presidential Rank Award, Distinguished Level.</p>
<p>Nadia Drake is the senior physics editor at <em>Quanta</em> magazine and a graduate of the UCSC Science Communication Program. Her father, SETI pioneer Frank Drake, developed the Drake equation and was a professor of astronomy and astrophysics and dean of natural sciences at UCSC. Nadia Drake specializes in covering astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary science, as well as anything involving jungles and spiders. Her byline has also appeared in <em>National Geographic, Atlantic, Nature, New York Times, Science News, Wired,</em> and <em>Scientific American,</em> for which she recently led coverage of NASA&#8217;s Artemis I moon mission. From an early age, she has been a keen observer of the search for life beyond Earth&#8212;a field that is grounded in the early work of her father. Now, somewhat serendipitously, much of her journalistic work focuses on astrobiology, the search for life&#8217;s origins on Earth and beyond. She is also a member of NASA&#8217;s panel that is investigating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). She has won many awards for her work, including recognition from the American Astronomical Society&#8217;s divisions of planetary science and high-energy astrophysics.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>04-18-2023</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="491422dd80727046088bfaea363e72ad"><name>bruland-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Ocean scientist Kenneth Bruland recognized for pioneering research paper</title><summary>The 2023 John H.

Martin Award from the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography celebrates an influential 1998 paper on the role of iron in coastal ecosystems</article-subhead><article-text><p>Kenneth Bruland, professor emeritus of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, is known for his pioneering research on the role of iron and other trace elements in the growth of phytoplankton, the microscopic algae that form the base of marine food webs. In 1998, Bruland and coauthor David Hutchins, then at the University of Delaware, published an influential paper on iron as a limiting nutrient in coastal ecosystems, for which they are now being recognized by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) with the 2023 John H. Martin Award.</p>
<p>The Martin Award is given to one paper each year that has led to fundamental shifts in research focus and interpretation of a large body of previous observations. It will be presented to Hutchins and Bruland during the 2023 ASLO Aquatic Sciences Meeting in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in June 2023.</p>
<p>The 1998 paper by Hutchins and Bruland, &#8220;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/31203">Iron-limited diatom growth and Si:N uptake ratios in a coastal upwelling regime</a>,&#8221; was published in <em>Nature</em>. The authors examined factors that constrain the flow of carbon through ecosystems&#8212;an integral part of limnology and oceanography&#8212;focusing on areas along the central coast of California where coastal upwelling brings deep water to the surface. They showed that the availability of iron limits the growth of phytoplankton in these areas. At the time, such limitations were not thought to exist in these otherwise nutrient-rich coastal upwelling zones.</p>
<p>In addition, Hutchins and Bruland provided insight on the effects of iron availability in relation to silica to nitrogen ratios, and how this shapes diatom communities and eventual carbon export. With more than 1,100 citations to date, the paper has been incorporated into countless introductory textbooks and remains a foundational paper in aquatic science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hutchins and Bruland&#8217;s examination of iron availability, as well as silica and nitrogen assimilation, has fundamentally shifted our understanding of coastal primary production and nutrient biogeochemistry,&#8221; said ASLO President Patricia Glibert. &#8220;Twenty-five years later, Hutchins and Bruland (1998) continues to be an integral paper that has guided our understanding on coastal primary production and a must-read for students and seasoned researchers alike.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4d66f5fa80727046374e87f83dee14f7"><name>fairlie-economic-report-of-the-president</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>White House cites Rob Fairlie’s research in annual economic report</title><summary>Economics Professor Rob Fairlie’s research on race and ethnicity in higher education was cited in the 2023 Economic Report of the President.</summary><start-date>1680591600000</start-date><path>/2023/04/fairlie-economic-report-of-the-president</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/fairlie-economic-report-of-the-president</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1680630805990</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1680637910787</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/08/images/rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/08/images/rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</name><display-name>rob-fairlie-300px.jpg</display-name><file-size>168973</file-size><width>435</width><height>298</height></image><image-alt>professional portrait of Rob Fairlie</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2020/08/images/fairlie-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2020/08/images/fairlie-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fairlie-80px.jpg</name><display-name>fairlie-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>14014</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>professional portrait of Rob Fairlie</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Economics Professor Rob Fairlie</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics Professor Rob Fairlie&#8217;s research was cited in the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ERP-2023.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Economic Report of the President,</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transmitted to Congress from the White House in March. Chapter five of the report focuses on &#8220;building stronger postsecondary institutions,&#8221; and a section on the benefits of college argues that reducing racial disparities in college attainment can help to address problems associated with underrepresentation in fields like teaching and medicine. As an example, the report mentions a 2014 research paper by Fairlie as evidence &#8220;that students benefit from exposure to instructors of the same race.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairlie&#8217;s prior paper, published in the </span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.8.2567"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Economic Review</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, studied outcomes at a large, diverse community college over a five-year period. The research showed that performance gaps between white students and underrepresented minority students on measures like grades and class drop-out rates fell by 20 to 50 percent when courses were taught by an instructor from an underrepresented minority. There were also positive impacts on student retention and degree completion.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, April 12, the campus will host its first Land Acknowledgment event, recognizing </span><a href="https://amahmutsun.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its place in the local history of the land and the creation of UC Santa Cruz. The event will aim to answer the community&#8217;s questions about land acknowledgments, and the importance of such events moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted both online and in person beginning at 3 p.m. at Stevenson Event Center, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s own Community Archivist Dr. Rebecca Hernandez will be joined by Amah Mutsun Tribal Band Chairman Valentin Lopez and tribal member Alexii Sigona to discuss more about the acknowledgement and the relationship between the two groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really wanted to give the opportunity to the tribe to speak for themselves,&#8221; said Hernandez. &#8220;They are the experts; they are the people who really should be talking about it and sharing about their history.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before taking on the role as the community archivist in January 2022, Hernandez was previously the director of the campus&#8217;s American Indian Resource Center. Through that role and others in the community &#8212;&#160;including her work with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Museum of Art and History board, the Latino Affairs Commission, and Rise Together through the Community Foundation Santa Cruz County &#8212; Hernandez has been at the forefront of relationship building, making her role all the more all-encompassing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Community archivists are very unique roles, not just on our campus but in general &#8212;&#160;they are a fairly new phenomenon,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Essentially our role is to interrogate and contemplate what archives are meant to be, why they were started, and determine how we can do a better job of collecting materials that reflect the community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz is a rich environment for that role, Hernandez explained. The land was &#8220;discovered&#8221; by Spanish explorer Don Gaspar de Portola in 1769, who named the San Lorenzo river in honor of Saint Lawrence and the rolling hills above the river Santa Cruz, to reflect the &#8220;holy cross.&#8221; Over the next 100 years, Santa Cruz garnered a mission, the Spanish pueblo of Villa de Branciforte, and became one of the 27 original counties in the state after California was granted statehood in 1850. Santa Cruz was incorporated first as a town in 1866, and received its first charter as a city in 1876.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that neatly packaged history is only part of the Santa Cruz we know today, said Hernandez. In starting her role as the community archivist, she has gone out countywide to discuss what the archive could look like with members of the community, ranging from organization leaders like the Watsonville Film Festival and Senderos to UC Santa Cruz professors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In some cases, the conversations were very personal. We talked about all the things that can make it challenging to bridge the relationship between the university and the community, and vice versa,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That opened a lot of doors for us to go out and meet more people&#8230;it was really beautiful and gave us a chance to determine next steps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Community Archive focuses on three components in its work:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To share resources with the community</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To serve as a catalyst for community wide dialogue about the history of the county</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To develop meaningful experiential learning opportunities for students&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez has been the Chairman for the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band since 2003, and has been good friends with Hernandez and a collaborator with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Indian Resource Center</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2009. Hernandez said that her first priority was to start with acknowledging indigenous peoples from the start, seeing as how &#8220;we benefit from being on their land, and working in their city.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez said that the original indigenous peoples of Santa Cruz, similar to many parts of the U.S., have been &#8220;ignored, forgotten and erased from history,&#8221; making this land acknowledgement all the more important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are approximately eight identified tribes in the greater Santa Cruz area that spoke the Awaswas language, and there are no known survivors of the descendants of the Awaswas speakers,&#8221; Lopez said, noting that the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band are representing the Awaswas speaking tribes. &#8220;That has a great impact on our tribe&#8230;it&#8217;s our responsibility to restore these lands and work to ensure we&#8217;re never forgotten.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Community Archiving Program has also attained its first acquisition separate from this event, recently receiving materials from the Japanese American Citizens League. These two acquisitions will be just the start of what&#8217;s to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The history of the community evolves as we evolve, and we are witnesses of change,&#8221; Hernandez said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about 50 years from now, 100 years from now, 200 years from now &#8212;&#160;what do we want people to know about us? The Community Archiving Program is meant to preserve those moments in time.&#8221;</span></p>

A first-generation student, Ornelas&#8217;s passions include giving back to her community, student activism, and labor and education policy.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>She was awarded the Valerie Fuette Scholarship in Politics in 2022 and is working toward combating the rising cost of a college education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Valerie Fuette Scholarship in Politics, a permanently endowed award donated by Fuette (Cowell &#8216;85, politics), looks to help students alleviate debt amidst the growth of higher education costs. The issue of higher education&#8217;s rising costs is now more important than ever: a challenge observed and combated by Ornelas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating in Spring 2024, Ornelas plans to attend law school and practice family and labor law to give back to her community. At UCSC, Ornelas focuses on labor and education policy in preparation for this career path. Ornelas&#8217; passion for these issues is what drove her to attend UCSC, a university booming with student activism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to go somewhere where students were equally passionate about social issues,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I fell in love with the campus forest environment, which was calming after midterms and finals. As a first-generation and low-income student, UCSC had a lot to offer through EOP and HSI initiatives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ornelas says the Valerie Fuette Scholarship will lighten the financial burden she faces as a student working multiple jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ornelas currently works as a paralegal assistant with Medina Paralegal Services, is a community engagement intern with local nonprofit Senderos, and is an intern with nonprofit organization, Women In Leadership for Diverse Representation. In addition to her internships, Ornelas is an RA for Cowell College and is a Peer Advisor with the Politics and Legal Studies department.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ornelas values the ability to destress and have conversations with housemates and friends, where they give advice and possible solutions to challenges they face.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We would also spend long nights discussing our views on societal issues,&#8221; Ornelas says. &#8220;This is an experience of community and intellect that I would not be able to experience at just any University.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ornelas moves towards changes at a level of law and policy, she hasn&#8217;t lost focus on the change she can make even now. Ornelas offers guidance for the students to follow in her footsteps and take advantage of the many resources UCSC has to offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No one will know when you need help until you ask,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Make it your job to learn about the resources that UCSC has to offer. Apply to every opportunity you are interested in because you never know when a door opens.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="535fbe6b807270467dc0c983f45f29d9"><name>guthman-distinguished-career-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Food system researcher Julie Guthman wins distinguished career award </title><summary>Professor of sociology and community studies Julie Guthman was recognized with the Distinguished Career Award by the Cultural and Political Ecology speciality group of the American Association of Geographers. </summary><start-date>1680678000000</start-date><path>/2023/04/guthman-distinguished-career-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/guthman-distinguished-career-award</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1680730996312</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1680730996312</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Community Studies</value><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/guthman-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/guthman-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-250.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>60316</file-size><width>250</width><height>264</height></image><image-alt>portrait of Julie Guthman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/10/images/guthman-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/10/images/guthman-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>guthman-80.jpg</name><display-name>guthman-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>21257</file-size><width>80</width><height>85</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Julie Guthman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor Julie Guthman</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor of sociology and community studies Julie Guthman was recently recognized with the Distinguished Career Award by the Cultural and Political Ecology speciality group of the American Association of Geographers (AAG).&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nomination letter, signed by several dozen top scholars, stated that Guthman&#8217;s work &#8220;profoundly influenced the way we understand how capitalism has reshaped U.S. and global food systems and the conditions of possibility for their transformation.&#8221; In particular, the award credits Guthman for her groundbreaking books that have challenged popular narratives around both industrial and alternative food systems.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guthman&#8217;s 2004 book, </span><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520277465/agrarian-dreams"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in California</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, critiqued the politics of organic food labeling and the sector&#8217;s land ownership structures and labor models. Her second book </span><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520266254/weighing-in"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice, and the Limits of Capitalism</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, challenged narratives about food as both cause and cure in the obesity epidemic. And her most recent book, </span><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520305281/wilted"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilted: Pathogens, Chemicals, and the Fragile Future of the Strawberry Industry</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shed new light on the strawberry industry&#8217;s dependence on toxic soil fumigants.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award nomination letter said these and other publications by Guthman &#8220;have become standard reading in both critical agrarian studies and food studies,&#8221; while also having &#8220;crossover appeal to scholar activists and other non-academic readers.&#8221; Guthman has continued her insightful analyses of efforts to transform food, with her </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/10/food-systems-novel-protein.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">research&#160; focused on&#160; the tech industry&#8217;s ambitions to make food production more sustainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guthman said she was honored to receive the Distinguished Career Award from the AAG Cultural and Political Ecology group and is grateful to all those who nominated her.&#160;</span></p>

The second will be led by Max Haeussler, Associate Research Scientist at the UCSC Genomics Institute. <br/><br/><strong>Examining platelets and aging</strong> <br/><br/>Forsberg and Manso&#8217;s project will study the connection between aging and platelet production among the human population. Platelets are small blood cells whose primary function is to form clots to prevent bleeding. The researchers will address gaps in the scientific understanding of how changes to age-related platelet production can lead to blood clots, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. This research could lead to improved treatment strategies for the millions of Americans who take drugs to prevent these health risks. <br/><br/>The project, titled &#8220;Determining how age-specific heterogeneity of human hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitors contribute to thrombotic disease upon aging,&#8221; was awarded $1,536,000 in funding.<br/><br/>&#8220;We are thrilled to receive funding from CIRM to explore how aging changes platelet production among the human population,&#8221; Manso said. &#8220;Age-related changes to platelets contribute to and drive a myriad of diseases, resulting in morbidity and mortality of the elderly. Over the next several years, we will leverage studies at the cellular and molecular level to reveal why this happens and explore potential routes of clinical intervention."<br/><br/>&#8220;The research translates animal model discoveries from my lab into research critical for human health,&#8221; Forsberg said. &#8220;From a training perspective, it is very satisfying that the grant proposal was pioneered by Bryce Manso, who is funded by a National Institutes of Health <a href="https://ibsc.ucsc.edu/iracda-training-program/">IRACDA training grant</a> to our IBSC. This success story shows how world-class training programs attract exceptional talent to UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;<br/><br/>Additional contributors to this proposal include Saran Chattopadhyaya and Stephanie Smith-Berdan of the Forsberg lab, Professor of Biomolecular Engineering and IBSC member Joshua Stuart, staff researcher in Stuart&#8217;s lab Chris Wong, and Stanford University collaborators Charles Kwok Fai Chan and Ravindra Majeti.<br/><br/><strong>&#8216;Virtual microscope&#8217; for single cell RNA-sequencing data</strong><br/><br/>For Haeussler&#8217;s project, he and his team will build a user-friendly database that brings together a wide range of single cell RNA-sequencing data, which reveals information about the gene expression levels of an individual cell, from the developing and diseased human cerebral cortex. The database is imagined as a &#8220;virtual microscope&#8221; which will improve the curation and visualization of this data and allow scientists to investigate the role of a specific gene in the development of the cerebral cortex without special computational training.<br/><br/>The database will support spatial transcriptomics data, an emerging technique for determining the relative location of a given cell within the tissue. Users will be able to compare single cell RNA-sequencing data with spatial transcriptomic information to those without spatial transcriptomic information, increasing the ability to compare previously produced data to newer data. <br/><br/>The database will be hosted on the Genomics Institute&#8217;s existing <a href="https://cells.ucsc.edu/">cell browser platform</a>, a free, open-source tool used by researchers and pharmaceutical companies around the world. <br/><br/>Two Genomics Institute staff members will collect existing data on gene activity in the human brain from researchers across the world and make it accessible in the interactive map viewer that Haeussler has been developing for the last five years. Aparna Bhaduri, Haeussler&#8217;s collaborator at UCLA for this grant, will produce new spatial data to add to this collection.<br/><br/>"After years of searching, I'm excited to get funding for this software project,&#8221; Haeussler said. &#8220;Already several thousand researchers every week are consulting this interactive explorer of gene activity. The CIRM funding allows us to add several hundred datasets in the human brain, it will be the first brain-focussed gene activity explorer that hosts datasets from different labs across the world and as such from a broad diversity of patients" <br/><br/>This project is titled &#8220;An interactive data resource for hypothesis testing in stem cell single-cell gene expression and validation of the results with brain organoids,&#8221; and was awarded $1,160,126 in funding. <br/><br/>These awards are among the seventeen new projects throughout the state for which <a href="https://www.cirm.ca.gov/about-cirm/newsroom/press-releases/03272023/cirm-welcomes-new-board-chair-invests-26-million">CIRM is investing</a> $26 million in total funding. They are part of CIRM&#8217;s DISC-0: Foundation Awards Program, which supports rigorous studies addressing critical basic knowledge gaps in the biology of stem cells and regenerative medicine approaches and to advance stem cell-based tools.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6dab44f280727046263f66fc1925858c"><name>fireworks-prohibited</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Fireworks not allowed on campus, pose significant fire risk</title><summary>On Saturday evening, an unknown person set off a firework in a grassy area near the West Remote Parking Lot.</summary><start-date>1681110000000</start-date><display-name>Fireworks not allowed on campus, pose significant fire risk</display-name><path>/2023/04/fireworks-prohibited</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/fireworks-prohibited</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1681172153568</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1681172153568</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>On Saturday evening, an unknown person set off a firework in a grassy area near the West Remote Parking Lot.

<p>This task force, composed of senate and administration and graduate student members and co-chaired by Dard Neuman, Don Smith, with sub-committee co-chairs Lissa Caldwell, and Garrett Naiman, over the past year took on the important task of developing plans and recommendations to implement the recommendations of the Joint Working Group for Graduate Education. This included working with Graduate Division, academic divisions, and Budget Analysis and Planning staff to compile and analyze data related to graduate support, student well-being, and academic success. The ITF Steering Committee was instrumental in providing input and guidance to the ITF.</p>
<p>The ITF report and recommendations look at the entirety of graduate education and graduate student support and well-being, including recommendations and significant resources that fall across multiple units, including the departments, PIs, the Graduate Division, academic divisions, and the central administration.</p>
<p>The Graduate Division is committed to supporting the ITF recommendations on several levels, including (1) coordinating the annual updating process for the Graduate Student Support Model and Planning Tool, (2) developing a Graduate Division funding model for Student Success and Inclusive Excellence, and (3) promoting student well-being and success via enhanced mentoring and professional development.</p>
<p>We are committed to enhancing the success of our graduate students and we will be working over the coming months to engage the broader campus community with implementation plans to achieve these important goals.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Don Smith and Dard Neuman and all the other task force members for their hard work and dedication to graduate education.</p>

<p><a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=nocampop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalia Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, assistant professor of Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz, is the senior scientist on the team that was led by ornithologist and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign PhD student Juliana Soto-Pati&#241;o. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other team members are: Estefan&#237;a Guzm&#225;n, Daniela Garz&#243;n, Katherine Certuche (all local ornithologists of Tolima), Nelsy Ni&#241;o the community-engagement leader of the BIO expedition project, and Jessica Ni&#241;o and Natalia P&#233;rez, both young ornithologists of the BIO expeditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since first finding her contributions in September 2020, the group has written about Kerr&#8217;s work and history, in the context of underrepresentation of women in the science prevalent in historical understandings of naturalism, and published by </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/condor"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ornithological Applications</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later this spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela and Soto-Pati&#241;o began their work with this team while working full-time at </span><a href="http://www.humboldt.org.co/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute (IAHV)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Bogota, leading a project called the BIO Expeditions. It was during those expeditions that their team examined locations across the country that had been surveyed by the American Museum of Natural History between 1911 and 1915, and led to their collective discovery of Kerr&#8217;s work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1900s, Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela said, ornithologist Frank Chapman &#8212; one of the most renowned American ornithologists &#8212; led a team of white, all-male naturalists throughout Colombia, visiting 74 sites throughout the country and collecting approximately 16,000 bird specimens. The group then took that work back to New York, to study the distribution of birds across South America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we were doing was to examine how the bird communities had changed over the last 100 years,&#8221; Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela explained. &#8220;We wanted to revisit some of these places, and do the contemporary bird collections ourselves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparing for those initial expeditions to the Tolima localities, in September 2020 the team read through historical texts, mostly from the 1917 book &#8220;The Distribution of Birds in Colombia,&#8221; by Frank Chapman. It was during that research where the team stumbled upon the &#8220;Mrs. Kerr Collection,&#8221; ultimately leading to their discovery of the forgotten female collector and naturalist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had all trained as ornithologists, and never in the early history of Colombian ornithology had we seen a female name,&#8221; shared Soto-Pati&#241;o.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team directed their efforts to learn more about Kerr, and immediately contacted the Ornithology collection at the American Museum of Natural History to see if they had more information on Kerr&#8217;s work. The Museum was &#8220;incredibly helpful,&#8221; said Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela, providing the team with specimen lists and pictures that Kerr had collected in the early 1900s. Ultimately, the connection that led to a great deal of intrigue and excitement for the group was the discovery of letters between Kerr and Frank Chapman, housed in the Ornithology collection archive at the AMNH which were shared with the team.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through those letters, the team was able to find that Kerr was not an official employee, but would sell bird specimens to the museum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research and expeditions during this time &#8212; while COVID-19 was still highly prevalent around the world &#8212; were difficult to manage and plan for. Soto-Pati&#241;o, expedition leader and lead author on the paper, said the teams would follow strict protocols as PCR before quarantining prior to each expedition, and everyone wore masks while hiking throughout the areas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding Kerr was &#8220;surprising,&#8221; to say the least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For any research area in science, many times we know a little bit about the early history and the people who have developed the main research in the field,&#8221; Soto-Pati&#241;o said. &#8220;For Colombian ornithology, in the 1970s or 1980s, you start to see women in this history &#8212; but prior to that, you never had.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team, as both Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela and Soto-Pati&#241;o explained, are incredibly excited for their findings to be published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ornithological Applications</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the two largest ornithology journals in the United States. The piece will be published in both English and Spanish, to ensure accessibility for Latin American people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s made all the more impressive when considering that their findings were the result of a side project, not their initial expedition goals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were very dedicated because, as women, Kerr was a role model that we had been longing for but never had,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela said. &#8220;Elizabeth is still someone foreign to Colombia, but we shared part of her identity&#8230;we had this one connection with her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Said Soto-Pati&#241;o, &#8220;it&#8217;s important for the next generations to have these references in history&#8230;Elizabeth was a great finding for ornithology as a whole, but also for women and science in general.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together with the Kerr findings, the authors include in the paper the description of an all-female expedition they carried out in one of the localities where Kerr collected birds, to honor her legacy and exalt the roles and contributions of women in science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team of researchers has spread out since their original expedition &#8212; Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela in Santa Cruz, Soto-Pati&#241;o in Urbana-Champaign, and the rest of the team in different regions in Colombia &#8212; but the experience has kept them together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a chance for us to understand more about the history we have lost, and examine how we can right these wrongs when addressing women&#8217;s findings into the future,&#8221; Ocampo-Pe&#241;uela said. &#8220;Women are capable of doing expeditions, and we want to show girls that are watching they can do this work too.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="71c0b46480727046310b56ceffbe41be"><name>louie-campos</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A lifetime of service</title><summary>Louie Campos graduated from College Seven—now Oakes College—with a cohort of seven other students.

Campos and others&#8212;part of a student working group&#8212;worked with Co-Founding Provost Professor J. Herman Blake to give input on the architectural design and purpose of Oakes College, and helped create a long-lasting legacy at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The purpose of Oakes was what attracted me to the college,&#8221; Campos said. &#8220;Oakes is committed to intellectual, academic, and personal inquiry rooted in the possibility of affecting positive social and political change. That still holds true with me.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, 83-year-old Campos lives in West Sacramento with his wife of 53 years, Glennda. His career spans many roles serving the community, including jobs in the health field. These roots go back to UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>The journey to UCSC</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between high school and when he entered UCSC, Campos had a wide range of experiences. Throughout the summers while he attended high school, Campos was a farm worker, and after he graduated, he served in the army for three years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campos was stationed in Germany with a Military Occupational Specialty as a Field Medic and Pharmacy Technician. When he returned to Visalia, he worked in the fields, as a waiter, and as an orderly at the local hospital.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he first visited the UCSC campus, Campos was taken aback by its beauty and was reminded of his days serving in the army.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It reminded me of Germany since I was stationed near a dark, green, and wonderful forest (think of the Black Forest),&#8221; he says. &#8220;The campus, the people, the seeds of innovation and intellectual discovery were all there.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Campos started at UCSC, Professor J. Herman Blake, Co-Founding Provost of Oakes College*, had a major influence on him. Campos said that Blake was the driver and visionary leader of what a progressive college should look like. So when a student committee was formed to help design Oakes College, Campos became a member and collaborated with Blake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blake said Campos played an essential role on the team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Campos was an exemplar of the expressed philosophy and goals of College Seven (Oakes College),&#8221; Blake said. &#8220;He embodied, he exuded, the values and principles that guided us. His model was a positive influence on his fellow students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time at UCSC, Campos ran for student body president. His slogan was &#8220;You </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trust someone over 30,&#8221; and he won the election.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In 1964, Jack Weinberg coined the phrase &#8216;Never Trust Anyone Over 30,&#8217;&#8221; Campos says. &#8220;I was saying to students that they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a way, I was trying to be humorous.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campos said he had a good relationship with UCSC founding chancellor Dean McHenry and often pressed him on student issues.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A Lifetime of Service</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His military background in health care delivery, combined with his wife&#8217;s experience as an OBGYN- Nurse Practitioner, motivated Campos to continue in this field of study. He earned a Masters in Public Health from UC Berkeley, then became a director of community and migrant health programs in Colorado and California. In this role, Campos helped create a community and migrant health care center in Colorado.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campos was also a public health care administrator, working at and managing AIDS education and prevention programs for 16 years until he retired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another career highlight was working as a county director for Kings County (Hanford) for Self-Help Enterprises, where he helped farmworkers build their own homes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whether working in the health field or farmworker housing, my Community Studies degree from UCSC was important, especially in the politics of community development,&#8221; he says.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campos also served on many community boards and committees, including one appointed by Governor Jerry Brown, who appointed him as a layperson on the State Board of Optometry. Outside of his career, Campos connected with communities and organizations around and outside of California.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He has constantly expanded his impact on society,&#8221; said UCSC Professor J. Herman Blake. &#8220;From a student to a community leader, from a student to a parent and grandparent. He touches generations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And about 13 years ago Campos spent 1.5 years collecting stories and photos of world-class athletes who were specifically from the Bryte and Broderick neighborhood in West Sacramento. The exhibit of photos and posters with narratives is still on display at the recreation center.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Something that I&#8217;m also proud of is organizing a no-contact boxing program for kids,&#8221; Campos said. &#8220;The coaches, who were many of the athletes that were part of the photo exhibit, were world boxing champions and baseball players. The best and most talented boxer was a little 10-year-old girl. She could box your ears off.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program ran for three years and over 150 kids participated.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Parting Words</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if he has any advice for UCSC students and alumni, Campos replied: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Greatest Joy of a Raindrop is When it Enters the River.</span></i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Africa&#8217;s iconic grasslands are dominated by plants known as &#8220;C4 grasses,&#8221; which use a photosynthetic pathway adapted for warm, arid conditions. The emergence of these ecosystems is important for understanding the evolution of early apes and other mammals.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new study puts C4 grasses on the landscape more than 10 million years before these grasses came to dominate the landscapes where we see them today,&#8221; said Pratigya Polissar, associate professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz and a coauthor of the study, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq2834">published April 13 in <em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>Researchers have often argued that during the early Miocene, between about 15 and 20 million years ago, equatorial Africa was covered by a semi-continuous forest and that open habitats with C4 grasses didn't proliferate until about 8 to 10 million years ago. Yet there was some research indicating that C4 grasses were present in East Africa as early as 15 million years ago.</p>
<p>The new study sought to determine if this was an anomaly or a clue to the true diversity of ecosystems that occurred during the early Miocene. The findings would have important implications for understanding the features and adaptations of early apes and why there are tropical C4 grasslands and savanna ecosystems in Africa and around the world.</p>
<p>First author Daniel Peppe at Baylor University and an interdisciplinary team of scientists conducted research at nine Early Miocene fossil site complexes in the East African Rift of Kenya and Uganda as part of the Research on Eastern African Catarrhine and Hominoid Evolution (REACHE) project. The team focused on understanding the types of ecosystems that existed in the early Miocene, the prevalence of open environments and C4 grasses, and how these different environments could have potentially affected the evolution of early apes.</p>
<p>Polissar conducted isotopic analysis of fossil soils, focusing on molecular biomarkers from the plants that lived on those soils. &#8220;Our carbon isotope analysis of those soils provides unambiguous evidence for grasses with the C4 pathway living in these ancient environments,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a huge project and there were many other analyses that contributed to the overall findings as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As participants exchanged information and expertise about geological features, isotopes, and plant and ape fossils found at the sites, the bigger picture came into focus. The paradigm that during the early Miocene period equatorial Africa was completely forested was wrong.</p>
<p>Further, the result of this decade-long research pushes back the oldest evidence of habitats dominated by C4 grasses&#8212;in Africa and globally&#8212;by more than 10 million years, calling for revised paleoecological interpretations of mammalian evolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suspected that we would find C4 plants at some sites, but we didn't expect to find them at as many sites as we did, and in such high abundance,&#8221; Peppe said. &#8220;Multiple lines of evidence show that C4 grasses and open habitats were important parts of the early Miocene landscape and that early apes lived in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from closed canopy forests to open habitats like scrublands and wooded grasslands with C4 grasses. It really changes our understanding of what ecosystems looked like when the modern African plant and animal community was evolving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research flourished through the uniqueness of the REACHE project, according to coauthor Kieran McNulty at the University of Minnesota, who played a central role in organizing the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working in the fossil record is challenging. We discover hints and clues about past life and need to figure out how to assemble and interpret them across space and time. Any one of the analyses in these papers would have made for an interesting study, and any one of them, alone, would have produced incomplete, inconclusive, or incorrect interpretations,&#8221; McNulty said. &#8220;That is the nature of paleontological research: it&#8217;s like putting together a 4D puzzle, but where each team member can only see some of the pieces. By combining these methods, we leverage the strength of one to shore up weaknesses or validate assumptions of another, resulting in a synthetic approach that challenges well-established theories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team combined many different lines of evidence&#8212;from geology, fossil soils, isotopes, and phytoliths (plant silica microfossils)&#8212;to reach their conclusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The history of grassland ecosystems in Africa prior to 10 million years had remained a mystery, in part because there were so few plant fossils, so it was exciting when it became clear that we had phytolith assemblages to add to the other lines of evidence,&#8221; said coauthor Caroline Str&#246;mberg at the University of Washington. &#8220;What we found was thrilling, and very different from what was the accepted story. We used to think tropical, C4-dominated grasslands only appeared in the last 8 million years or so, depending on the continent. Instead, both phytolith data and isotopic data showed that C4-dominated grassy environments appeared over 10 million years earlier, in the early Miocene in eastern Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>This much earlier occurrence of C4 grasses and open habitats found at the same sites as early apes also allowed the researchers to assess the kinds of environments in which the early apes were living. One of the most advanced early apes, <em>Morotopithecus</em>, was found to inhabit open woodland environments with abundant grasses and to rely on leaves as an important component of its diet. This contradicts long-standing predictions that the unique features of apes, such as an upright torso, originated in forested environments to enable access to fruit resources. These findings are transformative, said Robin Bernstein, program director for biological anthropology at the U.S. National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time, by combining diverse lines of evidence, this collaborative research team tied specific aspects of early ape anatomy to nuanced environmental changes in their habitat in eastern Africa, now revealed as more open and less forested than previously thought. The effort outlines a new framework for future studies regarding ape evolutionary origins,&#8221; Bernstein said.</p>

<p>Contreras plans to continue doing research in particle physics while pursuing a Ph.D. in physics, with the goal of becoming a professor at a research-focused university. She also wants to help underrepresented students by offering mentorship and creating small projects to give students research experience. Contreras herself is a first-generation student from a low-income household, and she has mentored six freshman first-generation students under UCSC&#8217;s <a href="https://eop.ucsc.edu/eop_services/bridge/index.html">Bridge Program</a>. She also helped organize &#8220;No-Jargon Talks,&#8221; presentations aimed to make STEM research more accessible to undergraduate students and members of the Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program was established by Congress in 1986 to honor Senator Barry Goldwater.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raised by her mother&#8212;a Mexican immigrant&#8212;and her father&#8212;a Vietnamese refugee&#8212; Kim Bernice Nguyen has often advocated for herself and her family.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The youngest person to ever be elected to the Garden Grove City Council at 25 years old and the first person of Latin descent, Nguyen has had to stand her ground and be a champion for young women of color. Nguyen is running for the California 45th district congressional seat in 2024.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Until we start to see people like us in seats of power, we can&#8217;t imagine ourselves there,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;We have to continue to be the change we want to see, whatever that looks like. We must make sure that we encourage people and lift them with us as we go forward in this journey to create a bench that doesn&#8217;t currently exist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the opportunity arose to run for Congress, Nguyen knew she could be the voice for young people, women, and people of color in her district, which has a demographic of 37 percent Asian and 23 percent Latinx.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen aspired to pursue a political career, even as a little girl. Helping her parents navigate the U.S.&#8212;standing in as a translator, explaining systems like food stamps, and making decisions&#8212;forced her to reckon with political and social structures at a young age.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first grade she decided she wanted to run for President of the United States and walked around with a paper that said &#8220;Vote Kim Nguyen, When? Now.&#8221; At the bottom of the paper she wrote &#8220;2028 or 2032.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had done the math that I would be 36 and eligible to run for POTUS in 2028, and if I didn&#8217;t win the first time I&#8217;d run again in 2032</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This idea/dream came from seeing men in suits in front of podiums giving speeches on TV about new laws and issues facing my family, my community, and myself, but I realized they didn&#8217;t look like me, my family or my community. So the idea that I needed to be that person started to grow in my mind.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nguyen announced her run for Congress in Jan. 2023 and is working with peers, friends, and community members to jumpstart her grassroots campaign&#8212;similar to how she won her city council seat in 2016.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Attending UC Santa Cruz&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first-generation high school and college graduate, Nguyen overcame many obstacles while pursuing a degree from UC Santa Cruz. Navigating financial aid and working multiple jobs to afford tuition, Nguyen did everything she could to support herself.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She graduated with a B.A. in politics and legal studies in 2013 and said she is grateful for the opportunities to get exposed to local politics in Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was fortunate enough to have Professor Coonerty for one of my law classes,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;I knew he was a city council member, so I took every class he offered. At one point, he offered extra credit for us to attend a council meeting, which was my first taste of local government.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For current students at UCSC hoping to pursue a career in law and policy, Nguyen offered some advice:&#160;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Find what you&#8217;re passionate about.</span></i></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re either going to volunteer for an organization that does work around what you care about, or you&#8217;re going to find a campaign to jump on, and you want to believe in that candidate and what they&#8217;re standing for,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have to know yourself and where you stand on issues. What do you believe in? What do you care about?&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Know what direction you want to go in, and if you&#8217;re unsure, try everything.</span></i></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being a leader trying to effectuate change doesn&#8217;t always mean you have to be an elected official,&#8221; Nguyen said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a desperate need for chiefs of staff, district directors, political directors, campaign staff, and fundraising people. There are so many political opportunities besides being elected officials.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always keep other people in mind.</span></i></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When an opportunity, a job, an internship or fellowship comes your way, and you know you don&#8217;t qualify or it&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re looking for, think about someone in your life that you think would be great at it, and send it to them.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="76d75d6a807270463f529e05a4ec1e14"><name>lowe-trna-namer</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Naming system for transfer RNA fragments will increase research productivity, standardization</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Todd Lowe and his group created a new naming scheme for tRNA fragments aimed at standardizing research.</summary><start-date>1681326000000</start-date><path>/2023/04/lowe-trna-namer</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/lowe-trna-namer</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1681326038354</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1681326038354</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/todd_275vert.png</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/todd_275vert.png</link><site>news</site><name>todd_275vert.png</name><display-name>todd_275vert.png</display-name><file-size>183286</file-size><width>275</width><height>377</height></image><image-alt>Todd Lowe in his lab</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/todd_80.png</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/todd_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>todd_80.png</name><display-name>todd_80.png</display-name><file-size>17739</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Todd Lowe in his lab</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Todd Lowe&#160;and his group created a new naming scheme for tRNA fragments.&#160; (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p style="text-align: left;">Transfer RNA, more commonly referred to as tRNA, is well known for its key role in translating genetic material into protein. Recent discoveries about fragments of tRNA, which scientists had previously thought of as simply waste products in the cell ecosystem, has led to an increase in attention to these elements and the diverse functions they serve across all domains of life. These tRNA fragments, or tRNA-derived RNAs, are now an active area of interest for scientists studying topics such as Parkinson&#8217;s, cancer research, and more.&#160;<br/><br/>Until now the scientific community has not had a clear, standardized system for identifying and naming tRNA fragments. As a result, scientists across the world have been creating their own names for these functional molecules, making it difficult to compare and reproduce work in this field.&#160;<br/><br/>To address this issue, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Todd Lowe and his group created a new naming scheme for tRNA fragments aimed at standardizing this research. The inspiration and final standard grew from consensus and collaboration, co-led with Professor of Pediatrics and Genetics Mark Kay at Stanford, along with other leaders in tRNA research from around the world, all co-authors on the paper.&#160;<br/><br/>To promote adoption of the new naming system, the Lowe lab made a free, open source <a href="http://trna.ucsc.edu/tDRnamer/">web server</a> which enables researchers to simply paste in their tRNA fragment sequences to receive a consistent, biologically informative name with additional annotations and graphic displays. The server also allows researchers to input a sequence name and receive the exact sequence of bases to which it belongs. A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01813-2">correspondence paper</a> in the journal <em>Nature Methods</em> details these contributions.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Hopefully now the field will be required to name tRNA fragments in a uniform way, and compare results,&#8221; Lowe said. &#8220;Right now, there's almost no requirement for reproducibility in this field &#8211; it's awful.&#8221;<br/><br/>Postdoctoral Scholar Andrew Holmes and Project Scientist Patricia Chan, both in Lowe&#8217;s group, were lead authors on the paper and key in creating the new web server.</p>
<p>&#8232;As a graduate student, Lowe wrote a software tool &#8212; <a href="http://trna.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/">tRNAscan-SE</a> &#8212; to improve upon the existing methods for identifying tRNA genes in DNA sequences. This tool is still the main method used by scientists to identify and annotate tRNA genes, and it continues to be maintained and improved upon by Lowe&#8217;s group. This history, and their expertise in both RNA biology &#8212; specifically tRNAs &#8212; and computational work, makes Lowe&#8217;s group a natural fit for addressing the issue of naming tRNA fragments.</p>

<p>Research on tRNA fragments is a relatively new field, as they started gaining recognition and interest only about a decade ago. These fragments are widely varied and perform a myriad of roles in the cell ecosystem, many of which are still being discovered and explored. For example, some tRNA fragments have been recognized to promote cell growth by enabling assembly of ribosomes, the protein factories, whereas other fragments can gum up that same machinery, halting protein production. Other fragments bind key proteins that&#160; can enhance or prevent programmed cell death, and still others get exported in extracellular microvesicles that can communicate information across cells. Together, this mix of many hundreds of types of tRNA fragments add another layer of fine-tuning control to cells, and show promise as a new class of biomarkers for early detection of disease.<br/><br/>The particularities of the chemical bonds in tRNAs had made these molecules difficult to sequence. New sequencing methods have been developed to address these challenges, which has also led to an acceleration of research in this field.&#160;<br/>&#8232;The current lack of a naming system for tRNA fragments makes it very difficult for researchers to compare their discoveries. It also makes it nearly impossible to determine which tRNA the fragment originates from. In humans alone, there are more than 500 different tRNA genes, and understanding which one or more the fragment is derived from is crucial for understanding the role that the fragments play.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;When someone publishes something, you often don't know what its significance is in the context of everything else that&#8217;s been done in the field of tRNA fragments,&#8221; Lowe said. &#8220;That&#8217;s unheard of &#8212; it&#8217;s frustrating, and it&#8217;s not a robust way to do science.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>The new naming scheme makes it easy to locate where in a genome the tRNA fragment comes from and if it is derived from multiple tRNAs or just one. It also identifies if there is variance between the sequenced fragment and the reference tRNA.&#160;<br/><br/>Lowe hopes that journal editors will require this new naming system in order to accelerate the process of comparing and integrating findings across the wide range of research that involves tRNA fragments.&#160;<br/><br/>Lowe believes some researchers may be hesitant to stop using the original names they&#8217;ve assigned to tRNA fragments discovered in their labs, but suggests researchers can use their chosen identifiers in papers as long as they give reference to the systematic name as well. The many collaborating co-authors on the paper who helped shape the standard will be important in getting the word out about this new system and encouraging other scientists to adopt it.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We were thrilled to work with a group of scientists who had a vested interest in putting away individual preferences for the good of the field and produced a naming scheme that will make it easier to advance this growing field,&#8221; Kay said.&#160;<br/><br/>In the future, Lowe and his group intend to merge the naming software with another of their programs, which maps misincorporation-inferred modifications in tRNA sequencing reads. They will also apply the new naming system to publicly available data sets, and incorporate these into the <a href="http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/">Genomic tRNA Database</a> (GtRNAdb), which is maintained by Lowe&#8217;s group.&#160;<br/><br/>Lowe is excited to see what discoveries will be enabled by the adaption of this naming system.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;There&#8217;s a ton more of these tRNA fragments,&#8221; Lowe said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve just seen the tip of the iceberg, which is why this is so important.&#8221;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7bcaf146807270467032682aeb919ad6"><name>fruition-brewing</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Coming to Fruition</title><summary>UCSC alumni Tallula Preston and David Purgason founded Watsonville based Fruition Brewing in 2019.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For UC Santa Cruz alumni Tallula Preston and David Purgason, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fruition</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;the attainment of something desired, a realization, or accomplishment&#8212;was the perfect name for their brewery founded in 2019. Now four years later, the duo&#8217;s establishment is a staple in the Santa Cruz and Watsonville craft beer scene.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruition Brewing&#8217;s sours were named Best of Santa Cruz by the Good Times in 2021, and the brewery won NEXTies&#8217; new business of the year in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve doubled our production since we opened, and it&#8217;s hard to believe that we&#8217;re about to turn four,&#8221; David said. &#8220;I feel super fortunate. We have a fantastic team along this ride with us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo often uses their space to host community events, most recently encouraging folks to come out to Fruition Brewing on April 2 and donated a portion of their sales to help raise funds for Pajaro Valley flood victims. In partnership with Pajaro Valley Pride the community raised just over $15,000. In February, Tallula and David hosted a UCSC alumni gathering.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was awesome seeing different generations of UCSC alumni ranging from the 80s to the 2000s and seeing them all enjoying beer and some snacks and connecting,&#8221; Tallula said.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fruitful beginnings&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tallula graduated from UCSC with a combined degree in environmental studies and biology in 2010, and David graduated in 2012 with a degree in environmental studies. David wrote his senior thesis on &#8220;The Sustainability of Craft Beer in California&#8221; and knew he would pursue a career in the craft beer industry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Tallula and David say their background in environmental studies, and sustainability inform their decisions and practices at Fruition Brewing. The brewery is a carbon-neutral business and utilizes organic grain. They also partner with local farmers who use organic and sustainable practices.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are always choices that have to be made, and we&#8217;re doing our best to make sustainable ones every step of the way,&#8221; Tallula said. &#8220;But we also want to ensure we succeed, make good beer, and have a place that can last. So we are doing what we can to balance that line.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo met at Seven Bridges Organic Brewing Supply, a now-closed certified organic establishment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understanding where my food comes from was always important to me,&#8221; Tallula said. &#8220;Being at UCSC just dialed it all in. I got involved with many environmental organizations and couldn&#8217;t imagine doing anything else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruition Brewing can be found selling cans of their craft beer at farmers&#8217; markets around Santa Cruz County.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We both cared deeply about supporting our local farms, and we&#8217;re super blessed to be surrounded by an area with a ton of awesome producers who care about organic and sustainable practices,&#8221; David said. &#8220;We have had a stand in the farmers market for years, and it&#8217;s only furthered our relationship directly with growers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After meeting at Seven Bridges, Tallula and David began forming their business plan and looking for an ideal place in the county in 2016. In 2019, they opened Fruition Brewing at 918 East Lake Ave in Watsonville.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Brewing through the pandemic</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight months after the grand opening of Fruition Brewing, the COVID-19 pandemic forced shops worldwide to shut down and change their operations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruition Brewing, a newly opened establishment that had not planned on selling canned beer, quickly pivoted its plans to sustain itself.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most people didn&#8217;t even know that we had opened yet,&#8221; Tallula said. &#8220;We were forced to pivot immediately, and within 24 hours, we had our online store up and we were selling crowlers through our website for both home delivery and contactless pickup. We did deliveries every day, seven days a week, for months.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 2021 they had opened the Fruition Kitchen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and began serving food, including fresh oysters, grilled cheese sandwiches, alongside seasonal soups, salads &amp; snacks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were also grateful to have ample outdoor patio space. In 2023, Fruition Brewing continues to look ahead to the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to know what it could have been like if the pandemic didn&#8217;t force us to grow,&#8221; Tallula said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve grown a lot, and we&#8217;re feeling good and proud of where we are.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7c9e0a95807270467032682a5b7b627f"><name>campus-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus Update: Celebrating Earth Day, thanks for Spring Give supporters, astrophysicist on ‘60 Minutes’</title><summary>Our campus has long championed environmental justice and sustainability, and continues to teach and train some of the nation's top environmental professionals and practitioners.</summary><start-date>1681369200000</start-date><display-name>Campus Update: Celebrating Earth Day, thanks for Spring Give supporters, astrophysicist on ‘60 Minutes’</display-name><path>/2023/04/campus-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/campus-update</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1681422944893</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1681422944893</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The UC Santa Cruz community will join with people and groups around the globe next week to commemorate Earth Day.

We will soon formally launch our Center for Coastal Climate Resilience. The center will engage partners across communities, agencies, and businesses to advance innovative nature-based solutions that build resilience to climate change. We are seeing first-hand the need for climate justice, and how climate change disproportionately impacts low-income and other historically marginalized communities. After one of the rainiest Central Coast winters in decades, the Pajaro River levee breached last month, flooding the unincorporated town of Pajaro, just across the river from Watsonville, and forcing residents of the primarily agricultural and immigrant community to flee their homes.</span></p>

<h2><span>Wide support for Spring Give</span></h2>
<p><span>Thank you to all who took part in our annual Spring Give. This week-plus crowdfunding effort, which wrapped up Tuesday, helps us give students across campus access to experiences and services that will help them succeed well past graduation. This &#8220;micro-giving&#8221; event allows donors to pinpoint exactly where their money is going, with dozens of campus organizations drumming up support from their backers. Including matching and challenge funds, this year&#8217;s effort raised a remarkable $107,144, with more than 755 donors taking part! I am grateful for all of our Slug supporters.</span></p>

<p><span>Congratulations to all of our researchers who have been deeply involved with the JWST project. Garth Illingworth, distinguished professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics, helped bring the telescope from concept to completion.

What an incredible and successful undertaking.</span></p>
<h2><span>India trip a chance to deepen collaborations</span></h2>
<p><span>Sometimes we can appreciate our university even more when we see it through the eyes of others. I had that special opportunity earlier this month when I traveled with a small group of university officials to India to meet with a host of other institutions to foster future institutional relationships, faculty collaborations, and possible student exchanges and summer research opportunities. We were very well received.</span></p>
<p><span>Among our stops: the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, the Indian Institute of Science and Jamia Millia Islamia. The trip allowed us to strengthen our existing relationship with IIT Kanpur, whose officials have visited our campus twice in recent years. We signed an MOU with the institute during the visit, and completed a similar agreement with Jamia Millia Islamia earlier this week. We also see opportunities to strengthen our partnership with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics.

<p><span>A veces podemos apreciar nuestra universidad a&#250;n m&#225;s cuando la vemos a trav&#233;s de ojos ajenos. Yo tuve esa oportunidad tan especial a principios de mes, cuando viaj&#233; con un peque&#241;o grupo de funcionarios de la universidad a la India a fin de reunirnos con otras instituciones para alentar futuras relaciones institucionales, colaboraciones de facultades, y posibles intercambios de estudiantes, as&#237; como oportunidades de investigaciones veraniegas. Fuimos muy bien recibidos.</span></p>

El viaje nos permiti&#243; fortalecer nuestras relaciones existentes con IIT Kanpur, cuyos oficiales han visitado nuestro campus dos veces en a&#241;os recientes. Firmamos un Memorando de Entendimiento (MOU, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) con dicho instituto durante la visita, y completamos un acuerdo similar con Jamia Millia Islamia a principios de esta semana.

London has been studying the importance of recess for more than 15 years and is the author of the book </span><a href="https://www.hepg.org/hep-home/books/rethinking-recess"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rethinking Recess: Creating Safe and Inclusive Playtime for All Children in School</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among her findings is that recess is often withheld from students as a form of punishment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My research indicates that this is a really common practice, especially in elementary schools, but it&#8217;s not an evidence-based practice,&#8221; London told legislators during her testimony. &#8220;There is no research showing that withholding recess improves student behavior. In fact, both the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics endorse banning the practice of withholding recess, because it is not aligned with the goals of positive child and youth development.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London explained that withholding recess is often counterproductive, because unstructured playtime actually &#8220;helps children to concentrate in the classroom, it supports their executive functioning, allowing them to make good decisions, improves their classroom behavior, and together all of that helps to improve academic performance.&#8221; She also shared that the connection students enjoy with peers and adults during recess even has the potential to provide &#8220;a buffering effect for students who have had adverse childhood experiences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London had been called before the committee to provide expert testimony in support of </span><a href="https://sd29.senate.ca.gov/news/press-release/new-legislation-would-guarantee-daily-recess-all-california-students-k-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 291</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would guarantee at least 30 minutes of recess per day for California students in kindergarten through eighth grade. Schools would have flexibility to distribute that time throughout the day, and the bill contains an exception for situations when a student&#8217;s participation in recess would pose an immediate safety threat.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Josh Newman, D-Fullerton, who authored the bill, told the committee that, in the wake of pandemic-era educational disruptions and increasing student mental health challenges, he believes &#8220;the benefits of unstructured play and peer-to-peer social interactions that are offered by recess are more important now than ever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newman said that, unlike some other states, California doesn&#8217;t currently set a standard for the quality or quantity of recess that schools should be providing each day. Instead, existing state law specifically authorizes teachers to withhold recess for disciplinary reasons.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As parents, it seems self-evident that recess is a good and necessary thing, so it is sometimes surprising to find out that it&#8217;s not provided,&#8221; Newman told the committee. &#8220;And the impacts are real. That&#8217;s the genesis of this bill.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 291 ultimately received enough votes to pass the education committee and will now be re-referred to the committee on appropriations. Prior to the vote, State Sen. Scott Wilk, R-Santa Clarita, expressed his enthusiastic support for the bill and shared his hopes for the impact it could have.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Three years ago, this body passed the &#8216;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/us/california-later-school-start-times.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">late start-time&#8217; bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and I think this bill can be as significant as that bill in terms of the quality of our students&#8217; lives,&#8221; Wilk said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="85e739ad807270466e91d87cf586735f"><name>water-quality</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Ensuring our water quality</title><summary>We take seriously the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff, and want to do all we can to ensure our water quality continues to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.

<p>The new findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf0566">published April 20 in <em>Science</em></a>, show that while elephant seals may spend 10 hours a day sleeping on the beach during the breeding season, they average just 2 hours of sleep per day when they are at sea on months-long foraging trips. They sleep for about 10 minutes at a time during deep, 30-minute dives, often spiraling downward while fast asleep, and sometimes lying motionless on the seafloor.</p>
<p>First author Jessica Kendall-Bar led the study as a UC Santa Cruz graduate student working with Daniel Costa and Terrie Williams, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years, one of the central questions about elephant seals has been when do they sleep,&#8221; said Costa, who directs UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences. Costa&#8217;s lab has led the UCSC elephant seal research program at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve for over 25 years, using increasingly sophisticated tags to track the movements and diving behavior of the seals during their foraging migrations, when they head out into the North Pacific Ocean for as long as 8 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dive records show that they are constantly diving, so we thought they must be sleeping during what we call drift dives, when they stop swimming and slowly sink, but we really didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; Costa said. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re finally able to say they&#8217;re definitely sleeping during those dives, and we also found that they&#8217;re not sleeping very much overall compared to other mammals.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, during their months at sea, elephant seals rival the record for the least sleep among all mammals, currently held by African elephants, which appear to sleep just two hours per day based on their movement patterns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elephant seals are unusual in that they switch between getting a lot of sleep when they&#8217;re on land, over 10 hours a day, and two hours or less when they&#8217;re at sea,&#8221; said Kendall-Bar, who is currently a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego&#8217;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<h2>Safe place to sleep</h2>
<p>Elephant seals are most vulnerable to predators such as sharks and killer whales when they are at the surface in the open ocean, so they only spend a minute or two breathing at the surface in between dives.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re able to hold their breath for a long time, so they can go into a deep slumber on these dives deep below the surface where it&#8217;s safe,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said.</p>
<p>Kendall-Bar <a href="https://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40317-022-00287-x">developed a system</a> that can reliably record brain activity (as an electroencephalogram or EEG) in wild elephant seals during their normal diving behavior at sea. With a neoprene headcap to secure the EEG sensors and a small data logger to record the signals, the system can be recovered when the animals return to the beach at A&#241;o Nuevo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used the same sensors you&#8217;d use for a human sleep study at a sleep clinic and a removable, flexible adhesive to attach the headcap so that water couldn&#8217;t get in and disrupt the signals,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said.</p>
<p>In addition to the EEG system, the seals carried time-depth recorders, accelerometers, and other instruments that allowed the researchers to track the seals&#8217; movements along with the corresponding brain activity. The recordings show diving seals going into the deep sleep stage known as slow-wave sleep while maintaining a controlled glide downward, then transitioning into rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when sleep paralysis causes them to turn upside down and drift downwards in a &#8220;sleep spiral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They go into slow-wave sleep and maintain their body posture for several minutes before they transition into REM sleep, when they lose postural control and turn upside down,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said.</p>
<p>At the depths at which this happens, the seals are usually negatively buoyant and continue to fall passively in a corkscrew spiral &#8220;like a falling leaf,&#8221; Williams said. In shallower waters over the continental shelf, elephant seals sometimes sleep while resting on the seafloor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible that they would truly go into paralytic REM sleep during a dive, but it tells us something about the decision-making processes of these seals to see where in the water column they feel safe enough to go to sleep,&#8221; said Williams, who directs the Comparative Neurophysiology Lab at UCSC.</p>
<h2>Sleep recordings</h2>
<p>In developing the new EEG instrument, Kendall-Bar first deployed it on elephant seals housed temporarily in the marine mammal facilities at UCSC&#8217;s Long Marine Laboratory. The next step was to deploy it on animals in the elephant seal colony at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve north of Santa Cruz, where researchers could observe the animals on the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent a lot of time watching sleeping seals,&#8221; Kendall-Bar said. &#8220;Our team monitored instrumented seals to make sure they were able to reintegrate with the colony and were behaving naturally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of those seals took short excursions into the water, but to observe diving behavior the researchers used a translocation procedure developed by Costa&#8217;s lab. Juvenile female elephant seals outfitted with the EEG sensors and trackers were transported from A&#241;o Nuevo to Monterey and released on a beach at the southern end of Monterey Bay. Over the next few days, the animals would swim back to A&#241;o Nuevo across the deep Monterey Canyon, where their dive behavior is very similar to that seen during much longer foraging trips in the open ocean.</p>
<p>With data on brain activity and dive behavior from 13 juvenile female elephant seals, including a total of 104 sleep dives, Kendall-Bar developed a highly accurate algorithm for identifying periods of sleep based on the dive data alone. This enabled her to estimate sleep quotas for 334 adult seals using dive data recorded over several months during their foraging trips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the dataset that Dan Costa has curated over 25 years of working with elephant seals at A&#241;o Nuevo, I was able to extrapolate our results to over 300 animals and get a population-level look at sleep behavior,&#8221; said Kendall-Bar, who now plans to use similar methods to study brain activity in other species of seals and sea lions and in human freedivers.</p>
<p>Williams called Kendall-Bar&#8217;s work on the project a tour de force. &#8220;It&#8217;s an amazing feat to pull this off,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She developed an EEG system to work on an animal that&#8217;s diving several hundred meters in the ocean. Then she uses the data to create data-driven animations so we can really visualize what the animal is doing as it dives through the water column.&#8221;</p>
<p>The results may be helpful for conservation efforts by revealing a &#8220;sleepscape&#8221; of preferred resting areas, Williams said. &#8220;Normally, we&#8217;re concerned about protecting the areas where animals go to feed, but perhaps the places where they sleep are as important as any other critical habitat,&#8221; she said.</p>

intelligence (AI), Amazon Alexa products are advancing every day. To provide students hands-on opportunities to develop smarter, more efficient, and more collaborative conversational AI systems to power their Amazon Alexa agents, Amazon created three university competitions: SimBot, SocialBot, and TaskBot.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although each of the three challenges tasks teams to develop an AI-powered bot for a specific purpose for a chance to win $500,000 or more, they all aim to advance the fields of conversational embodied AI, natural language generation, and human-AI interaction.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz was one of only two universities&#8212;along with Virginia Tech&#8212;selected to compete in all three Alexa Prize competitions, and is now the only university still active in all three. The UCSC teams competing in the SimBot and SocialBot competitions are currently top ranked, and the TaskBot challenge is just getting underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of every team member,&#8221; said Xin (Eric) Wang, assistant professor of computer science and engineering and the faculty advisor for the three UCSC teams. &#8220;All three teams are doing a great job of working together, splitting up tasks, and finding new ways to improve the overall performance of the bots.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>SimBot Challenge</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inaugural </span><a href="https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/simbot-challenge"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SimBot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> competition seeks to advance virtual assistant technology by developing a next-generation bot capable of completing real-world tasks, like preparing breakfast or cleaning a room, while continuously learning from its environment so it can perform commonsense reasoning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our bot combines learning-based systems and symbolic reasoning systems to jointly interact with humans and complete tasks,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;Both the conversational element and developing a modular system is crucial for not just this competition, but for all three.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SlugJARVIS, a team of UCSC computer science and engineering Ph.D. students who work in Wang&#8217;s lab, was one of 10 university teams selected globally to compete in the 2022&#8211;23 SimBot competition. </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/04/2022-alexa-prize.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning the public benchmark phase last spring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the team has continued to excel in the competition and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/simbot-challenge/one"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently advanced to the finals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The final five teams will compete for a chance to win half a million dollars.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The best part of being SlugJARVIS&#8217;s team lead is collaborating with my awesome team members to explore embodied AI research and deploy that to be used by Amazon customers,&#8221; said Jing Gu, a computer science and engineering Ph.D. student at the Baskin School of Engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any Amazon Alexa customer can interact with one of the 10 SimBots by saying, &#8220;Alexa, play with robot" on Echo Show or Fire TV devices. Once connected to a randomly selected bot, customers direct bots to complete increasingly difficult tasks in a virtual environment. At the end of the interaction, customers have the chance to anonymously rate and provide feedback on the bot&#8217;s performance, which plays into the overall rankings and gives the team a chance to improve their bot&#8217;s performance as the competition continues.</span></p>
<p><strong>SocialBot Challenge</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Team Athena was one of nine teams selected for the fifth Amazon Alexa </span><a href="https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/socialbot-grand-challenge"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SocialBot Grand Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a competition focused on designing a bot that is capable of carrying out 20-minute coherent and engaging conversations on a wide range of topics with Alexa customers. This is the fourth time UCSC has been selected to compete in this competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s Team Athena has focused on reviving their previous SocialBot and enhancing it with human-in-the-loop-based learning models and neural language understanding aimed at recognizing the intent of the human customer and preparing the bot to converse on any topic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separate prizes will be awarded for teams achieving the best overall performance and teams demonstrating the greatest scientific invention and innovation, with prizes up to $250,000 for the top-finishing team in each of those prize categories.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team Athena lead and computer science and engineering Ph.D. student Yue Fan is excited about improving their current system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Athena SocialBot is an accumulation of all modules that were built over the past few years, so there is a lot already there that we can work with and improve upon,&#8221; Fan said. &#8220;We&#8217;re most interested in employing neural based language models to advance the bot&#8217;s ability to engage customers in longer and more interesting conversations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SocialBot Grand Challenge live-interaction phase has just begun and Team Athena is already at the top of the scoreboard. Amazon Alexa customers can chat with the team bots by saying, &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s chat,&#8221; which randomly connects them with one of the nine bots in the competition.</span></p>
<p><strong>TaskBot Challenge</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/taskbot-challenge"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second TaskBot Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began in early 2023. Team UCSC, also known as Team Sage, is competing for the first time. Comprised of both Baskin Engineering undergraduate and graduate students and led by computer science and engineering Ph.D. student Kaizhi Zheng, Team Sage is one of 10 teams selected for this competition. The team is developing a system that can assist humans in completing complex tasks, like fixing a car or cooking a meal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to build a human-friendly interface that allows for a seamless and intuitive experience,&#8221; Wang said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TaskBot will guide humans in completing multi-step tasks by providing thorough instructions via a multimodal format, incorporating a mix of videos, images, text, and audio.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Team Sage has recently completed the challenge&#8217;s bootcamp and passed the required skills test.

She was born in Berkeley on January 16, 1947, the daughter of Edward and Elizabeth (nee Sauer) FitzSimmons. After an undergraduate degree in psychology from Stanford (1969), she chose geography as the focus of her graduate work, earning her M.A. from Cal State Northridge in 1975 and a Ph.D. in Geography from UCLA in 1983. Her dissertation examined the interaction of nature, labor, and capital in the agricultural industrialization of the Salinas Valley and was a masterful analysis of the political ecologies and environmental history of this important agricultural region. She was recognized for the best paper based on a dissertation with the American Association of Geographers J. Warren Nystrom Award. Her dissertation publications included an important paper in the journal <em>Economic Geography</em>.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was appointed as an assistant professor of Urban Planning at UCLA in 1980, where she strengthened the department&#8217;s environmental concentration. In 1991, UCLA gave her a distinguished teaching award for the many new courses she introduced, for her expertise in teaching theory, and her work as a mentor to countless students, including many students of color. Her 1989 article &#8220;The matter of nature&#8221; in the radical geography journal&#160;<em>Antipode</em>, which theorized the social construction of nature as a deeply human relation to the environment, has been cited hundreds of times. She also wrote a book on water in California, <em>Thirst for Growth</em>, with Robert Gottlieb. In 1994, she was recruited as a professor to join the Department of Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she continued her deep dedication to student mentoring and teaching, her thoughtful support of her colleagues, and her commitment to a sustainable and socially just agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margaret was brilliant, articulate, widely read, passionate about social and environmental justice, incisive, and incredibly kind. She was sought after for the role of discussant at national meetings of social scientists and geographers. Some of her breadth of knowledge was derived from and inspired by her beloved grandfather, long-standing UC Berkeley geographer Carl O. Sauer, who was well-versed in ecological and botanical knowledge. Her approach to agricultural studies combined modes of thought and knowledge spanning from political ecology to environmental history to ecosystem processes. Thus, she became a strong bridge between natural and social scientists in the department and an asset to the development of interdisciplinary research by our faculty and graduate students on sustainable food systems. Margaret continued to collaborate with, mentor, and support students and colleagues after her retirement, including hosting dinners for new faculty engaged in food studies. Her last publication entitled, "Pest management within the environment: challenges for agronomists, ecologists, economists and policy makers," was a collaborative study with two agroecologists of social factors driving pest pressure and pest control options in Pajaro Valley strawberry production over the last 100 years.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, there will be no formal service or public event. You might take a moment to remember Margaret in the gardens, redwoods, and oak woodlands that she loved. In lieu of flowers you may wish to honor Margaret with a donation to one of the charities she supported such as Environment California, KQED Public radio, Walnut Street Health Clinic, the Earth Island Institute, or Monterey Bay Aquarium.

Housed in </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute at UCSC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, WIITH is a community-driven public history initiative to preserve and uplift stories of Filipino migration and labor in the city of Watsonville and the greater Pajaro Valley.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting oral history accounts, photos, personal records, and material culture objects, the WIITH team has created </span><a href="https://wiith.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> documenting the plight, struggles, vitality, and resilience of Filipino migrants&#8211;the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">manong</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generation who first settled in the Pajaro Valley in the early twentieth century and their families.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p>WIITH is an interdisciplinary initiative supported&#160;by three different divisions on campus: Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts. &#160;Team members hail from the different divisions, and each has been responsible for advancing some part of the project. THI provides the most infrastructural and administrative support.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NEH funding will support </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sowing Seeds: Filipino American Stories from the Pajaro Valley, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">an art and history exhibition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is set to open at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History in April 2024. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sowing Seeds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will bring together original oral history interviews, archival research, and contemporary works of art that present&#160; insightful and sometimes conflicting narratives of belonging, community formation, and memory preservation. Acclaimed artists such as </span><a href="https://wofflehouse.com/"><strong>Jenifer Wofford,</strong></a><a href="https://johannapoethig.com/"> <strong>Johanna Poethig</strong></a><strong>, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="https://binhdanh.com/"> <strong>Binh Danh</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will take part in this display of visual storytelling.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder spoke of the importance of public humanities grants funding high-impact community-engaged research projects such as WIITH and Sowing Seeds. &#8220;Humanities research can center the histories&#160; of people who have been marginalized and overlooked,&#8221; Alinder said. &#8220;WIITH and Sowing Seeds are projects that put stakeholders at the very center, sharing the history and voices of the Central Coast Filipino American community, offering insight into collective memory and resilience.&#8221;</span><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sowing Seeds </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exemplifies the type of critical public humanities work THI is dedicated to advancing,&#8221; said Irena Poli&#263;, managing director of The Humanities Institute. &#8220;The exhibition and educational resources that the WIITH team will create will share a vital part of U.S. history and provide new understandings of Asian American migration. In the face of continued anti-Asian violence in the U.S., this initiative could not be more important.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve McKay, UCSC associate professor of sociology,&#160; director of the <a href="https://labor.ucsc.edu">Center for Labor and Community</a> and co-principal investigator of the Watsonville is in the Heart Research Initiative, said the project grant will help the initiative, community members and partners preserve and share a vital history. &#8220;The labor and family history of Filipinos in the Pajaro Valley has for too long remained invisible and un-recognized and I am so proud that our collaborative project is helping bring that inspiring history to a broad, national and international audience,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIITH&#8217;s co-principal investigator, Kathleen &#8220;Kat&#8221; Cruz Gutierrez, assistant professor of history at UCSC, spoke of the origins of Sowing Seeds and how far the project has come from its humble beginnings.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that we started as a series of phone calls, emails, and Zoom conversations in 2020, only to be awarded such a prestigious honor this year,&#8221; Gutierrez said. &#8220;Our community partners have propelled this initiative from the start, and I&#8217;m so glad we can help materialize their vision. The documented history of Filipinos in the Pajaro Valley was once unacceptably slim, and our campus-community research initiative has been addressing that. This recognition is a promise for more meaningful work ahead.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is an incredible honor to have our art and history exhibition recognized,&#8221; said Christina Ayson Plank, PhD candidate in Visual Studies at UCSC and head curator of Watsonville is in the Heart. &#8220;This award validates what we as a team have known from the beginning&#8212;that community-engaged research is rigorous, dynamic, and vital. With this award, we will be able to continue collaborating with the Filipino community in the Pajaro Valley to curate traveling versions of the exhibition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an emerging scholar and curator, Ayson Plank sees the award as an opportunity to further expand on WIITH&#8217;s historical and art historical research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the NEH award, our team will have the privilege to continue working to fulfill our community partners' goals to amplify Pajaro Valley Filipino American history,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meleia Simon-Reynolds</span><strong>,&#160; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-director of the WIITH digital archive. Simon-Reynolds, a Ph.D. candidate in History researching Filipino labor, migration, and photography at UCSC, also leads WIITH's oral history project and its work to develop educational resources on local Filipino American histories.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It goes to show that hard work and dedication can overcome many challenges,&#8221; said Dioscoro &#8220;Roy&#8221; Recio, founder of the </span><a href="https://www.toberaproject.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tobera Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a grassroots organization and WITH community partner that brings together Filipino community members in Watsonville and the greater Pajaro Valley to uplift their history and culture.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIITH has its origins in The Tobera Project. Recio, along with other community members, mounted an exhibition entitled 'Watsonville is in the Heart'&#160; in early 2020 on Filipinos in the Pajaro Valley. Recio reached out to UCSC faculty and graduate students to form a partnership for extensive historical preservation. WIITH launched formally in early 2021. The Tobera Project is WIITH&#8217;s conduit to oral history narrators and archive contributors, and helps to organize and promote events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am proud that we have maintained a strong sense of community awareness and participation: with the people, by the people and for the people,&#8221; Recio said. &#8220;I think our ancestors would be very honored.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIITH was also honored with another prestigious award this week - the 2023-24 Engaging Humanities Grant from the&#160;<span>University of California Humanities Research Institute, which facilitates experimental, interdisciplinary humanities scholarship through partnerships, research initiatives, and competitive grants.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>This grant will enable WIITH to</span></span>&#160;partner with UC Berkeley to create an interactive digital source that will map the locations most significant to the 1930 anti-Filipino race riots. The map will draw from archival sources at the Bancroft Library, the archives of the Filipino American National Historical Society, among others, and WIITH's own growing collection to highlight the refuge Filipino communities sought and built, and their summary refusals by society at large during this tumultuous&#160;history. Meleia Simon-Reynolds will be the lead graduate student researcher on this grant. Simon-Reynolds will work alongside UC Berkeley graduate student Josh Acosta and two undergraduates, one from UC Santa Cruz, the other from UC Berkeley, to ensure that the map can launch by the 2024 exhibition&#160;and be available for inclusion in high school ethnic studies curricula.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like Emerson, I believe that fullness in life comes from following our calling,&#8221; said Edward Hirsch, president of the Guggenheim Foundation and 1985 Fellow in poetry. &#8220;The new class of Fellows has followed their calling to enhance all our lives, to provide greater human knowledge and deeper understanding. We&#8217;re lucky to look to them to bring us into the future.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel is a media artist and innovator in the field of interactive documentary. She creates online artworks and multimedia installations that examine social, racial and environmental injustice. She is especially interested in mass incarceration and injustice in the criminal legal system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am very gratified by the fact that this prestigious foundation is willing to support and promote this kind of work,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she will use the fellowship to work on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasonable Doubt</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an interactive documentary and installation that will &#8220;document the many forms of official misconduct and abuse that lead to the wrongful convictions of Black men and women - exposing the systemic ordinariness of racist arrests and prosecutions.&#8221; The installation will focus on the case of Timothy James Young, a black man Daniel believes was wrongfully convicted. Young, who is on death row in San Quentin State Prison, &#8220;will serve as a narrative through-line linking the stories of black exonerees and appellants to demonstrate how structural racism undermines the credibility of our criminal legal system and ruins lives.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel said Young&#8217;s wrongful death penalty conviction &#8220;was based on the false testimony of a jailhouse informant, unreliable eyewitness testimony, witness intimidation, evidence tampering, racially biased jury selection, ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and judicial abuse of discretion.&#8221; Young is one example &#8220;among many, of the unacceptable injustices inflicted on real people by an unreliable and unaccountable system of policing, prosecution and punishment,&#8221; Daniel said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is scheduled to launch with the installation in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abolition Futures </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the San Jos&#233; Museum of Art in spring 2024.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel met Young through </span><a href="http://unjustlyexposed.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposed</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a project she completed documenting the spread of COVID-19 in prisons, jails and detention centers through quotes, audio clips and statistics assembled in an interactive timelines.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two other major projects involving the legal system that Daniel has created are&#160; </span><a href="http://www.sharondaniel.net/bloodsugar"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood Sugar</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.sharondaniel.net/#publicsecrets"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Secrets</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood Sugar </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an interactive documentary examining the social and political construction of poverty and addiction. The project features testimony of 20 current and former injection drug users recorded at the HIV Education and Prevention Program of Alameda County and in California state prisons, and linked it with social theory and biological research.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sharondaniel.net/#publicsecrets"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Secrets</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an online audio archive of hundreds of hundreds of statements made by incarcerated women that &#8220;unmask the secret injustices of the war on drugs, the criminal justice system, and the prison industrial complex. &#8220;The injustices of the prison industrial complex are public secrets - secrets that the public chooses to keep safe from itself like &#8216;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell,&#8221; Daniel says on her website.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friz is a radio and sound artist, composer, performer and installation artist. Her work reflects upon media ecologies, land use, infrastructure, time perception and critical fictions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I applied to the Guggenheim Fellowship in order to gain the most valuable, elusive gift that any artist needs: time,&#8221; she said, explaining that she has to balance research and creative practice with teaching and service commitments. &#8220;For me, working on longer form projects requires not only practical time to engage in research and fieldwork, production and post-production work, but more than anything time in which to cultivate and hold a state of mind that is more open, able to embrace tangents and curiosities, in which to deepen my relationships to thinking and making around a particular set of questions and experiences. The fellowship will give me more of this creative, open time.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friz will use the fellowship to compose </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children of the Sun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 50-minute radio piece that will critique the ongoing exploitation in the salt flats of Chile&#8217;s Atacama Desert. The conditions there are so similar to Mars that billionaires are considering how mining techniques developed there might be used for off-planet mining. The work will be a suite, following the cycle of a 24-hour period in the salt flats. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children of the Sun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reconsiders the history and fate of the industrialized desert by simultaneously listening to the Salar de Atacama as a place at the bottom of a sea, as a high-altitude mining site criss-crossed by infrastructure, and as inspiration for off-planet dreams,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I seek to shift audience perception of the desert, to understand it as more than &#8216;wasteland&#8217; to be exploited, and to reframe the goals of extra-planetary travel away from dominion and exploitation, and toward listening and adaptation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friz&#8217;s piece will be completed by fall 2024 with a premiere set in winter 2025 on ORF Kunstradio, the radio art program of the cultural channel of Austria national public radio. A live multi-channel concert will also be ready to premiere in winter 2025.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of Athletics and Recreation Susan Harriman will be stepping down effective May 5th, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harriman came to UC Santa Cruz in 2018. She led an organizational restructuring and rebranding that strengthened and enhanced the diverse programs in the unit.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under her leadership, the university became a founding member of the Coast-To-Coast (C2C) Athletic Conference in 2020. Since then, the Banana Slugs have won four conference championships, five Banana Slugs earning C2C Player of the Year honors and six coaches receiving Conference Coach of the Year honors. In 2020, men&#8217;s swimming and diving won the program&#8217;s first-ever Pacific Collegiate Swim and Dive Conference title.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harriman has brought new energy, subject-matter knowledge, and support for student success. Athletic milestones achieved over the last five and half years include eight teams participating in the NCAA championships, women&#8217;s cross country making its NCAA nationals debut as a team in 2022 and the men&#8217;s volleyball team being national runners-up in 2019.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In advancing our recreational activities, Harriman focused on ensuring A&amp;R programs and facilities were available to all students. Through a partnership with UCSC&#8217;s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), more opportunities have opened for students to participate in recreational programs at no additional cost. The Slug Membership program was restructured so students and other Slug Recreation members could participate in group exercise programming as part of their existing membership. And during the pandemic, staff innovation for virtual programming ensured students and other members of the recreation community had access to fitness and wellness programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Associate Director of Athletics and Recreation and Senior Woman Administrator Courtnie Prather will serve as interim director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to thank Director Harriman for her vision and leadership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,<br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lori</span></p>

<p>The new agreement approves updated indirect cost rates through June of 2026 for each activity type, including a slight escalation annually over the next three years for organized research.</p>
<p>The federally negotiated rate for organized research at the UC Santa Cruz campus is now 55% for FY23 and FY24 and will increase to 56% as of 7/1/2024.&#160;</p>

<p><span>As part of a class project, students in the fall used at-home lead test strips on campus. While we had learned the students detected lead, we did not know the specific locations students tested until Thursday. We immediately had our professional staff collect water samples and send them to an accredited lab for independent evaluation.</span></p>
<p><span>I&#8217;m happy to report that this sensitive and accurate testing of our water samples did not detect any lead. The tests conducted were extremely rigorous. The limit of detection for these analyses was 1 microgram/liter. In addition to collecting samples from the drinking fountain at Porter College tested by students using at-home test strips, we sourced samples from throughout the entire residential building. We also collected samples from the East Field House. All results came back negative for lead.</span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate the reporting of at-home test strip information. These kits are intended to provide a simple indication of the presence or absence of potential contaminants. They are easy to use and widely accessible, but are limited in accuracy. The campus will continue to follow up promptly on any reports of water quality concerns from at-home tests. In the coming days, the results of the campus tests will be available on the </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/environmental/drinking-water.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1681947975091000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bwHm2yQWHRJ_h1huQeiRI" href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/environmental/drinking-water.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Environmental Health and Safety website</span></a></span><span>. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>We're grateful to those who helped bring this information to our attention and for the concern of our community members for promoting safety. The safety of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority, and I hope that the test results are reassuring to everyone in our community.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Ed Reiskin,  Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations, and Administration   </admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9a1751a9807270462271addb0a77a626"><name>shapiro-american-academy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Biologist Beth Shapiro elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</title><summary>Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious honorary societies.</summary><start-date>1681887600000</start-date><display-name>Biologist Beth Shapiro elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</display-name><path>/2023/04/shapiro-american-academy</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/shapiro-american-academy</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1681917432202</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1681922776964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/beth-shapiro-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/beth-shapiro-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beth-shapiro-350.jpg</name><display-name>beth-shapiro-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>116441</file-size><width>350</width><height>427</height></image><image-alt>Beth Shapiro</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/beth-shapiro-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/beth-shapiro-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beth-shapiro-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>beth-shapiro-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30831</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Beth Shapiro</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Beth Shapiro (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation&#8217;s oldest and most prestigious honorary societies.</p>
<p>Shapiro was among nearly 270 new members of the academy announced this week, including author Zadie Smith, songwriter and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, and climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. Shapiro joins 28 other UCSC faculty who are fellows of the academy.</p>
<p>A leader in the field of paleogenomics and ancient DNA, Shapiro uses genetic material recovered from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago to study evolution and explore how species and ecosystems have changed over time. She is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator and HHMI professor, and she leads the <a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Paleogenomics Lab</a> with Ed Green, professor of biomolecular engineering.</p>
<p>Shapiro&#8217;s lab develops techniques to recover increasingly trace amounts of DNA from museum, environmental, and forensic samples, and then uses these data to study how species and ecosystems evolved through time. She is particularly interested in understanding environmental changes in the past and learning more about the changing human footprint on our planet. Her findings can help inform present-day decisions related to the conservation and management of endangered species and habitats.</p>

The meeting brought together chemistry faculty and students from across the UC system to discuss challenges and share ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;When our department&#8217;s DEI committee meets to discuss these issues, we wonder what other UC campuses are doing. We all face similar challenges, and we thought it would be helpful to get together and share ideas,&#8221; said Seth Rubin, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, who spearheaded the organization of the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone belongs in STEM, and we know that building community is a powerful mechanism for creating that sense of belonging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is an important step toward increasing diversity and equity, and we hope this will be a regular gathering in the years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>UCSC Chancellor Cindy Larive gave opening remarks at the conference, noting that there were not many women or people of color in the field of chemistry when she entered it in the 1970s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is something we have to be really intentional about, and there is so much power in what we can do to advance diversity and inclusion by working across all the UC campuses,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The event was organized around three themes: graduate student inclusion and recruitment; graduate student mentoring and success; and faculty recruitment and retention.</p>
<p>Rigoberto Hernandez, professor of chemistry at Johns Hopkins University and director of the Open Chemistry Collaborative in Diversity Equity (OXIDE), gave a keynote address in which he discussed OXIDE&#8217;s work tracking the demographics of U.S. chemistry faculty and identifying barriers faced by underrepresented groups. He has helped organize National Diversity Equity Workshops to engage with department chairs and develop recommendations for achieving inclusive excellence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to have increasing participation in these workshops. The community sees value in the networking and community engagement, and we are beginning to see an uptick in the hiring of faculty from diverse groups,&#8221; Hernandez said.</p>
<p>Alegra Eroy-Reveles, associate teaching professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, discussed ideas for designing a more equitable hiring process for faculty. A graduate of Watsonville High School who earned her Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz, Eroy-Reveles talked about the changing demographics of high school graduates in California and how important it is for the UC faculty to reflect those changes. She is working with colleagues at other UC campuses as a co-principal investigator of a project funded by the National Science Foundation with the goal of increasing the number of Latinx teaching-focused STEM faculty.</p>
<p>Eroy-Reveles said many students have told her she was the first Latinx science teacher they&#8217;d had. &#8220;This is why I&#8217;m here&#8212;it is so important for students to see people like them in the faculty,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A session on graduate student climate, mentoring, and support included a plenary talk by Joerg Schlatterer, who discussed his work at the American Chemical Society (ACS) on the ACS Bridge Program, an effort to increase the number of underrepresented students earning doctoral degrees in the chemical sciences. The ACS is one of five leading scientific societies that have formed the Inclusive Graduate Education Network (IGEN) to increase the participation of women and underrepresented groups in graduate studies in the physical sciences.</p>
<p>Rubin said the conference was a valuable opportunity to hear about efforts at other institutions as UCSC&#8217;s chemistry department continues to make changes to address challenges in diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have implemented changes to try to close equity gaps in the classroom, restructuring the general chemistry curriculum and introducing new teaching practices and undergraduate research labs that we think will help increase persistence in STEM, especially for underrepresented students,&#8221; Rubin said. &#8220;We are also taking steps to improve the faculty hiring process and increase the diversity of the applicant pool. I think we&#8217;re headed in the right direction, but there is a lot more work to do.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a08c002580727046443cbef01f1ddd4b"><name>mens-rugby-2023</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>From the ground up: UCSC Men's Rugby finishes historic season</title><summary>Jeremy Sanford, Patrick Halpin, Guido Bordignon, Simon Nicholls, and Marcus Viscardi are the forces behind one of UCSC's most historic and competitive sports teams on campus: Rugby.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rugby was the first sport to arrive at UC Santa Cruz in 1967. Coached first by Ron Ruby and then by Dave Dorfan, both professors in physics who volunteered their time to coaching, the team slowly made its way to competing against other universities with great success.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now over five decades later, the UCSC Men&#8217;s Rugby Club is coached by five men&#8212;three of whom are academic faculty&#8212; who helped elevate the Banana Slugs to D1A status for the first time in the team&#8217;s history. As the dust settles on their inaugural season, the team demonstrated they belong in D1A. Wins over UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara highlighted a competitive season in the D1A California Conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we played some really fantastic rugby at different points in the season,&#8221; said UCSC Men&#8217;s Rugby Head Coach Jeremy Sanford. &#8220;The first 40 minutes of our final match against SDSU, being a great example of our style of play. We learned a lot about ourselves this season and have a better understanding of areas to build on going into next year.&#8221;&#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford added that the UCSC players were the ones who ultimately made the decision to play at the D1A level with the coaches full support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think moving to D1A was the right decision for the team,&#8221; said coach Marcus Viscardi. &#8220;In matches this season with the top teams from the D1AA California Conference, we defeated Fresno State and Sacramento State by large margins. The team has a different mindset now.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford, Viscardi, Patrick Halpin, Guido Bordignon, and Simon Nicholls are the coaches of the team, all of whom emphasized the competitive success of the season is a result of the players&#8217; passion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inclusive and hard-working culture of rugby known worldwide takes center stage on UCSC&#8217;s Rugby team. The players&#8217; ability to push one another and strive for excellence set them up for success in their D1 debut, fighting to the bitter end for their wins against other universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incredibly rigorous sport breeds an unbreakable culture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can&#8217;t survive on a rugby field without a high level of personal integrity,&#8221; Nicholls said. &#8220;You have to commit, you have to expose yourself, you have to perform, and you&#8217;ve got to pull your weight. Rugby sorts people out, and the ones who can&#8217;t do that will get left by the wayside, and the other guys will galvanize around a culture that breeds excellence and personal integrity. We see kids come into UC Santa Cruz at 18 years old, and by the time they leave, they&#8217;re different people.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Going international and looking ahead</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking UCSC&#8217;s Rugby teams outside of the country has been a dream of rugby coaches and alumni for years, and soon, it&#8217;s becoming a reality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of rugby alumni and the UCSC global engagement office, the UCSC Rugby Team will play against the University of Padova in Italy in the Summer of 2024. Recently celebrating its 800th anniversary, The University of Padova is one of the world&#8217;s most historic and renowned universities. The match between UCSC and the University of Padova celebrates a newfound friendship between the two universities, both of whom share achievements and recognition in biomedical sciences, astronomy, and rugby.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Coach Bordignon is an alumnus of the University of Padova and is grateful for the opportunity for the Banana Slugs to play against a prestigious rugby team.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This opportunity to have such a significant cultural experience as a young person is one that many of the players would otherwise never have; most of them never left the country and/or are the first college generation in their families,&#8221; Bordignon said. &#8220;Thinking that my alma mater [University of Padova], UC Santa Cruz, and rugby are now connected for the players as well, and the influence that this experience will have on their futures, gives me such profound joy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With two matches remaining, The UCSC Men&#8217;s Rugby team has their sights set on a winning record in their inaugural D1 seasons. Regardless of the outcome, the team&#8217;s performance this season is likely to send a message.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is on people&#8217;s radar; we&#8217;re in the rugby media quite a lot,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;Everybody loves the Banana Slugs, so we get a lot of contact from high school students. Since we announced the move to D1, we&#8217;ve been attracting talented, intellectually driven rugby players here.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Jeremy Sanford</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Sanford has coached rugby at UCSC for 14 years and is the team&#8217;s head coach. A molecular, cellular, and developmental (MCD) biology professor at UCSC, </span><a href="https://sanfordlab.mcdb.ucsc.edu/Sanford_Lab/Welcome.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford&#8217;s lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studies messenger RNA biogenesis and expression. He is interested in how aberrant mRNA biogenesis contributes to disease and is designing drugs to correct problematic RNA in cells.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasizes the importance of having a passion and a team to commit to while being a student at UCSC and often encourages his biology students to try out for the team. Sanford says it helps to teach in one of the most popular majors on campus where he meets a lot of students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Over the years I realized there are many parallels between rugby and science,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The heart of both endeavors is to go forward and attack gaps. Perhaps most importantly, both disciplines require commitment and resilience. I doubt I would have been as successful in research without some of the values that I picked up from rugby.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford began playing rugby late in his college years at Case Western Reserve University&#160; Cleveland, Ohi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing his Ph.D., he moved to Edinburgh, Scotland to pursue post-doctoral research and rugby.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There were seven clubs within walking distance of my lab and upon joining Edinburgh Northern Rugby Football Club, I was instantly connected to a diverse group of players from all over the world,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;The season spanned the majority of the year. For an American like me, it was like earning an advanced degree in Rugby.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says he is appreciative of the rugby players for their dedication and is grateful to the other coaches for their leadership.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of the effort the students put in. They work really hard balancing training and their studies. Everyone of our players wants to leave the team in a better position than when they joined it. That kind of commitment is why we can punch well-above our weight.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Patrick Halpin&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patrick Halpin had a rugby ball in his hand the day he was born. Born and raised in Kilkenny, Ireland, Halpin&#8217;s relationship with rugby is written into his DNA. His father was the president of a local rugby club, and his brothers played the game. Halpin attended a boarding school where he played rugby, and after he finished school, he played club rugby in London and New York.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he moved to California in the 90s, he assumed his rugby career was coming to an end. In 2003 Halpin suffered a brain injury.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting encouragement from friends and family, Halpin looked for a way to get back involved in the sport that defined most of his life. He found the Banana Slugs in 2013, and now ten years later, Halpin says coaching the team significantly helped with his recovery, and he wouldn&#8217;t want to be anywhere else.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC Rugby has helped me so much with my personal growth and development,&#8221; Halpin said. &#8220;These guys are good students and are coming down and putting the effort in. Some days, the players were getting up at six in the morning and practicing, motivating me to get up and do something as well. It has very much helped me to grow as a person.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Simon Nicholls&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After playing rugby for over 20 years in the UK and Canada&#8212;including two seasons with the Bristol Bears&#8212;Simon Nicholls knew he wanted to stay connected to the sport when he moved to Santa Cruz. He has been a coach at UCSC for six years and serves as the D1A Conference Commissioner.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicholls says he is proud of the growth of UCSC&#8217;s rugby team over the years and its growing culture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very inclusive culture, and it is one where you have to pull your weight,&#8221; Nicholls said. &#8220;You have to show personal integrity, you have to show commitment, and then you&#8217;ll survive and thrive in a fabulous environment.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Guido Bordignon&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guido Bordignon is a professor of MCD biology at UCSC and has coached rugby at the university for four years. Bordignon&#8217;s research focuses on active learning pedagogy, inclusive teaching, scientific teaching practices, and gamification of the classroom.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bordignon and Sanford were awarded a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation in 2022 for their work in faculty-led labs offering </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/undergraduate-research.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the MCD Biology Department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bordignon grew up in Padova, one of the main cities in Northeast Italy, where rugby is a very popular game that he played since he was a kid. He played for the local team with which he won many national championships and played internationally at the junior level. He began coaching rugby at UCSC four years ago and is proud to be a Banana Slug.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am focused on mentorship of undergraduate students to support them with their confidence and growth during their college years,&#8221; Bordignon said. &#8220;Having been myself a student athlete, I know the power that high-level team sports can have on their holistic development. I find it rewarding to invest in their growth both on and off the field.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Marcus Viscardi&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Viscardi is a Ph.D. candidate in the MCD Biology department. He studies messenger RNA quality control mechanisms and mRNA translation and has been coaching rugby at UCSC for four years.

The sunny and warm weekend&#8212;reflective of perfect weather conditions in Santa Cruz&#8212;welcomed the crowds of past, present, and future Banana Slugs roaming across campus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the town.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 150 alumni from the golden alumni classes of 1965-1973 gathered to celebrate their 50th (or more) reunion milestone and reconnect with the university and friends. The class of 1973 celebrated their 50th reunion.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Reunion Weekend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was made up of over 20 events, including intimate college gatherings, time to mingle with current and admitted&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">students, and opportunities to explore the campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular events, The Then and Now Tours, provided alumni the opportunity to see changes to the UCSC campus. For some alumni it was the first time they had been on campus for over 30 years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was amazing to see these extraordinary alumni gather at UC Santa Cruz last weekend,&#8221; said Assistant Vice Chancellor of Alumni Engagement John D. Pine. &#8220;For many of our alumni, this was the first time they had been to campus in many years. We decided to take a new approach with Alumni Reunion Weekend this year, and it&#8217;s great to see the payoff. We are excited to welcome back these golden alumni classes every year.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Reunion Weekend also happened in conjunction with Banana Slug Day&#8212;an event welcoming newly admitted students to UCSC. The campus saw over 2,000 admitted students and their families, in addition to returning alumni.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Campus was buzzing on Saturday and the energy was contagious. Having Banana Slug Day happen alongside Alumni Reunion Weekend was such a special opportunity for our alumni, students and their families,&#8221; said Executive Director of Alumni Engagement Shayna Kent. &#8220;Cowell and Stevenson also hosted family day bringing current students and families to events. The dynamic between our pioneer alumni, current students, and admitted students was such a memorable and special event.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Trying something new&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s Alumni Engagement Team has been hard at work for months planning the reinvisioned alumni reunion weekend, and were ecstatic to see their work come to fruition last weekend.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In past years, 50th reunions have been spearheaded by alumni volunteers with the support of the UCSC alumni engagement team. Beginning in 2023, the alumni engagement team prioritized organizing and celebrating 50+ Reunion Classes&#8212;an important milestone for alumni and the campus. Honoring the first generation of alumni celebrates the founding vision for UCSC&#8217;s unique campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni celebrations have been split into two separate weekend events in the spring and summertime. This past weekend, UCSC hosted&#160; </span><a href="https://alumniweekend.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Reunion Weekend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> celebrating alumni who graduated 50+ years ago. Then, in August, the University will offer &#8220;Return to the Redwoods,&#8221; a first-of-its-kind residential campus experience where alumni will be able to stay overnight in the residence halls.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Return to the Redwoods&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return to the Redwoods will welcome alumni back to campus for a full weekend of celebration, Santa Cruz exploration, and outdoor adventures from August 18-20, 2023.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, alumni can spend the weekend on campus in either a traditional dorm setting, a full apartment, or find nearby accommodations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend will include outdoor adventure activities such as campus hikes, kayak tours, mountain biking, surf lessons, interactive campus experiences, and more. In addition, open houses across campus will be held, as well as evening activities in the Quarry Amphitheatre.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Return to the Redwoods is a program unlike any other,&#8221; Pine says. &#8220;This exciting and innovative event encourages alumni to reconnect with the physical UC Santa Cruz campus and invites them to relive their college experience for a weekend with friends and family. All alumni and their guests (children, friends, etc.) are welcome to come spend a weekend in the redwoods.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Researchers compared the resulting map with existing data on strontium isotope ratios from human remains to predict likely regions of origin within Angola for four individuals who had been buried in cemeteries for enslaved people across the Americas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team&#8217;s findings, published in the </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440323000535"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journal of Archaeological Science</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, demonstrate how detailed &#8220;isoscape&#8221; maps could help to fill gaps in historical knowledge about where people were originally captured and trafficked within the African continent. The method also offers a way to uncover personal stories from the unidentified remains of people who were enslaved.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Using these archeological methods is basically the only way of giving these individuals back their own life history, which has remained untold in the historical documents,&#8221; said Associate Professor of Anthropology Vicky Oelze, who led the research alongside postdoctoral researcher Xueye Wang.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oelze explained that while genetic analysis of human remains can trace a person&#8217;s ancestry back to a particular region, sophisticated forms of stable isotope analysis powered by machine learning can go further. These methods have the potential to actually estimate specifically where a person was born. And in the context of the African Diaspora, that means archaeologists can differentiate a first-generation enslaved person&#8212;who endured the passage from Africa&#8212;from other people with similar ancestry whose family had already been enslaved in the Americas for at least a generation.</span></p>
<h2>How it works: developing a new &#8216;isoscape&#8217; for Angola<strong>&#160;&#160;</strong></h2>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="map of Angola showing differences in isotope ratios" class="" height="273" src="images/isoscape-300.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="300"/>
<figcaption>The team's "isoscape" map of Angola.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strontium is an element present in soil that comes in several different chemical forms, called isotopes. The ratio of these isotopes to one another indicates the age and chemical composition of the bedrock in a given region of the planet. Plants at the base of the food chain take up strontium isotopes from the soil in ratios that can differ slightly from that of the bedrock or soil, and local animals then incorporate the strontium isotope ratios from plants into their developing bones and teeth via their diet. This means that the strontium ratio in certain parts of a person&#8217;s body reflects the geology and environmental conditions of the place where they grew up.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Archaeologists can perform a stable isotope analysis on human remains to determine strontium ratios. Usually, those results then need to be used in combination with many other types of archaeological or historical evidence in order to make claims about human migration, since multiple regions can have similar strontium ratio profiles. But the UCSC team knew that Angola&#8217;s geology was so unique that strontium ratios could potentially be used to identify an enslaved person who grew up in Angola with less additional evidence required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xueye Wang, lead author of the new paper, explained that Angola has ancient bedrock exposed at the surface on high plateaus near the center of the country, which gives the area very unique strontium isotope ratios. However, lack of samples from the broader region for use in stable isotope analysis has previously prevented archaeologists from pinpointing origins of human remains within Western Africa through strontium isotope ratios.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC archaeologists overcame that challenge by contacting a group of German botanists that had been collecting plant specimens across Angola. The botanists gave researchers permission to perform stable isotope analysis on 101 herbarium plant samples. The team then used machine learning to combine the strontium isotope data from those samples with information about elevation, soil characteristics, climate, and geological variables across Angola. The result was a predictive model that filled the gaps in isotope ratio values between sample sites in order to map out an &#8220;isoscape&#8221; of the entire country.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Using isoscapes to strengthen historical understanding</h2>
<figure class="image align-right"><img alt="Four maps of Angola with specific regions highlighted for greatest probability" class="" height="265" src="images/origin-mapping-400.jpg" width="400"/>
<figcaption>Predicting origins for four people buried across the Americas.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a demonstration of the potential applications for their new map, researchers reviewed prior strontium isotope analysis of human remains in the Americas. Some prior studies had identified enslaved people who might be from Sub-Saharan or West Africa, due to their unique strontium isotope ratios. The research team focused particularly on four individuals, who had been buried in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Caribbean island of St. Martin, the Mexican city of Campeche, and the Anson Street African Burial Ground in Charleston, South Carolina.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the new isoscape model, the team mapped out the most likely possible regions of origin for each person within Angola, based on their strontium isotope ratios. Researchers were especially successful in linking remains from Brazil and Mexico to very specific parts of Angola. This finding was consistent with historical knowledge about shipping routes in the southern transatlantic slave trade, said UCSC History Professor Gregory O&#8217;Malley, a coauthor on the paper and longtime contributor to the </span><a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slave Voyages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> historical database.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Oelze said that the team&#8217;s isoscape mapping methods provided significantly more detail and certainty on the African origins of first-generation enslaved people buried in the Americas than was previously possible through strontium isotope analysis work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the past, archaeologists have often had to &#8216;eyeball it&#8217; to say that the isotopes in human remains generally match what we&#8217;d expect to find in a particular region of the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But with this study, we handed that question over to a predictive model that helped us quantify this in a much more scientifically rigorous way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Malley added that this level of additional detail on first-generation enslaved people could help to answer lingering historical questions. While ship logs provide a relatively detailed picture of how Europeans trafficked enslaved people from Africa to the Americas and within the Americas, it&#8217;s more difficult to piece together where people came from before they reached the African coast. But those patterns within the continent had global impacts that linger to this day.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The question of origins within Africa has crucial implications for tracing culture in the African Diaspora,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What languages were people speaking? What religious beliefs were they carrying with them to the Americas? All of those kinds of questions require greater detail about where people were coming from within Africa.

I'm looking forward to developing our promising preliminary work into technology that could have a real impact on the world.&#8221;<br/><br/>Josephson is creating a new technique for agricultural soil sensing that pairs wireless underground tags with an aboveground mobile reader. This will enable completely wireless soil measurements with low maintenance and deployment costs, while achieving high accuracy and high resolution.<br/><br/>Josephson plans to investigate powering the soil sensing system with &#8220;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/11/josephson-mud-batteries.html">mud batteries</a>,&#8221; microbial fuel cells that harness the energy of bacteria in the soil.<br/><br/>FFAR&#8217;s New Innovator in Food &amp; Agriculture Research Award provides early-career scientists with funding to conduct audacious food and agriculture research in one of their <a href="https://foundationfar.org/what-we-do/">Challenge Areas</a>, without the pressure of securing additional funding.&#160;<br/><br/>Josephson, whose award is $450,000, is one of ten innovators receiving a total of $8,950,028 over three years. Other innovators are studying challenges such as creating effective bee breeding strategies, developing climate-ready tree crops, and managing soilborne crop diseases.<br/><br/>&#8220;When scientists can spend less time searching for funding, that means more time for science,&#8221; said Saharah Moon Chapotin, FFAR executive director. &#8220;FFAR is proud to support these early career scientists as they pursue the creative research that will overcome current and future challenges to our agricultural and food systems.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b4241ffd80727046059835f2073f9dd8"><name>balto-sled-dog-genome</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Genome of famed sled dog Balto reveals genetic adaptations of working dogs</title><summary>Still a good boy nearly 100 years after historic sled run, Balto has now helped scientists explore the genetics of working dogs and demonstrate the power of comparative genomics.</summary><keywords>Beth Shapiro, Katherine Moon</keywords><start-date>1682618400000</start-date><display-name>Genome of famed sled dog Balto reveals genetic adaptations of working dogs</display-name><path>/2023/04/balto-sled-dog-genome</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/balto-sled-dog-genome</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1682354479082</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1682618357353</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/ancestry-illustration-600.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/ancestry-illustration-600.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ancestry-illustration-600.jpg</name><display-name>ancestry-illustration-600.jpg</display-name><file-size>77053</file-size><width>600</width><height>236</height></image><image-alt>illustration of Balto's ancestry</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/balto-kasson-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/balto-kasson-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>balto-kasson-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>balto-kasson-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15871</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Balto black and white photo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Alaskan sled dog Balto shared common ancestry with modern Asian and Arctic canine lineages.

Now, his DNA has enabled scientists to explore the genetics of 1920s sled dogs in Alaska and understand how they compare to modern dogs.</p>
<p>Scientists at UC Santa Cruz sequenced Balto&#8217;s genome as part of a large collaborative effort in comparative genomics leading to several papers published in the April 28 issue of <em>Science</em>. For the Balto study, the UCSC team extracted DNA from tissue samples of Balto&#8217;s taxidermied remains, provided by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and worked with colleagues at Cornell University and other institutions to investigate his ancestry and genetic traits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balto&#8217;s fame and the fact that he was taxidermied gave us this cool opportunity 100 years later to see what that population of sled dogs would have looked like genetically and to compare him to modern dogs,&#8221; said Katherine Moon, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the paper on the team&#8217;s findings <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn5887">published in <em>Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>The researchers found that Balto shared just part of his diverse ancestry with the Siberian husky breed. He belonged to a population of working sled dogs that were more genetically diverse than modern breeds and differed not only from today&#8217;s Siberian huskies but also from modern Alaskan sled dogs. The study found evidence that his population was genetically healthier than modern breeds and carried gene variants that may have helped the dogs survive their extreme environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balto came from a population of working dogs that were different from modern breeds and were adapted to harsh conditions,&#8221; said coauthor Beth Shapiro, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.</p>
<p>The analysis of Balto&#8217;s genome involved comparing it to a dataset of 682 genomes from modern dogs and wolves, as well as an alignment of 240 mammalian genomes developed by the Zoonomia Consortium, which was the foundation for most of the new comparative genomics studies published in the special issue of <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to take advantage of both the Zoonomia alignment and the huge amount of work that has gone into collecting the genomes of dogs,&#8221; said Shapiro, who is a member of the Zoonomia Consortium.</p>
<p>She explained that a key innovation behind these new studies is the ability to align the genomes of hundreds of species so that corresponding positions in different genomes can be compared. Comparative genomics can then reveal DNA sequences that are the same across species, having remained unchanged over millions of years of evolution&#8212;an indication that these are important parts of the genome where mutations could be harmful.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gene that&#8217;s on one chromosome in us is on a completely different chromosome in another species,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;You need a tool that can line them up so you can see which parts of these genomes are the same and which are different. Without that it&#8217;s just a bunch of genomes of species that are very divergent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/11/genome-alignments.html">genome alignment tool</a> that made this possible was developed by researchers at the <a href="https://genomics.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> led by Benedict Paten, professor of biomolecular engineering and a member of the Zoonomia Consortium. The new papers include a study that identified thousands of elements in the human genome that are highly conserved across species, and another showing how this information could make it easier to find genetic changes that increase disease risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we do genome sequencing of humans, it can be difficult to tell which genetic variants are significant,&#8221; explained Paten, who is a coauthor of both papers. &#8220;If it&#8217;s at a highly conserved site in the genome, that&#8217;s a good sign the variant may have functional effects and increase the risk of disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Balto paper also used this approach to characterize genetic variation in Balto compared to modern dogs. Balto and populations of working sled dogs had lower burdens of rare, potentially damaging variation than breed dogs, indicating they represent genetically healthier populations. The researchers also identified protein-altering, evolutionarily constrained variants in Balto in genes related to tissue development, which may represent beneficial adaptations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balto had variants in genes related to things like weight, coordination, joint formation, and skin thickness, which you would expect for a dog bred to run in that environment," Moon said.</p>
<p>Raised in the kennel of breeder Leonhard Seppala, Balto belonged to a population of small, fast sled dogs imported from Siberia that became known as Siberian huskies. The modern Siberian husky breed, however, is quite different from Balto and from modern sled dogs. In addition to Siberian huskies and Alaskan sled dogs, other living dog lineages that share common ancestry with Balto include Greenland sled dogs, Vietnamese village dogs, and Tibetan mastiffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really interesting to see the evolution of dogs like Balto, even in just the past 100 years,&#8221; Moon said. &#8220;Balto&#8217;s population was different from modern Siberian huskies, which have since been bred for a physical standard, but also from modern working Alaskan sled dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>One interesting trait identified in Balto&#8217;s genome is a better ability to digest starch compared to wolves and Greenland sled dogs (an isolated population), but not as good as modern dogs, which easily digest starchy foods.</p>
<p>Researchers were also able to use Balto&#8217;s genome to reconstruct his physical appearance, including his stature and coat color, in more detail than even historic photos could reveal.</p>
<p>&#8220;This project gives everyone an idea of what&#8217;s starting to be possible as more high-quality genomes become available to compare,&#8221; Moon said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an exciting moment because these are things we haven&#8217;t done before. I feel like an explorer, and once again Balto is leading the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another paper from Shapiro&#8217;s lab and the Zoonomia Consortium, in collaboration with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and other institutions, used genomics to predict which mammal species are more likely to face extinction. Genomic analysis can reveal evidence of inbreeding and other indicators of a population on the brink. Although ecological data provide the best predictors of extinction risk, genomics can help identify species that need more attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;In conservation, there are more species that need attention than we have time or resources to study, and it turns out that just having one good DNA sample can be enough for us to say either they&#8217;re probably alright, or now we need to focus on this species,&#8221; Shapiro said.</p>
<p>In addition to Moon and Shapiro, the coauthors of the Balto study include Heather Huson and Krishnamoorthy Srikanth at Cornell University; Kathleen Morrill, Xue Li, and Elinor Karlsson at UMass Chan Medical School; Ming-Shan Wang at UC Santa Cruz; Kerstin Lindblad-Toh at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT; Gavin Svenson at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History; and the Zoonomia Consortium. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Siberian Husky Club of America.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b4a1277680727046519e769e4bc52081"><name>peter-bratt-socialsciences</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Peter Bratt announced as 2023 Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award recipient</title><summary>Rockefeller Fellow, Peabody Award winner, Emmy-nominated film producer, writer, director, community organizer, and social justice activist Peter Bratt is UC Santa Cruz’s 2023 Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award recipient.</summary><start-date>1682355600000</start-date><display-name>peter-bratt-socialsciences</display-name><path>/2023/04/peter-bratt-socialsciences</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/peter-bratt-socialsciences</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1682362672992</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1683128553507</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/peter-bratt-headshot-400x400.png</path><link>site://news/2023/peter-bratt-headshot-400x400.png</link><site>news</site><name>peter-bratt-headshot-400x400.png</name><display-name>peter-bratt-headshot-400x400.png</display-name><file-size>211866</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/peter-bratt-headshotthumbnailpng.png</path><link>site://news/2023/peter-bratt-headshotthumbnailpng.png</link><site>news</site><name>peter-bratt-headshotthumbnailpng.png</name><display-name>peter-bratt-headshotthumbnailpng.png</display-name><file-size>16514</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Peter Bratt (Cowell &#8217;86, politics) is UCSC's 2023 Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni Award recipient</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/peter-bratt-white-house.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/peter-bratt-white-house.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-bratt-white-house.jpg</name><display-name>peter-bratt-white-house.jpg</display-name><file-size>106474</file-size><width>400</width><height>309</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><strong>From left to right:</strong> Peter Bratt, Abby Abinanti;

<h3><strong>Serving the community&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolores Huerta has played a part in Peter Bratt&#8217;s life since his childhood.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bratt&#8217;s mother was an organizer and an activist in the &#8216;60s and &#8216;70s and took part in movements including the Alcatraz Occupation of &#8216;69, the Wounded Knee stand-off, and the Farm Workers Movement. A young Bratt filed into the back of the family station wagon when it was time to protest and grew up around influential figures within his family and community. Bratt&#8217;s family often crossed paths with Dolores Huerta, who later became a friend and confidant.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when music icon Carlos Santana tapped Bratt to produce, write, and direct a feature film on Huerta&#8212;a woman who defined decades of tide-turning movements&#8212;he knew he couldn&#8217;t refuse.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOLORES</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> debuted in 2017 at the Sundance Film Festival and has won numerous awards, including a 2018 Peabody Award and a Critic&#8217;s Circle Award. The film featured big names, including Hillary Clinton and UCSC Professor Emerita Angela Davis. Bratt says his favorite part of filming </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOLORES</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was getting to know Huerta and her family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The heart and soul of the film are Dolores and her children,&#8221; Bratt said. &#8220;Their family story unfolds within the wider story of her evolution as a political thinker and movement builder. I interviewed all of her children and got to know them as a family. It took time to build trust, but once there was a relationship, they really opened up, shared their reflections, pains, and joys&#8212;and always kept it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real!&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dolores, who just turned 93, organizes every chance she gets. She is always in motion&#8212;and will be so until her last breath.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOLORES</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the third film Bratt produced after graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 1986.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1996, Peter released his first feature film, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow Me Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which premiered at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival and won the Best Feature Film Audience Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival. In 2009 he wrote, directed, and co-produced </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Mission</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which received the prestigious Norman Lear Writer&#8217;s Award at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, Peter was also the director and executive producer of ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Coraz&#243;n de Am&#233;rica,&#8221; the most widely watched episode of the network&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soul of a Nation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Building a community</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in San Francisco&#8217;s American Indian community, Bratt has turned his energies to&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lead The Village SF, a city-wide initiative that will provide access to health care and behavioral&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">health services, cultural resources, housing, an urban indigenous farm, and a place to thrive for&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the over 18,000 American Indians living in San Francisco.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today the majority of American Indians live in urban centers just like San Francisco, but remain largely invisible and underserved&#8221; Bratt says. &#8220;The Village SF will hopefully move us in a direction to change that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Village SF initiative has won considerable local, state, and federal support, including from former&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and San Francisco&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor London Breed.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, on April 21, 2023, Bratt and the Village SF team participated in a White House Environmental Justice Roundtable to discuss the challenges that many urban communities of color continue to face.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Village SF&#8212;in addition to providing critical social service support, also presents a holistic vision of environmental justice&#8221;, Bratt says, &#8220;one that is grounded in indigenous values and principles. Many of the systems, laws, policies and practices we live with today need to be reimagined, and indigenous values can help us do just that.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Attending UC Santa Cruz&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Bratt graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1986 with a B.A. in politics and a newfound love for filmmaking.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bratt said that, early in his college years, he had no interest in pursuing film, but thanks to a good friend from Merrill College, and a professor, Vivian Sobchack, Bratt quickly learned he had a new passion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I started to realize how so many of my perceptions of the world, of people, of whole groups, of gender and race were informed by the movies and television that I grew up watching and consuming,&#8221; Bratt said. &#8220;And after that, I realized that I wanted to tell stories.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what advice he&#8217;d offer current students at UC Santa Cruz, Bratt said he would council to not feel pressured to know what &#8220;you&#8217;re going to do for the rest of your life.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Entering as a freshman, I thought that I had to decide what I would be for the rest of my life, and whatever major I chose would determine my fate,&#8221; Bratt said. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s a lot of pressure to put on a young person. I had an amazing circle of friends that taught me that it was okay to take my time and explore. In fact, that&#8217;s how I discovered that I wanted to be a filmmaker.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/peter-bratt-featured.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/peter-bratt-featured.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-bratt-featured.jpg</name><display-name>peter-bratt-featured.jpg</display-name><file-size>26264</file-size><width>678</width><height>276</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Peter Bratt</thumb-alt><title>Peter Bratt: Championing underrepresented voices</title><description>Peter Bratt (Cowell ’86, politics)—Rockefeller Fellow; Peabody Award winner; Emmy-nominated film producer, writer, and director—was named UC Santa Cruz’s 2023 Social Sciences Distinguished Alumni award winner.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b50efdd680727046519e769eaf53b515"><name>sea-lion-size</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>As the California sea lion population got bigger, so did male sea lions</title><summary>Unlike other marine mammals, male California sea lions have gotten bigger over the past 50 years as their population has grown.</summary><keywords>Paul Koch, Ana Valenzuela-Toro, Dan Costa</keywords><start-date>1682607600000</start-date><display-name>As the California sea lion population got bigger, so did male sea lions</display-name><path>/2023/04/sea-lion-size</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/sea-lion-size</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1682369871298</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1682607939537</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value><value>StoryCruz</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/sea-lion-illustration-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/sea-lion-illustration-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sea-lion-illustration-500.jpg</name><display-name>sea-lion-illustration-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>73197</file-size><width>500</width><height>364</height></image><image-alt>California sea lions</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/sea-lion-illustration-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/sea-lion-illustration-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sea-lion-illustration-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sea-lion-illustration-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14136</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>illustration of two sea lions</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Male and female California sea lions differ substantially in body size and foraging behavior.

That&#8217;s not what has happened with California sea lions, however, according to a new study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00474-8">Published April 27 in <em>Current Biology</em></a>, the study found that male California sea lions have gotten bigger as the population grew over the past 50 years, while female body size has remained stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s counterintuitive. You would expect that their body size would decrease as dietary resource competition intensified,&#8221; said coauthor Paul Koch, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>The number of California sea lions has increased dramatically since the Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1972. In parts of their range, the sea lions may now be approaching the ecological &#8220;carrying capacity,&#8221; the largest number of animals an ecosystem can support.</p>
<p>In other marine mammal species, including northern fur seals, South American sea lions, and harbor seals, declines in adult body size have been observed as their population size increased, according to first author Ana Valenzuela-Toro. She led the study as a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, working with Koch and Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.</p>
<p>Valenzuela-Toro looked at the size and morphology of sea lion skulls collected between 1962 and 2008 in central California and now held at the California Academy of Sciences. She also analyzed bone samples for clues to changes in the animals&#8217; diets. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in bone samples can yield information about where in the ocean the animals were foraging and what kinds of prey they were eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that male California sea lions have expanded their ecological niche, which means they are now foraging on a more diversified group of prey and expanding the places where they are foraging," Valenzuela-Toro said. &#8220;Apparently they are now going farther north than they used to, which is consistent with observations reported by other researchers.&#8221;</p>
<p>By expanding the breadth of their diets, the sea lions have been able to get bigger even as their numbers increased. In theory, larger sea lions should be able to travel further, dive deeper, and handle larger prey. In addition, as their breeding sites became more crowded, increased competition between males during the breeding season may have favored larger males over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Body size is very important in competition with other males to control territory at breeding sites. Being bigger also means they can fast longer and stay on the beach to defend their territory,&#8221; Valenzuela-Toro said.</p>
<p>Male and female California sea lions differ substantially in body size and foraging behavior. The males generally congregate in colonies only during the breeding season, after which they leave on long foraging trips. Females, meanwhile, stay in the colony to give birth and nurse their pups, so their foraging is restricted to areas near the colony.</p>
<p>&#8220;This creates different selection pressures on females and males,&#8221; Valenzuela-Toro said.</p>
<p>She noted that prey was abundant during the period covered in this study. That may not continue to be the case in the future as marine ecosystems respond to a changing climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been a good period for sea lions, but if warm conditions become more frequent, we could see lower availability of their preferred prey, such as sardines and anchovies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Then we might see their population size start to plateau or decrease, and we could even see body size start to decline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Costa noted that the study was only possible because of the 167 California sea lion skulls collected over 44 years and maintained at the California Academy of Sciences. &#8220;These results are important to help us understand how marine mammals are adapting as their habitat changes in response to a changing climate,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Valenzuela-Toro, Costa, and Koch, the coauthors of the paper include Rita Mehta at UC Santa Cruz and Nicholas Pyenson at the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s National Museum of Natural History.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b8b187fc80727046519e769e0d5b8958"><name>vcr-finalists</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Visits set for Vice Chancellor for Research finalists</title><summary>Beginning May 1 and continuing through May 11, the UC Santa Cruz community will have the opportunity to meet, hear from, and ask questions of the finalists for Vice Chancellor for Research.</summary><start-date>1682406000000</start-date><path>/2023/04/vcr-finalists</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/vcr-finalists</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1682430855146</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1682430855146</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning May 1 and continuing through May 11, the UC Santa Cruz community will have the opportunity to meet, hear from, and ask questions of the finalists for Vice Chancellor for Research (VCR).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many of our financial aid&#8211;eligible students already enroll in 10 credits to qualify for the generous Summer University Grant, &#8220; said Richard Hughey, Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement. &#8220;With this new option, they can add additional courses at no additional tuition cost. We hope to increase summer affordability, including allowing more students to live on campus to make degree progress.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC students can get a </span><a href="https://financialaid.ucsc.edu/cost-to-attend/summer-students/summer-costs-grant-estimates.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summer grant estimate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the Financial Aid and Scholarships website.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pay for 10 program includes in-person and online classes, as well as independent studies that include summer tuition. Online instruction continues to be a popular and flexible option for students, who can enroll in everything from math to music. The Pay for 10 program is extended to UC students who wish to join our Banana Slug community as summer-only students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With smaller class sizes and bigger savings, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC students can make this summer sizzle&#8212;by spending it getting closer to their degree.</span></p>

<p>In an effort to promote openness related to our drinking water and provide assurance that it continues to meet or exceed state and federal quality standards, I am pleased to share that we will begin a new annual testing program to verify our water quality.</p>
<p>The City of Santa Cruz provides and tests our drinking water, and publishes an <a href="https://www.cityofsantacruz.com/government/city-departments/water/water-quality">annual report</a> about its work. While our residential campus does not have lead pipes in its water delivery system, it is possible for water that sits for long periods in non-lead pipes to absorb contaminants. As a way to confirm confidence in the quality of our drinking water, later this year we will begin testing drinking fountains, water refilling stations, faucets and other water sources at UC Santa Cruz facilities. If tests reveal any concerns, we will immediately take appropriate action. In any case, we will share the results of all testing.</p>
<p>Information on the water quality testing program and its results will be available on the <a href="https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/environmental/drinking-water.html">Environmental Health and Safety website</a>.</p>
<p>We want our community members to feel confident that the drinking water on campus continues to be safe. This new testing and information sharing program will help support and sustain that confidence.</p>
<p>Sincerely, <br/>Ed</p>
<p>Ed Reiskin<br/>Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations, and Administration</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="baa0392080727046169e92b04efd0447"><name>andrew-guydish</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Enhancing communication across communities</title><summary>UCSC Ph.D. candidate Andrew Guydish pursues psychology and conversational dynamics with the help of the Fredrico and Rena Perlino Memorial Scholarship</summary><start-date>1682492400000</start-date><display-name>andrew-guydish</display-name><path>/2023/04/andrew-guydish</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/andrew-guydish</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1682463275276</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684427902429</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bayan Parrenas Shimizu</name><title></title><phone/><email>bpshimiz@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/andrew-guydish-.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/andrew-guydish-.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>andrew-guydish-.jpg</name><display-name>andrew-guydish-.jpg</display-name><file-size>236253</file-size><width>450</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/andrew-guydish-80x.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/andrew-guydish-80x.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>andrew-guydish-80x.jpg</name><display-name>andrew-guydish-80x.jpg</display-name><file-size>21572</file-size><width>80</width><height>120</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Andrew Guydish&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">(Crown &#8216;16, cognitive science, M.S. psychology, Ph.D. psychology)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Ph.D. candidate Andrew Guydish awarded the Fredrico and Rena Perlino Memorial Scholarship</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Santa Cruz County native, Andrew Guydish (Crown &#8216;16, cognitive science, M.S. psychology, Ph.D. psychology) always viewed UC Santa Cruz as the perfect place to earn his undergraduate and graduate degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guydish received his BA in cognitive science in 2016 and then pursued a MA in research and experimental psychology from San Jose State University. Afterward, he returned to UCSC to earn an MS in psychology. After years of study, Guydish was awarded the Fredrico and Rena Perlino Memorial Scholarship at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fredrico and Rena Perlino Memorial Scholarship honors and supports students working towards enhancing communications across communities including deaf and mute populations. The scholarship is supported by the late Fredrico and Rena Perlino, whose estate supports the Santa Cruz community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A graduate student researcher in psychology, Guydish works to understand communication. His current focus is on conversational dynamics. Thanks to the support from the Fredrico and Rena Perlino Memorial Scholarship, Guydish can take his research in new directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In previous work, I&#8217;ve shown some pretty awesome effects, and this work is a follow up to those previous studies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about the potential results, and the Fredrico and Rena Memorial Scholarship will allow me to pursue those ends with peace of mind!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guydish currently works in spontaneous communications under Dr. Jean E. Fox Tree, and hopes to become a professor after earning his Ph.D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guydish&#8217;s knowledge of psychology has been especially valuable during the massive cultural shift caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Guydish served as a reference for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;s and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Telegraph</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;s coverage of how quarantines and remote communication changed our understanding and the function of conversations. He continues to investigate the big question of conversation in his research at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What makes you leave a conversation saying &#8220;that was a great conversation&#8221; versus &#8220;that was a bad conversation&#8221;? I&#8217;m trying to find out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guydish hopes current students will take the opportunity to truly dive into Santa Cruz&#8217;s unique landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Immerse yourself in the campus culture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have some of the best, nicest, and smartest people in all areas working here at UC Santa Cruz. In addition, we have a gorgeous campus which makes attending school here a whole different experience compared to elsewhere.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="be33a9a480727046169e92b0aa7c5d08"><name>csc-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC Chemical Screening Center symposium features drug discovery talks</title><summary>The center will hold a Grand Reopening Celebration and Research Symposium on Friday, May 5, marking a major upgrade with new state-of-the-art equipment.</summary><keywords>Scott Lokey</keywords><start-date>1682492400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC Chemical Screening Center symposium features drug discovery talks</display-name><path>/2023/04/csc-symposium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/csc-symposium</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1682523269517</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1682523655294</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/csc-confocal-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/csc-confocal-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>csc-confocal-500.jpg</name><display-name>csc-confocal-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>112280</file-size><width>500</width><height>327</height></image><image-alt>two scientists looking at images of cells</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/csc-confocal-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/csc-confocal-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>csc-confocal-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>csc-confocal-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25340</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>woman in lab coat</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>The Chemical Screening Center&#8217;s new equipment includes an extremely fast high-resolution confocal microscope to acquire high-content image data for rapid screening of live cells.

(Photo by Elena Zhukova)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>The center will hold a Grand Reopening Celebration and Research Symposium on Friday, May 5, marking a major upgrade with new state-of-the-art equipment</article-subhead><article-text><p>Since 2007, the UC Santa Cruz Chemical Screening Center has been an important campus facility both for basic science research and for drug discovery efforts to find new compounds for therapeutic uses. Over the past two years, with major funding from the National Institutes of Health, the center has installed new state-of-the-art equipment, substantially increasing its screening capabilities and level of automation.</p>
<p>The revamped facilities of the UCSC Chemical Screening Center will be highlighted at the center&#8217;s <a href="https://csc.ucsc.edu/2023/02/21/save-the-date/">Grand Reopening Celebration and Research Symposium</a> on Friday, May 5, at the University Center.</p>
<p>The keynote speakers will be <strong>Maureen Hillenmeyer</strong>, founder and CEO of the biotechnology company Hexagon Bio, and <strong>Michelle Arkin</strong>, distinguished professor and chair of pharmaceutical chemistry at UC San Francisco and director of the UCSF Small Molecule Discovery Center. The event will also include talks and poster presentations by UCSC faculty, staff scientists, postdocs, and students who are using the facility in their research.</p>
<p>&#8220;With all the new equipment installed and research activity ramping up, it&#8217;s a perfect time to mark the beginning of a new phase for the Chemical Screening Center,&#8221; said Scott Lokey, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and faculty director of the center. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be able to hear from people who are using it and getting new results.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the upgrade, the center moved to a new, larger space on the fourth floor of the Physical Sciences Building. The new infrastructure includes high-end robotic equipment for liquid handling and high-throughput sample processing, and an extremely fast high-resolution confocal microscope to acquire high-content image data for rapid screening of live cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can screen up to 200,000 samples per day, and the confocal microscope is so fast it can collect terabytes of image data per day,&#8221; said Beverley Rabbitts, the center&#8217;s director of operations.</p>
<p>Using specialized bioinformatics software to analyze the image data, researchers can screen thousands of compounds to detect subtle effects on cells and identify mechanisms of action that could lead to the development of a new drug.</p>
<p>In addition to the $2 million NIH instrumentation grant, the UCSC campus provided $100,000 for the purchase of new libraries of chemical compounds for screening, including a library of 64,000 synthetic molecules selected for chemical diversity and drug-like properties. The center also provides access to libraries developed at UCSC that are available nowhere else, including Lokey&#8217;s library of cyclic peptides and libraries of complex natural products isolated by the laboratories of Professors Phil Crews and John MacMillan.</p>
<p>Another powerful library of more than 8,000 bioactive compounds includes drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of interest in repurposing existing drugs, so you can screen these compounds against a cancer cell line, for example, and if you find a hit you don&#8217;t have to go through all the clinical development that would be required for a new compound,&#8221; Lokey explained.</p>
<p>Rabbitts provides one-on-one training for students and other new users of the center&#8217;s facilities. Lokey said the focus on training sets the UCSC center apart from other screening centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s valuable experience for the students, and the symposium will give them an opportunity to showcase what they&#8217;ve been doing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Support for the symposium is provided by industry sponsors PerkinElmer and Agilent BioTek, and by the UCSC Office of Research, Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, and the Biomolecular Engineering Department within Baskin Engineering.</p>

<p>A new study, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217909120">published April 26 in <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>, quantifies key aspects of the biological processes that influence the Southern Ocean carbon sink. The &#8220;biological pump,&#8221; where carbon is used by organisms at the surface and transferred to ocean depths, away from contact with the atmosphere, is a critical process in ocean carbon cycling.</p>
<p>First author Yibin Huang worked on the study as a postdoctoral researcher in ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, together with corresponding author Andrea Fassbender, a research scientist at NOAA&#8217;s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and adjunct professor of ocean sciences at UCSC, and coauthor Seth Bushinsky at the University of Hawaii at M&#257;noa.</p>
<p>The researchers examined data collected from more than 60 autonomous profiling floats over 10 years to quantify for the first time the role that tiny phytoplankton play through their creation of different types of biogenic carbon. Each type of biogenic carbon has a different impact on carbon export and on the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and ocean.</p>
<p>Understanding the Southern Ocean&#8217;s carbon cycle is critically important because a change in the rate at which biogenic carbon is stored in ocean waters could result in more carbon dioxide remaining in the atmosphere, which could potentially affect the rate of climate change.</p>
<p>Huang, now at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, said that simultaneously monitoring the three different types of carbon produced by biological activity has posed a longstanding problem for oceanographers. The three types of carbon&#8212;particulate inorganic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon&#8212;interact in a complex set of balancing relationships that determine how much carbon is absorbed by the ocean and how much is released to the atmosphere. Due to the complexity of traditional methods of measuring the amount of carbon exchanged between types of carbon over a specified time, he said, scientists have tended to treat the total carbon production as a black box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study applies a recently developed method for estimating the production and export of distinct biogenic carbon pools in a cost-effective way and at ocean basin scales to monitor how marine ecosystems function and their response to future climate change,&#8221; Huang said.</p>
<p>In the Southern Ocean below 35&#176; south latitude, the interaction of physical and biological processes shapes regional biogeochemistry and influences the global ocean interior. Prevailing upwelling south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current brings deep waters rich in dissolved inorganic carbon into contact with the atmosphere. The deep waters are also rich in nutrients, which fuel biological activity that peaks during spring and summer. Phytoplankton consume dissolved inorganic carbon, with some species using it to make their exoskeletons, and subsequently transport it to depth when they die.</p>
<p>While plankton flourish in this rich, cold water, they can&#8217;t fully use available nutrients and the dissolved inorganic carbon brought to the surface during upwelling. Some of the dissolved inorganic carbon is outgassed to the atmosphere locally. The unused nutrients are subsequently transported toward the equator via large-scale ocean circulation, fueling a large fraction of the biological production in the subtropics and tropics. The seasonal pattern of carbon cycling in the Southern Ocean is also shaped by the slowdown in phytoplankton growth during the winter.</p>
<p>The new paper focuses on quantifying the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon used by these tiny organisms, and how the natural process of carbon export influences the modern air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>The researchers found that organic carbon production captures roughly 3 billion tons of carbon per year, which is equivalent to about one quarter of total human emissions, while particulate inorganic carbon production diminishes carbon dioxide uptake by about 270 million tons per year. Differences in the amount of each type of carbon produced from north to south across the Southern Ocean influence how the biological pump impacts local air-sea carbon dioxide exchange.</p>
<p>If the amount of carbon fixed by these phytoplankton decreased by 30%, the Southern Ocean would release carbon dioxide instead of absorbing it, the scientists said.</p>
<p>The significant role played by phytoplankton in the modern Southern Ocean carbon sink suggests that understanding year-to-year variability in biogenic carbon production is key to understanding the overall Southern Ocean carbon sink, Fassbender said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expanding persistent year-round observations from biogeochemical profiling floats would serve as a cost-effective way to monitor the biological pump throughout the Southern Ocean and globally,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The study was primarily supported by a National Science Foundation grant at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bf389f5b807270461b6dfc92d3ae32d6"><name>salary-increase</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Anticipated salary increase policy-covered staff, academic appointees</title><summary>We are pleased to share the news from the UC Office of the President that for the second year in a row, all eligible policy-covered staff employees, senate faculty and policy-covered academic appointees will receive a salary increase, pending approval of the state budget.</summary><start-date>1682492400000</start-date><display-name>Anticipated salary increase policy-covered staff, academic appointees</display-name><path>/2023/04/salary-increase</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/salary-increase</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1682540371777</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1682540371777</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The staff and faculty of UC Santa Cruz play a vital role in furthering our mission and goals, supporting our students and preparing them to succeed in their chosen fields. Each day, your commitment to our campus strengthens our progress toward building an inclusive university centered on student-centered learning, world-class research and creative scholarship and service.</span></p>
<p><span>We are pleased to share the news from the UC Office of the President that for the second year in a row, all eligible policy-covered staff employees, senate faculty and policy-covered academic appointees will receive a salary increase, pending approval of the state budget and the University of California receiving its full state funding. The University of California anticipates eligible employees could receive an increase of up to 4.6 percent.</span></p>
<p><span>If approved by the state legislature, the increase to the base salary of eligible staff employees will be effective July 1, 2023, for monthly paid employees and June 25, 2023, for bi-weekly paid employees. Monthly employees should see the increase on their August 1, 2023 paycheck, and bi-weekly employees should see the increase on their July 19, 2023 paycheck.</span></p>
<p><span>For senate faculty and academic appointees, the increase is a general range adjustment and will be effective October 1, 2023, for policy-covered faculty and July 1, 2023, for other policy-covered academic appointees. The regular peer-review merit advancement process for policy-covered academic appointees will continue per academic personnel policy.</span></p>
<p><span>The wages for staff employees and academic appointees represented by unions are governed by collective bargaining agreements and not included in this program.</span></p>
<p><span>While the UC Office of the President does not anticipate a change, in the event the current budget expectations are altered, UC President Michael Drake will provide an updated announcement at that time.</span></p>
<p><span>We are pleased that the contributions of our staff and faculty members to UC Santa Cruz and beyond are being acknowledged by the University of California. More details regarding eligibility and any updates to pay dates will be communicated as details become available.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Staff equity program update</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In fall 2021, we launched the Staff Equity Program. The three-year effort is designed to increase our actual pay levels and targets employees in lower salary grades whose salaries are furthest below market. The goal of the $5.5 million program is to make our pay practices more competitive and provide an incentive for staff to continue their careers at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span>During the program's first year, the salaries of more than 1,300 policy-covered employees were increased. Seventy-one percent of the increases went to employees at or below the 25th percentile. Salary increases ranged from less than 1 percent to 6 percent, with an average increase of 2.46 percent, translating to an average annual salary increase of $1,841.</span></p>
<p><span>In the program&#8217;s second year, 49 percent of the $1.5 million in salary increases went to employees earning at or below the 25th percentile and 42 percent went to employees earning above the 25th percentile and below the 42nd percentile. Approximately 95% of the $1.5 million was distributed to employees in grades 15 through 25. Details on salary increases in the third year will be shared in the 2023-24 academic year.</span></p>
<p><span>The overall impact of the program, along with the general increases and individual equity increases provided by departments, has shifted our salary distribution closer to an ideal distribution that aligns salaries at UC Santa Cruz with the labor market (50th percentile).</span></p>
<p><span>We are grateful for all you do.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff</audience><admin>Cindy Larive Chancellor and  Lori Kletzer Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4975de58072704658edeaa4df5eedb5"><name>sab-election-results</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Announcing the SAB Election Results</title><summary>The Staff Advisory Board is excited to admit seven campus staff to the Staff Advisory Board.</summary><start-date>1682578800000</start-date><display-name>Announcing the SAB Election Results</display-name><path>/2023/04/sab-election-results</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/sab-election-results</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1682630467025</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1682630576370</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The Staff Advisory Board is excited to admit seven campus staff to the Staff Advisory Board!</span></p>
<p><br/><span>Each year, the Staff Advisory Board has members who reach the end of their term of service, which opens up seats in our membership for new staff to join us. So, if you&#8217;re ever interested in working hard to advocate for the staff voice in leadership spaces, you can nominate yourself during our annual election process&#8230; as did several people this year.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, special for this year, the SAB voted to increase our membership by three new seats in order to serve the campus more fully.</span></p>
<p><br/><span>With the combination of members terming out and new seats being added, the number of nominations matched the number of open seats on the board. Therefore, we won&#8217;t need to run an election this year.</span></p>
<p><span>Please read on below to learn more about the people joining the board. These members will officially join the board in July 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you,</span> <br/><span>Your Staff Advisory Board</span></p>
<p><br/><span><strong>Meg Lehr <br/><em>Divisional Resources Manager</em> </strong></span><br/><span>UCSC is an amazing place to work, from our core missions of education and research that better the world we live in to the amazingly dedicated and smart staff. I've held various positions in the areas of academic planning and academic operations, working with staff in student-facing front-line units (like colleges and academic departments) to the more foundational business and operational units (like Financial Affairs, Budget Analysis and Planning, PPDO, ITS). I have become convinced that when we collaborate and work together on solutions, we can produce the best outcomes. I want to bring my experience working beyond the boundary of my unit and knowledge of how things work to the SAB to help effect positive change.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>David Hunt <br/><em>Wireless Network Engineer</em> </strong></span><br/><span>I am very interested in becoming an active member to give back, it is so exciting to be part of UCSC.&#160; My family, both my mother and father have been residents of Santa Cruz for over 100 years and UCSC represents the future of the community I love so much.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Christopher Burgess <br/><em>Assistant Registrar</em> </strong></span><br/><span>Thank you for your consideration in the election for the SAB! I would be honored to serve and listen to the needs of fellow UCSC staff.</span></p>
<p><span>I work in the Office of the Registrar as an Assistant Registrar for Records and Enrollment. Much of this work entails dealing with difficult and sensitive situations that require problem solving, listening skills, collaboration, and empathy. I would bring these same skills to the SAB and would work to be a resource to staff.</span></p>
<p><span>Engagement and support of employees is vital to the success of any organization. I have worked in various similar capacities at both public and private organizations and would bring this experience and personal skill set to the SAB.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your consideration!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lea Taddonio (Lee-ah Tah-doh-knee-oh) <br/><em>Coordinator of Residential Education: Family Student Housing</em> </strong></span><br/><span>Hello! My name is Lea (she/her) and I&#8217;ve worked at UCSC since April 2019 in a variety of departments from Conference Services, to College Student Life, to Career Success, and now Affiliated Residential Campus Housing. I hold a M.A in Community Development, have traveled to every continent except Asia (I&#8217;m visiting Seoul in the fall), love seeing live music, have three kids at three different schools here in town, and a very talkative dog and cat. To say the last few years have been tough is profound understatement, but I feel as if it&#8217;s led us to a transformative moment on a collective and individual scale. I&#8217;m interested in serving on SAB to advocate and advance a culture of collective care, centering basic needs, normalizing relational pauses, and ensuring our university-wide commitment to being celebrative is authentically honoring the dedication and labor of our staff. Additionally, I feel a deep responsibility as a white person to actively dismantle the unjust structures from which white folks have benefitted for so long&#8212;including within this institution. Thanks so much for your consideration.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lauren Morgan <br/><em>Senior Leader HR Manager</em> </strong></span><br/><span>I have been working with the SAB since I started my job in August of 2018. One of my duties is to be the staff person for the senior leader search committees. I have found the SAB to be an engaged group to work with, with a passion for UCSC and I would like to be a part of that. I have built relationships with all of the senior leaders and think I could be a good advocate for the SAB. I also have a daughter at UCSC who is a graduating senior, which has given me a different perspective and fondness for the campus. I would appreciate your support for me.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Fisher Dietz <br/><em>Academic Computing Expert</em> </strong></span><br/><span>My name is Fisher Dietz. I&#8217;m a young student of the world who strives to open my mind and see new perspectives. Always looking for opportunities to take part in my community I am excited at the prospect of becoming a member of the SAB.</span></p>
<p><span>Growing up in the mountains outside of Yosemite, I learned my love for nature and how important it is that we care for it. As I grew older I discovered an interest in taking computer equipment apart and using the components in new ways. These passions led to my interest in using technology to create more harmony between nature and humanity. Eventually landing at a nature and harmony focused university, UC Merced, earning my computer science degree.</span></p>
<p><span>While attending I worked in the then new WAVE Lab, a virtual reality lab that focused on preserving at risk heritage sites, both natural and man made. Allowing me to go out into the field and use experimental equipment to capture sites from never before seen perspectives. This gave me a foundation where I could see my passion applied to real world situations with positive results.</span></p>
<p><span>Not long after my graduation the pandemic started. Like much of the world, I struggled. Suddenly trips to nature became discouraged, but I also witnessed a time where humans were forced inside, and how positively the environment reacted, reminding me of my life ambition to work with the planet.</span></p>
<p><span>I applied to UCSC with the campus&#8217;s connection and commitment to the natural landscape surrounding the campus, as well as the nearby coastline in mind. During my employment I have also fallen in with the staff members and their eagerness to help when and where they can.</span></p>
<p><span>If I get elected to the board I hope to offer new perspectives, as well as an understanding of sometimes forgotten locations that are part of UCSC, such as the Silicon Valley Campus where I provide IT support to the students and staff of Baskin Engineering. While at the same time learning about the big decision making process employed at this university.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Liz Moya <br/><em>Renaissance Scholars Program Counselor <br/>Liz will be returning for her second term on SAB </em></strong></span><br/><span>As the Renaissance Scholars Program Counselor, I advocate and work alongside with students who identify as current/former foster youth, healing from childhood trauma and other extenuating adverse lived experiences. This work is deeply personal to me since I am also an alum from this program when I was attending UC Santa Cruz, class of 2013. I help my students with short and long term goals and holistic advising with a focus on mental health and well-being. This work also translates into my role on the Staff Advisory Board. I have a deep passion and commitment of how I would like to bring more mental health and community care resources to our campus for staff and faculty. I am also a mother to my beautiful son and we enjoy camping, traveling and watching movies together.</span> <br/>&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Staff Advisory Board</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c95c72498072704658edeaa426d9f034"><name>paul-roth-fulbright</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Fulbright scholarship will bring distinguished philosophy professor Paul Roth to Manchester, England this winter</title><summary>Paul Roth, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Philosophy, has been awarded a Fulbright Distinguished Scholar Fellowship—the most distinguished appointment in the Fulbright program.

He will be at the University of Manchester for six months starting January 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;The award is a great honor since it provides acknowledgement of the work that I have been doing for many years,&#8221; Roth said this week. The Fulbright Distinguished Scholar awards offer a unique opportunity to work closely with other researchers in one&#8217;s field.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two fields of interest&#8212;historical explanation and the history of analytic philosophy&#8212;are not widely taught in the US,&#8221; Roth said.</p>
<p>In studying at the University of Manchester, Roth is also embodying one of his core beliefs&#8212;that scholars should spend a semester or quarter at a different university if it provides special opportunities for study.</p>
<p>Roth will work with Professor Frederique Janssen-Lauret, a philosophical logician and historian of logic and analytic philosophy at the University of Manchester.</p>
<p>A very important but little-studied aspect in the history of analytic philosophy concerns how the conception of logic evolved in the 20th century, and the important changes in scientific explanation that came along with that evolution.</p>
<p>Roth&#8217;s project, &#8220;The Logic of History and the History of Logic&#8221; will look at this juncture of how formal models of reasoning relate to how we understand the natural world as well as our own history. This will broaden and develop themes that he explores in his 2020 book, The Philosophical Structure of Historical Explanation.</p>
<p>Knowing that he&#8217;s heading to Manchester soon, Roth is also preparing by becoming more knowledgeable about Premier League Soccer. &#8220;Manchester boasts two famous teams&#8212;Manchester United and Manchester City,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;Hence, I plan to binge-watch "Ted Lasso&#8221; (a TV show about an underdog soccer team) before I leave.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ca3ea51b80727046312fc81120f14a29"><name>confronting-climate-change-2023</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Annual climate change event takes aim at heat and human health for 2023</title><summary>The ninth annual Confronting Climate Change event gathered top scholars to discuss the health impacts of climate change and the social and economic transformations needed to address them. </summary><start-date>1681714800000</start-date><path>/2023/04/confronting-climate-change-2023</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/confronting-climate-change-2023</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1682725315848</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1682726475578</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Allison Arteaga Soergel</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption>Recording of the 2023 Confronting Climate Change event</caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/climate-panel-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/climate-panel-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>climate-panel-400.jpg</name><display-name>climate-panel-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>63431</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Panelists and moderator seated on stage in front of the audience</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/climate-panel-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/climate-panel-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>climate-panel-80.jpg</name><display-name>climate-panel-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>22296</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Panelists and moderator seated on stage in front of the audience</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>From left to right: Confronting Climate Change 2023 event moderator, Andrew Mathews, and speakers Matthew Huber,&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Livingston, and&#160;Bharat Jayram Venkat.&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ninth annual Confronting Climate Change event, &#8220;Heat! Climate Change and Human Health,&#8221; gathered top scholars at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on April 13 to discuss the health impacts of climate change and the social and economic transformations needed to address them. The event was live-streamed for members of the public.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://confrontingclimatechange.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confronting Climate Change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is hosted each year by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Division of Social Sciences and Division of Physical and Biological Sciences to provide an interdisciplinary deep-dive into climate change issues. Acting Dean of Social Sciences Heather Bullock described this year&#8217;s focus in her opening remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tonight, we will examine the increasing impact of climate change on human health&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and how we can respond to these challenges with creativity, compassion, and a commitment to social justice,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Professor Andrew Mathews&#8212;an environmental anthropologist&#8212;introduced the night&#8217;s three main speakers and then moderated a discussion among them. The first speaker was Professor Matthew Huber, director of The Institute for a Sustainable Future at Purdue University, who holds a doctoral degree from UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huber&#8217;s research focuses on climate modeling and heat stress, and he explained how the number of days with potentially deadly &#8220;wet bulb&#8221; temperatures would increase under different emissions scenarios. Under high emissions scenarios, he showed how the human health and economic impacts could be both dire and inequitably distributed. And he called for urgent action to reduce emissions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Any one of these [emissions scenarios] is a possible future, and it's our decisions that are going to decide which of those paths we&#8217;re on,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second speaker was New York University Professor Julie Livingston, who discussed how climate change and related disasters increase rates of suicide and mental health issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At its largest scale, climate change is a gross act of collective murder-suicide unfolding in broad daylight, orchestrated and furthered by powerful interests,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livingston also discussed how efforts to medicate ourselves out of this crisis&#8212;without addressing the systemic roots of the problem&#8212;can cause other forms of environmental harm, as psychotropic drugs enter our wastewater in increasing amounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next speaker was Assistant Professor Bharat Jayram Venkat, who leads the UCLA Heat Lab, where researchers are engaged in an interdisciplinary effort to study the experience of what he calls &#8220;thermal inequality.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our aim in the lab is to understand how certain kinds of people and certain kinds of bodies and communities have been actively made more vulnerable to the effects of heat,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venkat shared historical and modern examples from around the globe of how the experience of heat is racialized, with people of color having the most heat exposure in their occupations and through the built environment of their homes and communities. He traced these effects back to the legacies of racism and colonialism and emphasized that &#8220;thermal comfort for some is purchased at the expense of others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the panel portion of the evening, the speakers discussed ways that our communities might adapt to extreme heat, including tree cover and shade structures, the pros and cons of air conditioning, and the need to ensure access to safe, stable housing. They also discussed how climate change demonstrates the complex interconnectedness of health, environmental issues, and social and economic systems. Ultimately, panelists agreed that tackling the effects of heat on human health will call for an integrated approach.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Koch, dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, gave closing remarks for the event and invited the audience to continue thinking and learning about climate change.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d7c38fd8807270462f8406701a8434dd"><name>rejecting-hate</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Rejecting hate on our campus</title><summary>We unequivocally condemn these – and all – antisemitic and anti-LGBTQIA+ actions.</summary><start-date>1682838000000</start-date><display-name>Rejecting hate on our campus</display-name><path>/2023/04/rejecting-hate</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/04/rejecting-hate</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1682952130503</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1683304929873</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/04/images/sign-80px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/04/images/sign-80px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sign-80px.jpg</name><display-name>sign-80px.jpg</display-name><file-size>13531</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of wood sign at campus entrance</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>This week, we received two separate reports of antisemitism and hate on and near our campus. The first reported incident took place on campus last Thursday, April 20. A group of students reportedly gathered to celebrate Adolf Hitler&#8217;s birthday. They sang happy birthday and ate cakes adorned with hateful and horrific symbols. The second reported incident took place in downtown Santa Cruz last Friday. A student found an antisemitic and anti-LGBTQIA+ flyer on their car&#8217;s windshield. The flyer included despicable and degrading claims about Jewish people and LGBTQIA+ people. </span></p>
<p><span>We unequivocally condemn these &#8211; and all &#8211; antisemitic and anti-LGBTQIA+ actions. They are at odds with our </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1683037274111000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OjZMQxXTmYXahATQ2qlkl" href="https://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Principles of Community</span></a></span><span> and, as such, will be addressed accordingly. The on-campus incident has been referred to student conduct for follow up and adjudication. Likewise, we are reaching out to Santa Cruz city officials to ask for their support and collaboration to address the concerning flyers reported downtown. These disturbing incidents follow a national trend of increased antisemitic rhetoric and violence. Whatever the purpose and wherever they take place, we reject any and all acts of antisemitism. Our Jewish community members and our LGBTQIA+ community members are an integral part of our Banana Slug family, and we stand with them against all such acts of hate.</span></p>
<p><span>White supremacy has no place at UC Santa Cruz. Nor does any action intended to degrade, dehumanize, or intimidate another based on identity. We will not tolerate such vitriol; nor will we abide the fear and terror it intends to inspire. United by our shared sense of humanity, we must strive to be a welcoming place for all people. Together, we must continue to reject all expressions of hate. </span></p>
<p><span>Incidents like this can be painful and cause increased worry, fear, and anger. We encourage our community to reach out for support.
