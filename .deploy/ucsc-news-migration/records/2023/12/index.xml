</article-subhead><article-text><p>Today, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced funding for an Indigenous Data Repository led by Native scientists to help improve health in tribal communities and for all Indigenous Peoples. After a competitive review, Stanford University in collaboration with the&#160;<a href="https://nativebio.org/">Native BioData Consortium</a> (NativeBio) was awarded $9 million to fund an Indigenous-led effort called &#8220;Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Tribal Data Repository (RADx TDR): Data for Indigenous Implementations, Interventions, and Innovations (D4I).&#8221; UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) is a sub-awardee of this grant.<br/><br/>The NativeBio is the first Indigenous-led, 501(c)(3) nonprofit biodata repository and research institution in the geographic borders and legal jurisdiction of a Tribal Nation, the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. NativeBio will work with five scholars at premier research universities and at 10 health sites using American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) public health data to help design ethical approaches to data sharing, data analysis, implementation, policy, and legal frameworks. The goal is to more immediately serve Tribal populations following the disproportional impact of COVID-19 in Indigenous communities.<br/><br/>The award is a landmark decision in support of Indigenous Peoples.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;In recognition that science development projects are increasingly done as public-private partnerships, we recommend that formal and informal standards include and adhere to 21st century precepts of equity, restorative justice, and benefit sharing, acknowledging the 532 years of injustice done to Native Americans and their inability to correct the problem on their own,&#8221; said Joseph Yracheta (P&#363;repecha), executive director of NativeBio.<br/><br/>The RADx Tribal Data Repository comes in response to the NIH initiative, called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics for Underserved Populations (RADx&#174;-UP), launched during the COVID-19 pandemic to &#8220;speed innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of technologies for COVID-19 testing.&#8221; RADx-UP enabled a targeted public health response to COVID-19 and helped to identify and address disparities in COVID-19 diagnostic testing and effectiveness among underserved and vulnerable populations. AI/AN communities acutely felt the devastating consequences of COVID-19, partly due to the increased prevalence of underlying chronic conditions caused by systemic neglect and underfunding of tribal health services.<br/><br/>&#8220;Though apparent, the true extent of COVID-19 disparities among Indigenous Peoples is likely underestimated,&#8221; Yracheta said. &#8220;This is mostly because of underreporting in the absence of a unified, Indigenous-led data resource to facilitate data collection, interagency cooperation, guide COVID-19 research, and subsequent implementations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full RADX Tribal Data Repository team includes Stanford University as the prime awardee and project administrator and Native Bio as the project leader. The project will be guided by NativeBio consortium members from UC Santa Cruz, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, The Ohio State University, Arizona State University, and the University of Washington-Seattle.&#160;<br/><br/>UCSC Genomics Institute Assistant Researcher Ann Mc Cartney will work alongside the Indigenous leaders on this project.&#160;<br/><br/>Working alongside the principal investigators and advisors from Tribal communities, Mc Cartney will use her expertise in genomics data management and ethics to help to develop a Indigenous Data Sovereignty framework to guide culturally responsive access to, and use of, Tribal data. The team will strive to safeguard and respect the sovereignty and diversity of participating Tribes, facilitate responsible, ethical, and legal data transfer, and ensure that the full scientific potential of the data can be realized.<br/><br/>&#8220;Establishing the TDR at the NBDC is a transformative change toward building a more just and equitable future for scientific research in the United States,&#8221; Mc Cartney said. &#8220;As an Indigenous-governed repository built upon Indigenous ethical frameworks, the TDR provides a safe home for Tribal data. A home that is responsive and accountable to Indian Country. A home that upholds Tribal rights and values such as respect, trust, transparency, accountability, integrity and sustainability across all of its practices, processes and policies. The TDR is exciting &#8212; it will provide a space that facilitates Indigenous innovation and creativity and set a precedent for Tribal data management and sharing moving forward. It is one concrete institutional action taken by the NIH to build a more diverse, inclusive and equitable scientific enterprise, providing one small step toward the ultimate liberation of both Indigenous data and science and achieving Indigenous Data Sovereignty.&#8221;<br/><br/>Almost half of the RADx Tribal Data Repository university teams are led by Indigenous faculty scientists, including Krystal Tsosie (Din&#233; &#8211;Navajo) and Matt Anderson (Eastern Band of Cherokee descent.) Tsosie is a NativeBio cofounder and Assistant Professor at Arizona State University.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We started NativeBio with a very simple premise, that research on Indigenous Peoples&#8217; samples should be led by Indigenous community members and Indigenous scientists. So, &#8216;for us, by us&#8217; has been our motto,&#8221; Tsosie said. &#8220;Who is better than community members to drive researcher questions and to understand the data? Sometimes outsiders fail to understand other factors that contribute to disparities and health inequities outside the research samples.&#8221;<br/><br/>NativeBio is an Indigenous and independent 501 (C)(3) non-profit data repository and research institute founded in 2018 in Eagle Butte, South Dakota on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. NativeBio is the first Indigenous genomic biorepository led by Natives and located in a sovereign American Indian Nation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="36d2a268807270460002f3db7b4208a2"><name>lorena-hernandez-rivera</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>El Centro Resource Center inspires alumna’s future career</title><summary>Recent graduate Lorena Hernandez-Rivera strives to help others. </summary><start-date>1701676800000</start-date><display-name>lorena-hernandez-rivera</display-name><path>/2023/12/lorena-hernandez-rivera</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/12/lorena-hernandez-rivera</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1701726822996</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701730952515</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Latin American and Latino Studies</value><value>Education</value><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bayan Parrenas Shimizu</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/lorena-hernandez-rivera.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/lorena-hernandez-rivera.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>lorena-hernandez-rivera.jpeg</name><display-name>lorena-hernandez-rivera.jpeg</display-name><file-size>90777</file-size><width>450</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/lorena-hernandez-riverathumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/lorena-hernandez-riverathumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lorena-hernandez-riverathumb.jpg</name><display-name>lorena-hernandez-riverathumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17352</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Lorena Hernandez-Rivera&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">(Cowell &#8217;23)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the 7th grade, Lorena Hernandez-Rivera (Cowell &#8217;23) dreamed of attending UC Santa Cruz. Growing up on the Monterey Bay, UCSC was the first college campus Hernandez-Rivera ever visited; that visit inspired her to become her family&#8217;s first college graduate. Now, months after her graduation, Hernandez-Rivera looks to help others in the way that UCSC helped her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernandez-Rivera&#8217;s journey demonstrates a versatility in learning during her time at UCSC, crossing many fields and disciplines on her academic journey. Although she began her time at UCSC unsure of what field to pursue, she quickly discovered not just one, but three different disciplines to dive into. She received a B.A. in Latin American studies with a minor in Education, Democracy, and Justice after five years at UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I fell in love with Latin American Studies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The intro course was such a vibrant and enriching course. That&#8217;s where I met a lot of the people that ended up sticking with me for the next four years.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I went for Latin American Studies with Sociology because I wanted to do more in the Latin American field. I wanted to be more challenged and see what else is out there, especially because it's a very interdisciplinary field. I did Latin American Studies with Sociology, and then when I picked up an education minor my junior year, I realized what I wanted to do for my career path.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernandez-Rivera&#8217;s interest in higher education arose toward the end of her collegiate journey&#8212;yet quickly became an area of great aspiration. Afterwards, she began working with UCSC&#8217;s Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), whose mission is to provide both academic and personal support to low-income and first-generation college students. During her time at EOP, Hernandez-Rivera saw what could be her future career&#8212;one where she could help guide students like herself in an administrative role.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was really inspiring to see that [working for programs like EOP] and helping students like me is a possibility. It was such a beautiful community to be a part of.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Finding her community</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working with EOP, Hernandez-Rivera went on&#160; to work at what she describes as a &#8216;dream job&#8217; years in the making. After first learning of El Centro in her first year, she aspired to work with them. It was only in her&#160; fifth year that she secured a position&#8212;and fulfilled her freshman year dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Working at El Centro had been a dream job for me since my first year,&#8221; she said. I&#8217;d befriended a majority of Latino identifying friends in their third and second years, so they were always telling me about the different events that El Centro was hosting, and I would go with them. It was so beautiful to see the kind of community building and the feeling of a home that El Centro was able to create for students like me&#8212;and that was what drew me in immediately.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working on El Centro projects and events solidified Hernandez-Rivera&#8217;s goals to pursue education, and she quickly found a role model and mentor in El Centro Director Xiomara Lopez.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiomara Lopez studied higher education with counseling, so I felt like that was a sign that I was on the right track. Seeing how Xiomara is doing this amazing role makes me feel hopeful that that's in store for my future too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as El Centro shaped Hernandez-Rivera&#8217;s experience, she hopes the same for other UCSC students discovering the campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I was in Cowell, I didn&#8217;t really try different things on campus, and I felt stuck. For incoming UCSC students, break your bubble of comfort. When I would wake up in the morning, I would leave Cowell College, and go try out all the different study spaces or libraries, and then come back at the end of the day. There's so much more outside the dorms!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back at her time at UCSC, it&#8217;s clear how Hernandez-Rivera&#8217;s experiences prepared her for roles at EOP and El Centro. When finding her motivation, she need only look back on her own family&#8217;s background, and be reminded of the importance of El Centro to the student body.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What really kept me motivated for five years was thinking about my roots. I'm a daughter of immigrants, my parents immigrated from Mexico, and the highest formal education they had gotten was middle school with a G.E.D. in the US. Every year I kept pushing, I knew I was doing more for myself than they ever had.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="36dc40e9807270460002f3dbb4e324fd"><name>latino-alumni-network</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Stay connected with the Latino Alumni Network</title><summary>UCSC's Latino Alumni Network (LAN) is a unique partnership of Chicanx and Latinx-identified alumni, and El Centro, the Chicanx Latinx Resource Center, which is a special support services program for current students at UC Santa Cruz. </summary><start-date>1701676800000</start-date><display-name>latino-alumni-network</display-name><path>/2023/12/latino-alumni-network</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/12/latino-alumni-network</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1701727453397</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701727453397</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Amaris Trujillo and Guadalupe Sanchez</name><title></title><phone/><email>alumni@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/lan-lead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/lan-lead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lan-lead.jpg</name><display-name>lan-lead.jpg</display-name><file-size>90590</file-size><width>500</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/lan-thumnb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/lan-thumnb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lan-thumnb.jpg</name><display-name>lan-thumnb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14589</file-size><width>80</width><height>48</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz's Latino Alumni Network (LAN)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fellow Alumni,&#160;</span></p>

<p><span>The <strong>Latino Alumni Network</strong> <strong>(LAN)</strong> was founded in 2000 in conjunction with a reunion, Encuentro 2000. Three alumni&#8212;UC Santa Cruz professor Olga Najera-Ramirez, Andres Jimenez, and Leticia Quezada&#8212;formed the initial organizing committee. LAN is a unique partnership of Chicanx and Latinx-identified alumni, and <a href="https://elcentro.ucsc.edu/">El Centro</a>, the Chicanx Latinx Resource Center which is a special support services program for current students at UC Santa Cruz. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="370de00f807270460002f3dbc1e39a4f"><name>jade-goree</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A road to determination</title><summary>Jade Goree entered UCSC unsure of her future path—until she found a community with Black Academy and the AARCC.</summary><start-date>1701676800000</start-date><display-name>jade-goree</display-name><path>/2023/12/jade-goree</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/12/jade-goree</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1701730705406</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701730705406</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bayan Parrenas Shimizu</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/jade-goree-1.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/jade-goree-1.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>jade-goree-1.jpeg</name><display-name>jade-goree-1.jpeg</display-name><file-size>110090</file-size><width>450</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/jade-goree-1thumbanil.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/jade-goree-1thumbanil.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jade-goree-1thumbanil.jpg</name><display-name>jade-goree-1thumbanil.jpg</display-name><file-size>16332</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Jade Goree (Cowell &#8217;23)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jade Goree spent much of her precollegiate life as one of the few ABC (African, Black and Caribbean) students in a predominantly white community. As a Black woman, the negative experience that accompanied that time in her life left her worried that she&#8217;d continue without community during her time in college. With the help of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Black Academy and African American Resource &amp; Cultural Center (AARCC) Goree inevitably found a true community in her later years on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she first arrived at UCSC, Goree dealt with a major disconnect between her own lived experiences and the surrounding experiences of her peers. She said she felt isolated and without direction, but those feelings helped her decide her educational path in intensive psychology and education where she aimed to tackle issues of mental wellbeing within Black communities. She says after a turbulent four years at UCSC, she left with both experience and purpose.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her first year at UCSC, Goree joined the Black Academy and discovered the fun and productive environment she was seeking.&#160; Motivated by her own experience longing to find community, Goree quickly became a mentor for Black Academy, and guided future first-years along the first steps of college. In Black Academy, Goree felt truly valued as part of a community, and strived to get more involved. She later joined the AARCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goree began as a programming intern for the AARCC in her senior year. Her only regret: not joining sooner. Nevertheless, working with AARCC Program Coordinator Melissa Chimwaza, Goree found a role model and a path to a future career.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would&#8217;ve worked at the AARCC way sooner if I could have. I felt so validated working there and seeing Black women with power and confidence. It allowed me to see what life could be after college.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being from a predominantly white community, she often felt that blackness was portrayed to her as a monolith: negative messages about blackness through mass media and her peers were dominant during her childhood. Goree&#8217;s work at the AARCC helped tear down those preconceptions. Working with Black peers, Goree recalls finding an understanding of the multiplicity within race, and a confident future for herself.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goree now seeks out a goal of education reform with a focus in community psychology, inspired by what she learned about the prison-industrial complex during her studies. Now, Goree works in research at UCSC&#8217;s Migration, Identity, &amp; Education Lab while preparing to apply to graduate school, where she can continue her work in academia.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goree&#8217;s current study focuses on the educational experience of Black Muslim college students, with plans for educational reform and Black community wellness in academia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For current students at UCSC, Goree leaves some advice:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It can be hard, but find people who look like you or share common interests. Take the initiative!&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3a6b1874807270461432c49c853edf79"><name>thi-public-fellows</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>THI Graduate Public Fellows champion the relevance of Humanities education in a changing world</title><summary>An innovative Public Fellowship Program at the Humanities Institute (THI) is showing the important real-world impact of doctoral students’ humanities skills and expertise and offering exciting possibilities for the future of graduate education and career pathways. </summary><start-date>1701763200000</start-date><path>/2023/12/thi-public-fellows</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/12/thi-public-fellows</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1701787146317</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701885581804</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Saskia Nauenberg Dunkell</name><title></title><phone/><email>saskia@ucsc.edu</email></contact><contact><name>Kirstin Wagner</name><title></title><phone/><email>kilwagne@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/12/images/thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-144-scaled1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/12/images/thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-144-scaled1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-144-scaled1.jpg</name><display-name>thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-144-scaled.jpg</display-name><file-size>3559</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An innovative Public Fellowship Program at the Humanities Institute (THI) is showing the important real-world impact of doctoral students&#8217; humanities skills and expertise and offering exciting possibilities for the future of graduate education and career pathways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://youtu.be/6gGsD492tf4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new video </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about THI&#8217;s Public Fellowship program tells the story of humanities graduate students at UCSC who are bringing their humanities scholarship and training to organizations in Santa Cruz and around the world. The stories of THI Public Fellows are a testament to the vast opportunities for humanities PhDs and their ability to make impactful contributions to society, dispelling the notion that the decline in traditional academic positions in any way equates to any lesser significance of a humanities education.&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gGsD492tf4?si=PQxINuKYrb1vpyEi" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THI&#8217;s program demonstrates the tremendous possibilities for humanities doctoral students and shows how they are already actively enriching our society and working to build more just and equitable futures. A Shakespeare scholar translates her in-depth knowledge of lessons from plays that have remained relevant for over 400 years into social justice curriculum in high schools. A literature PhD student who studies South Asian languages works with a literary translation journal to publish translators and writers from other parts of the world, bringing these works to a US audience. Meanwhile, a historian uses his archival skills to preserve key historical materials from gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender communities and make them accessible to the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By empowering graduate students to apply their humanities expertise in these types of contexts, THI&#8217;s Public Fellows program enhances their scholarship and prepares them for diverse careers while bringing tangible benefits to partner organizations and creating a ripple effect of value that extends far beyond academia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As THI Faculty Director, Pranav Anand, explains, &#8220;Those of us privileged to teach and learn from graduate students in the humanities have daily reminders of the deep value of their intellectual rigor, relentless curiosity, and enormous creativity. In connecting them with communities outside of the academy, the Public Fellows program showcases the talents of humanities scholars, and what those talents can achieve in the world more broadly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-144-scaled.jpg" class="" height="333" src="images/thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-144-scaled.jpg" width="500"/></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Aruck, PhD Candidate in History, served as a THI Public Fellow with the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender (GLBT) Historical Society in San Francisco in 2020.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many THI Public Fellows, their positions not only open career pathways but the work also benefits their dissertation research. One of the PhD students featured in the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/6gGsD492tf4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/grad-profile-nathan-osorio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nathan Osorio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Literature student who received a Yearlong THI Public Fellowship to work with the Acquisitions Editorial team at UC Press. His work included developing a scouting list of prospective writers from feminist studies, criminology, law, economics, and technology studies, that UC Press might consider for publication in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Osorio, the program provided a key opportunity to get hands-on experience with publishing, an industry Osorio writes about as a scholar of Latinx poetics, but had not experienced first-hand. He explains, &#8220;I spend a lot of time thinking about how communities build knowledge and how they move it from one place to another. Through the THI Public Fellowship [at UC Press], I was able to take a peek behind the curtain and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the thing that I was studying.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program gave Osorio the chance to bring his expertise on marginalized writing communities to the UC Press Acquisitions team, while gaining inside experience about how book projects are selected and cultivated by a major academic press. &#8220;This has really shifted the way I write and the way I think about the problems I study.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature PhD Candidate Nathan Osorio (left), served as a THI Year Long Public Fellow with UC Press in 2022-23.

Both were mentored by Saskia Nauenberg Dunkell (right), THI&#8217;s Research Programs and Communications Manager.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other stories from THI&#8217;s Public Fellowship program further exemplify how humanities PhD students bring their scholarly background to projects with partner organizations. </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/grad-profile-katie-ohare/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie O&#8217;Hare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a PhD Candidate in Literature, who has served as a THI Public Fellow and C.L. Barber Fellow with Santa Cruz Shakespeare drew on her literary expertise and her pedagogical experiences to contribute to the Shakespeare and Social Justice program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with Rebecca Haley Clark, Santa Cruz Shakespeare&#8217;s Education Programs Manager, O&#8217;Hare developed a curriculum for high school students reading Shakespeare&#8217;s plays through the lens of social justice issues. O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s scholarly expertise has been immensely beneficial for Santa Cruz Shakespeare, as Clark explains: &#8220;Having a Public Fellow from The Humanities Institute is an invaluable part of our education department here at Santa Cruz Shakespeare because we have someone whose studies are focused specifically in the field that we are trying to introduce more students to. I consider Katie to be my expert in the field.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, O&#8217;Hare emphasizes how meaningful her work with Santa Cruz Shakespeare has been and how the collaboration has allowed her to have a more significant impact in the world. &#8220;This is what it should be about,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It really matters to be doing these kinds of Public Fellowships because programs like this are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnerships</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rather than just being tucked away in a university, doing your studies isolated in your room or in the library alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-1-scaled.jpg" class="" height="333" src="images/thi-public-fellows-2023-wcc-1-scaled.jpg" width="500"/></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature PhD Candidate Katie O&#8217;Hare (right) with Rebecca Haley Clark, Santa Cruz Shakespeare&#8217;s Education Programs Manager.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception in 2016, </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/public-fellows-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">THI&#8217;s Public Fellows Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has connected more than 60 graduate students with 45 organizations in Santa Cruz and around the world, including The Center for the Study of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities in Oslo, Norway, the Tucson Chinese Cultural Center, the Japanese American Museum in San Jose, and the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, THI expanded the program to incorporate a vibrant undergraduate component that also provides humanities majors and minors with paid opportunities to partner with organizations outside of the university. In several cases, THI Graduate Public Fellows have served as mentors for THI Undergraduate Public Fellows creating a multi-layered mentorship structure with manifold benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the program, THI Research Programs and Communications Manager, Saskia Nauenberg Dunkell, meets with students to discuss connections between their academic scholarship and positions and reflect on the skills and training they are gaining through their Public Fellowship experiences. Dunkell describes, &#8220;these partnerships are often transformative for students and in some cases directly lead to job offers. It&#8217;s opening up a whole new world of possibilities.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THI Managing Director, Irena Poli&#263;, who co-founded the program, shares how this initiative is part of the institute&#8217;s larger mission. &#8220;Our three pillars of work are research, student success, and public engagement and the Public Fellows program exemplifies how important it is for these pillars to work together. We have been actively engaged in local and national conversations around graduate education in the humanities for a decade now and are extremely proud of the pioneering work we&#8217;ve done in this area.&#8221; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THI's Public Fellowship Program is part of a call to ensure that humanities scholars are brought into organizations and companies in a range of sectors &#8211; from nonprofits to government to technology &#8211; in a world that needs their insights more than ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Osorio describes, the key is to remember how important it is to keep building those bridges outside the academy. As he explains, &#8220;if the humanities stays in the university, then it&#8217;s not achieving its full potential.&#8221; This is why the THI Public Fellows Program is so important. Because it &#8220;brings the humanities to the people that need it, to the publics we want to see represented within it. It&#8217;s about working not only solitarily, but in the streets, in the libraries, in the bookshops, and with the people who have the most to gain from it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program supports the post-grad student seeking to boost their GPA in science courses, prepare for the MCAT, complete their medical school application, and better understand their career options.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through new regional collaborations, customized study plans, and rigorous University of California instruction, we will be infusing the landscape with a new generation of medical school applicants,&#8221; said P.K. Agarwal, dean of UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Extension.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a UC San Francisco research report regarding the primary care workforce, &#8220;&#8203;&#8203;California will likely face a statewide shortfall of clinicians in the next 15 years. Some regions may face greater shortages than others because providers are not evenly distributed across all regions of the state</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are profoundly concerned that healthcare access is critically limited by shortages in the system and believe that our program will directly serve students coming from some of the most disadvantaged communities along the Central Coast of California.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

But the tiny organ models are very tricky to grow and maintain in the lab, meaning many students majoring in biotech-related fields enter the workforce or advanced degree programs&#160; without experience working with organoids.&#160;<br/><br/>Now, for the first time, remote education tools have allowed undergraduate students to gain direct experience experimenting with cortical organoids grown at UC Santa Cruz. These innovative teaching techniques are the product of efforts led by UCSC Genomics Institute Research Scientist Mohammed Mostajo-Radji and are described in a <a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/early/2023/11/24/ENEURO.0308-23.2023">new paper</a> published in the journal <em>eNeuro</em>.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Right now, it&#8217;s difficult to use organoids in the classroom, so there&#8217;s a disconnect between the skills that are required in the job market versus what the universities can provide,&#8221; Mostajo-Radji said. &#8220;It's a very long and very expensive [process] to make organoids, so it's not really compatible with classroom learning.&#8221;<br/><br/>In their initial efforts to bring the models into undergraduate education, Mostajo-Radji and his team at the <a href="https://genomics.ucsc.edu/cloud-based-technologies/">Live Cell Biotechnology Discovery Lab</a> introduced two classrooms to their method of designing experiments and observing organoids with remote-controlled microscopes and multielectrode arrays.<br/><br/>The team&#8217;s <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/11/remote-biology-experiments.html">previous experiments</a> with their remote-controlled microscopes brought the technology into biology classrooms in several Latinx communities in the United States and Latin America, enabling these students to design and carry out tissue culture experiments. They found their microscopy technology, developed by Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Mircea Teodorescu&#8217;s Lab, to be an effective and scalable approach for giving students who have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM the ability to conduct complex experiments remotely. However, this new paper marks the first time they&#8217;ve combined remote education methods with the study of organoids.<br/><br/>&#8220;Our platform has bridged a gap between advanced scientific research and online learning. With the tools we've been working on, students have the ability to engage with complex biological systems in an accessible, remote environment,&#8221; said Ash Robbins, a co-first author on the paper. &#8220;It has been wild to see how the students were able to interactively create and explore scientific questions. This has given the students the same capabilities I use for my own research on cortical organoids, and it amazes me to see the novel approaches they take from their own unique perspectives.&#8221;<br/><br/>One of the two classes was a more traditional, introductory-level biology tissue culture class at the University of San Francisco, and enabled the students to do live experiments with the effects of different drugs on organoids.&#160;<br/><br/>The second class was a new upper-level mathematics course at UCSC called &#8220;Mathematics of the Mind&#8221; taught by David Haussler, Distinguished Professor of Biomolecular Engineering and an author on the <em>eNeuro</em> paper. In the class, which will be offered again in Spring 2024 at UCSC, students used multielectrode arrays to look at patterns of simulation in cortical organoids in order to understand the mathematical properties of how brain circuits change over time.<br/><br/>To the researchers&#8217; knowledge, this marked the first time that multielectrode arrays have been used in a classroom setting, and presented an opportunity that would not normally be available to students outside of biology wet labs.&#160;<br/><br/>Through surveys in both courses, the researchers found that the remote experiments with organoids developed students&#8217; interest in stem cell and neuroscience.<br/><br/>&#8220;It was amazing watching the students light up as they performed science experiments for the first time,&#8221; said Matthew Elliott, a co-first author on the paper who was a Teaching Assistant in the class. &#8220;Many of them came from strictly computational backgrounds like math and computer science and never dreamed that they'd be creating their own complex biological experiments. This course inspired many students to start doing research in computational neuroscience, and even inspired some to pursue Ph.D.s. I am proud to have made this impact on the lives of others.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;The reason I am excited to be a part of the Live Cell Biotechnology Discovery Lab is that I get to bring my love of science to the next generation of students,&#8221; said Hunter Schweiger, another co-first author. &#8220;Growing up in Bakersfield, there was never a support system for the types of experiments that we are able to have the students design themselves. Seeing the excitement from students growing up in a similar atmosphere to mine is one of the most rewarding things I have ever participated in.&#8221;<br/><br/>Schweiger prepared the organoids used by both the USF and UCSC classes, while Robbins translated the complex software for the simulation of organoids into an easier interface for students in this class to use.<br/><br/>With the success of their approach in the initial two undergraduate courses, the team is interested in expanding the technology to bring remote organoid education to more students. By transmitting their microscope feed through Youtube, the technology is more scalable, supporting&#160; applications even in areas of low internet bandwidth.&#160;<br/><br/>The team is actively seeking new partnerships to bring their technology to more students, and welcomes anyone interested in collaboration to reach out.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This team, Mo, Elliott, Ash, Hunter, Sebastian and others, successfully pioneered an exciting new platform for learning neuroscience,&#8221; Haussler said. &#8220;I feel we just barely scratched the surface regarding the potential of this technology. Someday students studying neuroscience from anywhere in the world will be able to learn by remotely performing and analyzing the results from diverse actual experiments on lab-grown human or mouse neural tissue in the form of cerebral organoids. The possibilities are incredibly exciting."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3ba4feb2807270461432c49cc7fb5aeb"><name>first-rain-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>An important message about first rain</title><summary>First rain activities are unsafe and unsanctioned by the University and students should refrain from participating. </summary><start-date>1701763200000</start-date><display-name>An important message about first rain</display-name><path>/2023/12/first-rain-message</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/12/first-rain-message</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1701807717924</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1701807808716</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><a href="#spanish"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>en espa&#241;ol</span></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Slugs,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As fall comes to a close and winter nears, I&#8217;m writing to touch base with all of you about first rain. The changing seasons can often bring much needed rain to our area. As the likelihood for forecasted rain increases, I am concerned some students may be inclined to participate in first rain activities. These activities are unsafe and unsanctioned by the University and students should refrain from participating.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your Dean of Students, I think it&#8217;s wonderful that students are eager to gather, to build community amongst each other and to develop rituals and traditions unique to being a Banana Slug. Students have shown up in record numbers to Welcome Week events and many other activities throughout fall quarter. First rain, however, is not a safe or healthy outlet for coming together as a student body.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, participation in this activity has resulted in serious injury to students, damage to campus property, and has created more work for staff, leading to an increased cost to university operations. With respect to past actions, please know that jumping the fence and/or entering the swimming pool is considered trespassing and constitutes a violation of </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/studenthandbook_2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">university policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and law.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I don&#8217;t want anyone to get hurt or have their UC Santa Cruz journey adversely impacted as a result of participating in these activities, I ask each of you to please honor our </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/principles-community/#:&#126;:text=The%20University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa,practice%20these%20Principles%20of%20Community."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principles of Community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by making safe decisions&#8211;for yourself and your fellow Banana Slugs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for taking the time to read this and for considering your safety and the safety of other students.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a id="spanish"></a>Estimado Slugs,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A medida que el oto&#241;o llega a su fin y el invierno se acerca, les escribo para hablar sobre La Primera Lluvia (The First Rain). Los cambios de estaci&#243;n suelen traer la tan necesaria lluvia a nuestra zona. Como la probabilidad de lluvia prevista contin&#250;a, me preocupa que algunos alumnos se sientan inclinados a participar en las actividades de La Primera Lluvia. Estas actividades no son seguras ni est&#225;n autorizadas por la Universidad y los estudiantes deben abstenerse de participar en ellas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Como Decano de estudiantes, creo que es maravilloso que los estudiantes est&#233;n dispuestos a reunirse, para construir una comunidad entre s&#237; y desarrollar rituales y tradiciones &#250;nicas de ser una Banana Slug. Los estudiantes han aparecido en n&#250;meros r&#233;cord en los eventos de la Semana de Bienvenida y muchas otras actividades durante todo el trimestre de oto&#241;o. La primera lluvia, sin embargo, no es una salida segura o saludable para reunirse como un cuerpo estudiantil.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">En el pasado, la participaci&#243;n en esta actividad ha resultado en lesiones graves a los estudiantes, da&#241;os a la propiedad del campus, y ha creado m&#225;s trabajo para el personal, lo que lleva a un aumento de costes para las operaciones de la universidades. Con respecto a acciones del pasado, sepan que saltar la valla y/o entrar la piscina se considera allanamiento de morada y constituye una </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/studenthandbook_2020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violacion de la pol&#237;tica de la universidad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> y la ley.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porque no quiero que nadie se lastime o que su viaje a UC Santa Cruz tenga un impacto adverso como resultado de participar en estas actividades, les pido a cada uno de ustedes que por favor honren nuestros </span><a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/principles-community/#:&#126;:text=The%20University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa,practice%20these%20Principles%20of%20Community."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principios de Comunidad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tomando decisiones seguras-para ustedes y sus compa&#241;eros Banana Slugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gracias por tomarse el tiempo para leer esto y por considerar su seguridad y la seguridad de otros estudiantes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">En Comunidad,&#160;</span></p>

The program provides a supportive structure in which participants can cultivate contacts, explore challenges and enhance effectiveness as they design their personal growth and career paths.&#160;<br/><br/>Once pairs are set, mentors and mentees will define the shape and scope of their personal experience. Some pairs may choose more reading suggestions, for example, where others may choose to rely exclusively on dialogue. The mentor program will officially run for 10 months.<br/><br/><strong>Program Cycles</strong><br/>The Staff Mentorship Program cycle will run for a total of 10 months. The next program cycle will run from February through November 2024. &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Who Can Participate</strong><br/>Mentors are experienced UCSC career employees and well-respected advisors, coaches and colleagues that guide and challenge, and who are willing to share their experiences.<br/><br/>Mentees are UCSC career employees interested in career development and who have relatively fewer years of service.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Eligibility requirements for 2024 program participants include:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Career, partial-year career and contract employees</li>
<li>Current satisfactory (or better) performance evaluation</li>
<li>Successful completion of probation by January 1, 2024</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>How the Program Works</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Mentees accepted for the program will be notified shortly after the application deadline.</li>
<li>Mentees and mentors accepted for the program will be invited to a networking Program Kick-Off Mixer event which will take place in late January 2024. At this event mentors and mentees can meet in an informal setting. Mentees and mentors will receive the date, time and location of the Program Kick-Off Mixer Reception via email.</li>

Lewis College tradition. Live and in-person for the first time in three years, the event </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">showcased nine impassioned students who told stories of life experiences that have shaped who they are today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Storytelling can be a vehicle for communication, validation, and strengthening of core individual and group identity at a time of life when that can be in flux,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Goodman, a faculty member who has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been shepherding students&#8217; Slug Stories since its founding in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual event marks the culmination of a first-year experience program steeped in storytelling. First introduced seven years ago by College Provost Flora Lu, the Slug Stories program integrates narrative writing into the Core Course and hosts a series of events, story slams, and a </span><a href="https://slugstories.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stories have ranged topically from the hilarious to the deeply sad to the revelatory. I&#8217;ve heard stories of recovery from addiction or mental illness, of surviving a terrorist attack, and of dating someone with special needs,&#8221; said Goodman. &#8220;Slug Stories are a kaleidoscope of human experience, and at their best evoke empathy and deep listening.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year students wrote about 1,000 narratives; 50 will be uploaded to the Slug Story archive, and nine were told in person at the Slug Stories Slam. The event&#8217;s emcee and organizer, College Nine Academic Manager Madison Armstrong, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasizes storytelling as a way for students to connect with others and show up for themselves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As someone who has overcome a lot of struggles to be able to live proudly and confidently in myself, I&#8217;ve found storytelling to be a way to express myself and find common ground and understanding with others,&#8221; said Armstrong. &#8220;Through my work on the Slug Story initiative, I am able to be a catalyst for students to use and build their voice &#8230; When starting college, I think so much can get lost in going to school, hitting the books, and getting a degree. Slug Stories provides a space for students to be able to speak about themselves, their lives, their passions, what&#8217;s important to them, and build a lasting community around that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armstrong envisions a future for the program that includes story slams for the entire college community, an expanded digital archive to include more stories, videos, and images, and is excited about an affiliated storytelling course that Goodman is developing for the 2024-25 academic year. The course will explore storytelling through written and oral presentation to help students explore individual and group identities and communicate cultural values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Slug Story initiative and the upcoming course hope to shape the future of narrative exploration on campus, forge new connections, and strengthen individual and group identity during a critical time in students' lives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These stories paint a vivid portrait of UC Santa Cruz students, going beyond the data points and superficial exteriors,&#8221; said Armstrong. &#8220;This project not only helps students find connectedness with one another but also offers staff and faculty insight into who our students are and reminds us all why we are here.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="45f2f408807270467687f73cc0157b5b"><name>ancient-carbon-dioxide</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A new 66 million-year history of carbon dioxide offers little comfort for today</title><summary>A massive new review of ancient atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels and corresponding temperatures lays out a daunting picture of where the Earth’s climate may be headed. </summary><start-date>1702022400000</start-date><display-name>A new 66 million-year history of carbon dioxide offers little comfort for today</display-name><path>/2023/12/ancient-carbon-dioxide</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/12/ancient-carbon-dioxide</link><created-by>rbwall</created-by><created-on>1701980599275</created-on><last-modified-by>rbwall</last-modified-by><last-modified>1702052972748</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Kevin Krajick (Columbia University) and Renee Wall (UCSC)</name><title></title><phone/><email>rbwall@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/12/images/co2-1.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/12/images/co2-1.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>co2-1.jpeg</name><display-name>co2-1.jpeg</display-name><file-size>368956</file-size><width>740</width><height>493</height></image><image-alt>The back of a researcher walking across the Greenland Ice Sheet</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/12/images/co2-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/12/images/co2-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>co2-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>co2-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19865</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>The back of a researcher walking across the Greenland Ice Sheet</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet, where recent melting has left bare ground. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Kevin Krajick/Earth Institute)</span></i></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/12/images/co2-2.png</path><link>site://news/2023/12/images/co2-2.png</link><site>news</site><name>co2-2.png</name><display-name>co2-2.png</display-name><file-size>104656</file-size><width>3600</width><height>1740</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Temperatures and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide over the past 66 million years.

The study covers geologic records spanning the past 66 million years, putting present-day concentrations into context with deep time. Among other things, it indicates that the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide consistently reached today&#8217;s human-driven levels was 14 million years ago&#8212;much longer ago than </span><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/7/graphic-carbon-dioxide-hits-new-high/#:&#126;:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20Pliocene.,high%20as%20they%20are%20today."><span style="font-weight: 400;">some existing assessments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It asserts that long-term climate is highly sensitive to the greenhouse gas, with cascading effects that may evolve over many millennia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study was assembled over seven years by a consortium of more than 80 researchers from 16 nations&#160;and was published in the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi5177"><i>Science</i></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pratigya Polissar, professor of Ocean Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been involved with this project since its initiation. Polissar led the group evaluating one of the methods used to reconstruct atmospheric CO2. This particular method, based on studying phytoplankton in the ocean, has evolved significantly over the past few decades.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have long known that adding CO2 to our atmosphere raises the temperature,&#8221; said </span><a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/directory/baerbel-hoenisch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B&#228;rbel H&#246;nisch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a geochemist at Columbia University&#8217;s </span><a href="https://lamont.columbia.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who coordinated the consortium. &#8220;This study gives us a much more robust idea of how sensitive the climate is over long time scales.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mainstream estimates say that on scales of decades to centuries, every doubling of atmospheric CO2 will drive average global temperatures 1.5&#160; to 4.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 8.1 Fahrenheit) higher. However, at least </span><a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/11/03/world-temperatures-will-blow-past-paris-goals-this-decade-asserts-new-study/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one recent widely read study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> argues that the current consensus underestimates planetary sensitivity, putting it at 3.6 to 6 C degrees of warming per doubling. In any case, given current trends, all estimates put the planet perilously close to or beyond the 2 degrees warming that could be reached this century, and which many scientists agree we must avoid if at all possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1700s, the air contained about 280 parts per million (ppm) of CO2. We are now up to 420 ppm, an increase of about 50%; by the end of the century, we could reach 600 ppm or more. As a result, we are already somewhere along the uncertain warming curve, with a rise of about 1.2 degrees C (2.2 degrees F) since the late 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever temperatures eventually turn out to be, most estimates of future warming draw information from studies of how temperatures moved with CO2 in the past. For this, scientists analyze materials including&#160; air bubbles trapped in ice cores, the chemistry of ancient soils and ocean sediments, and the anatomy of fossil plant leaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consortium&#8217;s members did not collect new data; rather, they came together to sort through published studies to assess their reliability, based on evolving knowledge. They excluded some that they found outdated or incomplete in the light of new findings, and recalibrated others to account for the latest analytical techniques. Then they calculated a new 66-million-year curve of CO2 versus temperatures based on all the evidence so far, coming to a consensus on what they call &#8220;earth system sensitivity.&#8221; By this measure, they say, a doubling of CO2 is predicted to warm the planet a whopping 5 to 8 degrees C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant caveat: earth system sensitivity describes climate changes over hundreds of thousands of years, not the decades and centuries that are immediately relevant to humans. The authors say that over long periods, increases in temperature may emerge from intertwined Earth processes that go beyond the immediate greenhouse effect created by CO2 in the air. These include melting of polar ice sheets, which would reduce the Earth&#8217;s ability to reflect solar energy; changes in terrestrial plant cover; and changes in clouds and atmospheric aerosols that could either heighten or lower temperatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you want us to tell you what the temperature will be in the year 2100, this does not tell you that. But it does have a bearing on present climate policy,&#8221; said coauthor Dana Royer, a paleoclimatologist at Wesleyan University. &#8220;It strengthens what we already thought we knew. It also tells us that there are sluggish, cascading effects that will last for thousands of years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H&#246;nisch said the study will be useful for climate modelers trying to predict what will happen in coming decades, because they will be able to feed the newly robust observations into their studies, and disentangle processes that operate on short versus long time scales. She noted that all the project&#8217;s data are available in an open database, and will be updated on a rolling basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new study, covering the so-called Cenozoic era, does not radically revise the generally accepted relationship between CO2 and temperature, but it does strengthen the understanding of certain time periods, and refines measurements of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most distant period, from about 66 million to 56 million years ago, has been something of an enigma, because the Earth was largely ice free, yet some studies had suggested CO2 concentrations were relatively low. This cast some doubt on the relationship between CO2 and temperature. However once the consortium excluded estimates they deemed the least dependable, they determined that CO2 was actually quite high&#8212;around 600 to 700 parts per million, comparable to what could be reached by the end of this century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers confirmed the long-held belief that the hottest period was about 50 million years ago, when CO2 spiked to as much as 1,600 ppm, and temperatures were as much as 12 degrees C higher than today. But by around 34 million years ago, CO2 had sunk enough that the present-day Antarctic ice sheet began developing. With some ups and downs, this was followed by a further long-term CO2 decline, during which the ancestors of many modern-day plants and animals evolved. This suggests, the paper&#8217;s authors say, that variations in CO2 affect not only climate, but ecosystems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new assessment says that about 16 million years ago was the last time CO2 was consistently higher than now, at about 480 ppm; and by 14 million years ago it had sunk to today&#8217;s human-induced level of 420 ppm. The decline continued, and by about 2.5 million years ago, CO2 reached about 270 or 280 ppm, kicking off a series of ice ages. It was at or below that when modern humans came into being about 400,000 years ago, and persisted there until we started messing with the atmosphere on a grand scale about 250 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Regardless of exactly how many degrees the temperature changes, it&#8217;s clear we have already brought the planet into a range of conditions never seen by our species,&#8221; said study co-author Gabriel Bowen, a professor at the University of Utah. &#8220;It should make us stop and question what is the right path forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consortium has now evolved into </span><a href="https://paleo-co2.org/co2pip"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a larger project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aims to chart how CO2 and climate have evolved over the entire Phanerozoic eon, from 540 million years ago to present.&#160;This <a href="https://paleo-co2.org/co2pip">project's website</a> provides visualization of the paleo CO2 measurements presented in the paper, as well as a FAQ section for those interested in the methods used for the different measurements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polissar&#8217;s lab is now working on an NSF-funded research project to investigate how other factors, in addition to CO2 levels, affect the algal CO2 proxy through controlled laboratory experiments and analysis of modern ocean sediments. These findings can then be applied to ancient ocean sediments, in order to improve interpretations of reconstructed CO2 levels in the past. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4636429e807270467687f73ceeab9f0e"><name>cpevc-remarks-on-academic-freedom-fall-academic-senate</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>CPEVC remarks on academic freedom at Fall Academic Senate Meeting</title><summary>I write today to convey a portion of my remarks at the Fall Academic Senate meeting held on November 29, 2023.

With academic freedom and free speech, universities are ideally situated to foster deeper understanding of complex issues and to support constructive debate.&#8221; Further, we noted, &#8220;the high regard we have for the right to free speech of our community members, and the foundational commitment to sustain an educational environment in which people disagree while maintaining an ethic of care.&#8221;</span><br/><br/><span>I have been inspired by the many ways this community has advanced understanding and compassion in difficult times.</span><br/><br/><span>Please allow me the patience of quoting APM 010.</span><br/><br/><span>&#8220;The University of California is committed to upholding and preserving principles of academic freedom. These principles reflect the University&#8217;s fundamental mission, which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it to its students and to society at large. The principles of academic freedom protect freedom of inquiry and research, freedom of teaching, and freedom of expression and publication. These freedoms enable the University to advance knowledge and to transmit it effectively to its students and to the public. The University also seeks to foster in its students a mature independence of mind, and this purpose cannot be achieved unless students and faculty are free within the classroom to express the widest range of viewpoints in accord with the standards of scholarly inquiry and professional ethics. The exercise of academic freedom entails correlative duties of professional care when teaching, conducting research, or otherwise acting as a member of the faculty. These duties are set forth in the Faculty Code of Conduct (APM - 015).&#8221;</span><br/><br/><span>I note here that this expression of academic freedom directly addresses the relationship between academic freedom and teaching. That one essential aspect of faculty teaching is to foster independence of mind in our students. And that the exercise of academic freedom implies professional responsibilities&#8211;here defined specifically as &#8220;duties of professional care&#8221;&#8211;as well.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>APM 010&#8217;s second paragraph states, &#8220;Academic freedom requires that teaching and scholarship be assessed by reference to the professional standards that sustain the University&#8217;s pursuit and achievement of knowledge. The substance and nature of these standards properly lie within the expertise and authority of the faculty as a body. The competence of the faculty to apply these standards of assessment is recognized in the Standing Orders of The Regents, which establish a system of shared governance between the Administration and the Academic Senate. Academic freedom requires that the Academic Senate be given primary responsibility for applying academic standards, subject to appropriate review by the Administration, and that the Academic Senate exercise its responsibility in full compliance with applicable standards of professional care.&#8221;</span><br/><br/><span>These two paragraphs articulate the relationship between academic freedom, the professional autonomy of the professoriate, and standards of professional care. What counts as knowledge, scholarship and teaching turns on the application of professional standards of judgment that lie within the expertise and authority of the faculty as a body, and of the Academic Senate specifically. The quality of faculty work is to be judged only by reference to professional standards of academic judgment. This is to insulate faculty from inappropriate bases of judgment, and I stand wholeheartedly behind that and behind our campus&#8217; history of putting academic freedom in the service of social justice. &#160;</span><br/><br/><span>APM 010 articulates what faculty must undertake to comply with professional standards in performance of their duties. In teaching, professional standards require that faculty provide students with an environment to think freely and exercise independent judgment; that faculty evaluate students solely on the merits of their work and that they not penalize students because of their political or religious beliefs.</span><br/><span>&#160;</span><br/><span>Academic freedom implies professional autonomy and professional responsibility.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>A note about what I value. As an academic community, our commitment is to inclusivity and academic excellence. I&#8217;ll borrow from our UC Middle Eastern history and Jewish Studies colleagues, in their public response to President Drake&#8217;s comments at the Regents&#8217; meeting, which I suspect many of you have seen or will soon see: &#160;&#8220;we have amongst us scholars who contribute to a democratic society and a more peaceful world by teaching students the skills to evaluate different points of view based on evidence, rigorous inquiry, best pedagogical practices, and peer-reviewed scholarship free from external interference and political pressure. These skills are particularly necessary in the current political climate, when intellectual debate and critical engagement are coming under attack.&#8221;&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>By engaging together in writing such a letter to President Drake, while also vigorously engaging with each other when their analysis of this moment differs, these colleagues offer us a model of what academic freedom at a great research university is and should be.&#160;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Senate Faculty</audience><admin>Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4a93eb7f807270467ad000d689b1b250"><name>sydne-raiyn</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>The Alumni Association welcomes Sydne Raiyn to lead alumni diversity programs</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association is excited to welcome Sydne Raiyn as the incoming Associate Director of Alumni Diversity Programs.

In this role, Raiyn will work closely with the Office of Student Success and Alumni Engagement to provide strategic direction for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging work with the alumni community through communications, events, and more. She will begin her new role at UCSC in Jan. 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want our alumni to know that I am going to be an ally and an advocate for them,&#8221; Raiyn said. &#8220;I want them to feel heard, valued, appreciated, and engaged and I'm going to do everything I can to get to know those within this alumni community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is excited to bring her experience in relationship and community building, as well as event and planning experience, to UCSC&#8217;s Alumni Association.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to bring a new energy and a positive and fun vibe. I definitely want to bring some creativity to the table and come up with new and innovative ways to engage our alumni. Ultimately, I want to be able to bring my passion and work ethic to create really impactful and memorable experiences for our alumni.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raiyn joined UC Santa Cruz in Jan. 2020 as the Assistant Director of Athletics and Recreation. Coming from Las Vegas two months before the COVID-19 Pandemic shut down campus-wide operations, she was forced to learn quickly, get creative, and reinvent the wheel.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After three years with the Athletics and Recreation Department, Raiyn began looking for opportunities to expand outside athletics and grow further in the higher education capacity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This specific position really aligns with my core values, and it's going to give me the opportunity to promote something that's near and dear to me, which is diversity, equity and inclusion.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raiyn grew up in St. Louis, Missouri before heading to Michigan to attend the University of Michigan. She earned her B.A. in Sports Management and had a substantial career in athletics. Prior to coming to Santa Cruz, Raiyn worked in athletic recruiting at Next College Student Athlete. Initially, as a Recruiting Coordinator, Sydne focused on identifying talent and pre-qualified college-bound prospects based on NCAA academic and athletic requirements in an effort to help college coaches build a pipeline of certified student-athletes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has lived in both Philadelphia and Vegas but says living in California was always the dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What I've learned since being on campus the last (almost) four years is that there is no place like Santa Cruz. UC Santa Cruz is a very unique and special place, is a special university, and has a special community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5f3b7fb380727046610d553859bf95db"><name>gender-recognition-lived-name-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Gender Recognition and Lived Name Policy </title><summary>In November 2020, UC announced a systemwide Gender Recognition and Lived Name (GRLN) Policy.

There are many reasons why people change their names. In the LGBTQIA+ community, for example, a new name is often chosen to align with gender identity. Our campus continues to be a leader in this area, going beyond mandated compliance to ensure the protection of all community members.<br/><br/>In November 2020, UC announced a systemwide <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2700693/GRLN">Gender Recognition and Lived Name (GRLN) Policy</a><span>&#160;</span>to ensure all students, faculty, staff, alumni and affiliates are identified by their desired gender identity and lived or preferred name on university-issued documents and in UC&#8217;s information systems. While UCSC has been in compliance with the spirit of the new policy since 2011 for students, the deadline for full compliance with the policy is December 31, 2023. MyUCSC will be in full compliance at the end of January 2024, with other downstream student systems following closely.&#160;<br/><br/>The policy requires UC campuses, medical centers and research facilities to:</div>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>Provide three equally recognized gender options on university-issued documents and information systems &#8212; female, male and non-binary.</li>
<li>Provide an efficient process for students and employees to amend their gender designations and lived names on university-issued documents and in information systems retroactively.&#160;</li>
<li>Secure the legal name of university students, employees, alumni and affiliates if different than the individual&#8217;s lived name. The person&#8217;s legal name must be kept confidential and must not be published or displayed in IT Resource systems where it is not required.</li>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArtReview</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> praised Julien for his &#8220;transgressive reworkings of history and time itself, (which) have expanded our potential to deal with the complexities of the present and paved the way for generations of artists to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C0fegriIxJJ/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his Instagram page,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Julien reacted to this honor.&#160; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you Art Review for your kind support and for that incredibly moving review/text of &#8216;What Freedom means to me&#8217; by Prince Shakur which I will cherish for a long time!,&#8221; Julien posted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His high ranking in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArtReview </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only the latest of Julien&#8217;s recent accolades.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien was listed among a group of luminaries in Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-queens-birthday-honours-2022-high-awards/the-queens-birthday-honours-2022-high-awards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 Birthday Honors List</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in honor of her Platinum Jubilee for his services to diversity and inclusion in art.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in 2022, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the international organization best known for the Academy Awards, extended an invitation of membership to Julien, putting him at center stage once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder said that Julien&#8217;s recent honors call&#160; attention to his powerful, discipline-spanning work, while highlighting his important contributions to both the Arts and the Humanities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sir Isaac Julien&#8217;s work uses photography and film to operate as a kind of aspirational time machine bringing us closer to historical possibility and interrogating issues such as racial violence, queer identity, and displacement,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His work transcends categories and genres.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArtReview</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;s recognition of Sir Isaac Julien speaks to the global reach and impact of his body of work,&#8221; said UCSC Arts Dean Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu.&#160; "As I said at my remarks during the opening of his retrospective at the Tate, &#8216;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sir Isaac&#8217;s groundbreaking exhibitions and body of work are powerful for helping the global community &#8211; and life-changing for our students.&#8217; And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that the honors he received from</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ArtReview</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and his recent knighthood, draw increased attention and recognition to the Isaac Julien Lab at UCSC, as well as the platforms of exhibition and dissemination that Professor Julien shared with his students here at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><em>ArtReview&#160;</em>also <a href="https://artreview.com/artist/donna-haraway/?year=2023">prominently mentioned UCSC Anthropology Professor Anna Tsing</a> and <a href="https://artreview.com/artist/donna-haraway/?year=2023">UCSC Professor Emerita in the History of consciousness and Feminist Studies departments Donna Haraway</a> in the same Power 100 list.&#160;</p>
<p><em>ArtReview</em> celebrated Tsing for "her<span>&#160;understanding of the Anthropocene &#8211; not as an existential planetary event, but as something occurring locally and with different intensities and causes and consequences &#8211; has been enthusiastically adopted by the art world. Tsing&#8217;s redefining of the relationships between human, nonhuman and object has had wide influence, evident in the ecological turn taken by many artists and curators in their work."</span></p>
<p><span>The same issue called Haraway "a touchstone: her writing addresses so many of our current issues, from the environment, to gender and queer identity, to AI and tech. Haraway&#8217;s thinking is nothing if not intersectional: regarding her papal citation, coming despite her long history of criticising the Catholic Church, she quipped, &#8216;Some baby Jesuit who&#8217;s into animal studies and science studies and feminist theory for some weird reason has been reading me&#8217;. They&#8217;re not alone."</span></p>
<p><strong>A distinguished career&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien&#8217;s practice is informed by the critical and theoretical ambition of British cultural studies, always viewed through an aesthetic regime. He has collaborated with affiliated faculty, including Professor of Literature Chris Connery, and with History of Consciousness alumni including</span><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/climate-change-and-the-new-polar-aesthetics"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lisa Bloom, author of the recently published book C</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">limate Change and the new Polar Aesthetics.</span></i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien&#8217;s art practice draws from and commenting on film, dance, photography, music, theater, painting, and sculpture, uniting them to give voice to the experiences of disregarded, often Black, and queer narratives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think about the sheer amount of concentration one needs to do the work,&#8221; Julien said in a recent interview with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz News</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;One must try to not let anything including the high points detract from that. It&#8217;s important to keep one&#8217;s head in place, as it were, and one&#8217;s feet firmly on the ground.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julien is offering an undergraduate History of Consciousness course to UCSC students this winter, &#8220;What Freedom Is To Me,&#8221; which is also the name of the survey of his work at the Tate. The class is an opportunity to study with Julien and offers insight into the production and critical reception of moving image, video art and installation work by examining contemporary and historical art practice.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6419a7c580727046719366180192faf2"><name>bus-collision</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Support resources following campus bus collision</title><summary>We are deeply heartbroken to share that five students and an employee were injured last night in a UC Santa Cruz bus collision near the main entrance.</summary><start-date>1702454400000</start-date><display-name>Support resources following campus bus collision</display-name><path>/2023/12/bus-collision</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/12/bus-collision</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1702486452149</created-on><last-modified-by>gardnert</last-modified-by><last-modified>1704744213807</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>chancellor</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Dear Campus Community, </span></p>
<p><span>We are deeply heartbroken to share that five students and an employee were injured last night in a UC Santa Cruz bus collision near the main entrance. Two people were taken to the hospital with critical injuries and four people are receiving care for moderate to minor injuries. Medical personnel responded immediately and the UC Santa Cruz Police Department is investigating.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Our thoughts and hearts are with our students and our employee, and all of their families and friends during this difficult time. We are working to provide support for those affected by this collision and hoping for a complete recovery. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>The collision has caused damage to the lime kiln and there could be structural issues. We ask everyone to avoid the area to prevent injury.&#160;</span></p>

We have been working on the implementation of the third year of the program. The details of the program have been updated for this year; the eligibility criteria remains the same as our first and second year implementation. The effective date for biweekly paid employees is December 24, 2023 and the effective date for monthly paid employees is January 1, 2024. The following outlines the details of the program and the changes to this year&#8217;s model.</p>
<p><strong>Program Overview and Objectives</strong><br/>The non-represented staff salary equity program will augment other campus salary programs such as annual increases and other equity adjustments. The purpose of this program is to bring employee salaries closer to the market (50th percentile of salary range) over a three-year timeline.&#160;</p>
<p>In all three years, the program prioritizes employees who are furthest below the midpoint of their respective Career Tracks salary ranges. Equity amounts for eligible employees will vary depending on individual pay circumstances.&#160;</p>
<p>The two main factors for consideration are an employee&#8217;s penetration in their respective Career Tracks salary range and the number of years in their current classification. Salary range penetration is a point between 0% and 100% indicating specifically where an employee&#8217;s salary falls within their salary range. Due to differences across employees in these two factors, not all employees will receive the same equity increase, and not every employee will receive an increase. This year, the model measures the same criteria, but shifts from providing percentage increases to providing fixed dollar increases. The model will derive the same dollar increase, rather than percentage increase, for employees who fall within the same prioritization group.</p>
<p>In our third year, every non-represented staff member below the 75th percentile in pay grades 15 - 25 is eligible for salary adjustment consideration.The six highest salary grades (26-31) are only eligible for the program if they are below the 25th percentile.&#160;</p>
<p>Salary increases will range from 0.01% to 4.25% of annual pay with the average around 1.22%. About 84% of the non-represented staff will receive an equity adjustment in the third year of the program. Based on program parameters, 60% of the funds will be distributed to employees at or below the 25th percentile and 35% of the funds will be distributed to employees at or above the 25th percentile and below the 50th percentile. Approximately 97% of the $1.5 million will be distributed to employees in grades 15 through 25, approximately 3% of the funds will be distributed to the employees in grades 26 through 31 who are below the 25th percentile.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Non-represented career, partial-year career and contract employees</li>
<li aria-level="1">Employees who have a &#8220;Met Expectations&#8221; performance rating or above for 2022/23 (if an evaluation was not completed, &#8220;Met Expectations&#8221; is assumed)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Employees hired <strong>before</strong> November 1, 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined with the traditional merit or general increase and traditional equities, this special program is designed to accelerate our progress towards a market-based compensation environment.&#160;</p>
<p>Eligible employees will be informed of their increases starting the week January 8, 2024.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawai&#8217;i operates the two most powerful optical telescopes on the Earth. They were jointly constructed by University of California and Caltech, entering science operations in 1993. UC scientists have used the telescopes ever since to make transformative discoveries.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California Observatories Director Bruce Macintosh said &#8220;Connecting the observatories with the people of islands, making sure we truly benefit the community there, is by far the most important task for astronomy in Hawai&#8217;i and California. Rich is the perfect person to bring us together. He&#8217;s also an outstanding leader who cares for and uplifts the people he works with, he has decades of knowledge and experience in how the Keck telescopes operate. He&#8217;s perfect for the job. It will be a privilege to work with him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Keck Observatory Board&#8217;s Search Committee, co-chaired by Macintosh and by the California Institute of Technology&#8217;s (Caltech) Professor of Astronomy Lynne Hillenbrand, led the search for a director; many distinguished and accomplished candidates put forth applications for the position.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We undertook a formal, international search to ensure our hiring process for this prestigious appointment would find the best candidates and be fair and equitable, and in the end, we are wholly confident that Rich Matsuda is the best-qualified executive to lead this institution forward,&#8221; said George R. Blumenthal, Board Chair and Chancellor Emeritus, University of California at Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matsuda is the first Hawai&#699;i-born director of the Keck observatory. He is well-respected in both the astronomical community and the community at large in Hawai&#699;i. He serves as the Maunakea Observatories&#8217; representative to the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority. He has been instrumental in efforts to help the Hawai&#699;i astronomy community foster and strengthen community relationships during the 2019 protest movement and beyond. He is a key figure in collaborating with community members, working together to forge a new path forward based on the principles of mutual stewardship for Maunakea.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His career at Keck Observatory began 30 years ago with the construction of the Keck II telescope. He is kama&#699;&#257;ina to Hawai&#699;i, locally born and raised, and has served in an executive leadership role at the Observatory since 2016. Before assuming the role of interim director of the Observatory in May 2023, Matsuda served as Keck Observatory&#8217;s chief of operations for five years, as well as associate director of external relations. His leadership team includes Dr. John O&#8217;Meara, deputy director and chief scientist, who will continue to serve as a close colleague and collaborator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the support of our Board of Directors, our Observatory has been making a pivot for the last several years, turning toward a new paradigm of mutuality with and for our community. During my tenure as director, my commitment is that our operations, our technical capabilities, and our potential for astronomical discovery will continue to be world-class, and will be even stronger because our work is rooted firmly here in Hawai&#699;i, connected deeply to the community and the culture of this place,&#8221; said Matsuda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matsuda succeeds Hilton Lewis, the previous Keck Observatory director who stepped down in April 2023 after a 37-year career at the Observatory, including nine years as director. &#160;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food insecurity affects the lives of many across Santa Cruz County, including UCSC students. One in three residents of Santa Cruz County reported food insecurity in 2022. Second Harvest Food Bank helps combat that insecurity by reaching 65,000 people across the county each month and relies heavily on volunteers to do so.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has partnered with the Second Harvest Food Bank to help alleviate food insecurity, participating in</span><a href="https://app.giveffect.com/teams/20921-uc-santa-cruz"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holiday food drives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and coordinating volunteer efforts. Of the 1,896 people who </span><a href="https://www.thefoodbank.org/volunteer-trial/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">volunteer with Second Harvest Food Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Santa Cruz County, many are UCSC retirees.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilse Lopes, the former director of Physical Plant at UCSC up until 2008 and an active member with the university&#8217;s Retirees Association, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has both given her time and money to support the food bank. She highly recommends the experience for those looking to give their time to a worthy cause this holiday season.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In her time as a volunteer, Lopes would work in teams to help sort food into baskets for families in need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The organization is filling an important role in our community," Lopes said. &#8220;It is rewarding to be part of a solution to local food insecurity efforts. We live in an expensive area, and many families are not able to support their families without the help of Second Harvest.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closer to home, Second Harvest Food Bank supplies resources that are used in UCSC food pantries across campus. 3,174 students visited the Redwood Free Market one or more times in the 2022-23 academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Lopes has chosen to give monetary donations to Second Harvest rather than volunteer her time. Through the food bank&#8217;s purchasing power, they are able to provide three meals for every $1 donated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual </span><a href="https://app.giveffect.com/teams/20921-uc-santa-cruz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday Food and Fund Drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted by Second Harvest Food Bank has a goal of raising $1.5 million by Jan. 15, 2024. UCSC partners with Second Harvest Food Bank annually to raise funds for those in need. One hundred percent of funds raised go towards food distribution in Santa Cruz County. This year, UCSC&#8217;s efforts are bolstered by a $50,000 matching gift from Tibi McCann and Eric Jensen. So, any donation made via UCSC is effectively doubled!

Mijin Cha testifies before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies J. Mijin Cha testified during a </span><a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=415260"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources on Dec. 12, to discuss energy poverty and share her insights on solutions that could make electricity more affordable for low-income families across America. During her testimony, Cha recommended a three-pronged approach.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To address the root causes of energy poverty, we must, one, reintroduce the ban on oil exports and expand it to include a ban on fracked gas exports to keep oil and gas extracted in the U.S. in the U.S.; second, we must expand current federal assistance programs that provide assistance to struggling households, such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP); and third, we must plan for and advance a managed decline of fossil fuel extraction and use,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cha had been invited to testify on </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5482/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.R. 5482</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bill introduced by Rep. Harriet Hageman, R&#8211;Wyo., The proposed bill would commission a report to congress on issues of energy affordability, require estimates of how any future bills or resolutions related to federal management of energy resources might affect household energy costs, and impose new limits on how federal agencies can manage land and energy resources, especially fossil fuels.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the bill would require that, before federal agencies can make any decisions about energy resource extraction, pipelines, or transmission, they must undertake additional studies at the request of companies or others who want to develop the energy resources. These studies would focus specifically on any possible benefits of the proposed project for energy costs or jobs but would not include any negative consequences, such as increased localized pollution or greenhouse gas emissions released.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In opening remarks for the legislative session, Subcommittee Chairman Pete Stauber, R-Minn., said the bill is part of an &#8220;all of the above&#8221; energy development agenda being pushed by Republicans that he believes will &#8220;help increase domestic energy production and reduce energy costs for American families.&#8221; He blamed rising energy costs on the Biden Administration and said the bill is an effort to &#8220;hold this administration responsible for their policies that are raising energy costs and burdening at-risk communities across our country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subcommittee Ranking Member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., questioned the bill&#8217;s logic during her opening remarks, pointing out that home energy costs in the U.S. have continued to go up at a time when American oil and gas production is at a record high. She said the bill&#8217;s requirements for federal agencies to produce &#8220;one-sided&#8221; benefits reports that don&#8217;t consider costs or risks is intended to slow down any federal efforts to transition away from fossil fuels, and she accused the bill of &#8220;exploiting the language of poverty in order to enrich private oil and gas interests.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her testimony, Cha commended the committee for recognizing the importance of energy poverty, citing U.S. Energy Information Administration data from 2020, which found that roughly one-third of U.S. households struggled to pay their energy bills or kept their homes at unsafe temperatures because of cost concerns. But, she told the committee that the proposed bill&#8217;s specific focus on increasing fossil fuel production &#8220;is counter to combating energy poverty.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cha said that since 2015&#8212;when Congress repealed a ban on crude oil exports that had been in place for 40 years&#8212;the U.S. has become a net exporter of petroleum. Exports of both </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-118#:&#126;:text=With%20U.S.%20crude%20oil%20production,of%20U.S.%20crude%20oil%20worldwide."><span style="font-weight: 400;">crude oil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/IIF_LNG/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">liquified natural gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (of which the U.S. is also a net exporter) have been found to result in increased domestic costs, because exports tie prices to global markets, rather than just domestic demand. For this reason, Cha says the bill&#8217;s focus exclusively on increased energy production &#8220;does nothing to reduce energy prices,&#8221; but ending exports of these resources could actually reduce domestic costs and &#8220;ensure American resources benefit Americans.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, energy bill payment assistance programs, like LIHEAP, and home energy efficiency improvement programs, like WAP, tackle the issue of energy poverty far more directly, Cha explained. Energy efficiency gains from weatherization can reduce heating bills by up to 30%, and bill assistance through LIHEAP &#8220;could be a lifeline for all families in need,&#8221; she said. But at current funding levels, LIHEAP can only serve about a third of the households that are eligible for the program.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If cost is a concern, expansion of LIHEAP and WAP could be funded by repealing the tax credits and subsidies that oil and gas industries receive,&#8221; Cha recommended. &#8220;Conservative estimates calculate that oil and gas companies currently receive $20 billion a year in financial subsidies. These subsidies dwarf the amount allocated to LIHEAP: currently just $3.6 billion for the fiscal year 2024.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cha also advised the subcommittee to keep sight of the fact that climate change, which is primarily driven by the use of fossil fuels, is ultimately the biggest threat to the health and safety of low-income communities. Heat and extreme weather events tied to climate change can also increase home energy demand&#8212;resulting in higher bills&#8212;and can damage electricity grids, leading to blackouts and instability in electricity service that puts all Americans at risk. For all of these reasons and more, Cha said the U.S. must phase out the extraction and use of fossil fuels, and H.R. 5482 runs counter to that goal.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis, we must have a managed and orderly decline of fossil fuel extraction and use,&#8221; she concluded. &#8220;A timeline with set production reduction targets and resources for transition will provide stability and certainty for markets to adapt and provide stability and certainty for workers and communities.&#8221;

href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/action-collaborative-on-transforming-trajectories-for-women-of-color-in-tech">Action Collaborative on transforming trajectories for women of color in tech</a> which was launched by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and 35 other institutions representing higher education, national laboratories, and government.<br/><br/>Through the Action Collaborative, the various organizations will work together to improve pathways in tech education and participation in the tech workforce for women who identify as African American, Black, Hispanic, Latina, Native American, Asian American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. The effort will be guided by the National Academies&#8217; report Transforming Trajectories for Women of Color in Tech, which provides evidence-based findings and recommendations for increasing recruitment, retention, and advancement of women of color in tech fields.<br/><br/>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stress enough how important it is for our students to see themselves in the faculty who teach them, in technology as in all fields,&#8221; said Lori Kletzer, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor. &#8220;Women and people of color continue to face barriers that limit their academic pursuits and careers in technology. At UC Santa Cruz, diversity is a core campus value at the heart of everything we do. Our membership in the Action Collaborative will further strengthen this priority.&#8221;<br/><br/>Sri Kurniawan, Professor of Computational Media at the Baskin School of Engineering, is serving as UCSC&#8217;s senior faculty lead for this effort. As a founding member of the Action Collaborative, UCSC has already committed to four years of membership.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;UCSC has a significant role to play in the new Action Collaborative as a founding member,&#8221; Kurniawan said. &#8220;I look forward to working with this dedicated group to brainstorm and develop meaningful practices that enable all women of color in tech on our campus, from undergraduate students to upper administration, to advance in their careers. I&#8217;m also excited to share data, resources, and best practices developed here at UCSC with our partner institutions.&#8221;<br/><br/>The Action Collaborative is focused on collecting and analyzing data about the experiences of women of color in tech at all stages of their academic and professional journeys and implementing strategies of support such as mentorship programs and professional development opportunities. The members will also work to build alliances with community organizations, technology companies, and advocacy groups to leverage resources and expertise.<br/><br/>The group will offer a platform for the exchange of ideas and promising practices, taking an intersectional approach that recognizes the multifaceted nature of barriers shaped by race, gender, and other factors.<br/>&#8232;&#8220;At Baskin Engineering we have long recognized the challenges and barriers facing people from communities historically excluded from engineering. Joining the Action Collaborative gives us another opportunity to understand and advance the success of women of color in tech fields,&#8221; said Alexander Wolf, Dean of the Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;With sustained dedication and cross-sector engagement, this initiative will enable us to make data and experience-driven decisions to dismantle existing structural barriers and create a future where all women can thrive in tech.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;In addition to capturing the perspectives of our students and faculty, we feel it will be crucial also to capture the perspectives and lived experiences of our female-identifying technical staff, many of whom identify with communities of color,&#8221; said Abigail Kaun, who is serving as the UCSC senior staff lead for the Action Collaborative.<br/><br/>Institutions interested in joining or learning more about the action collaborative can contact Jeena Thomas, director of the action collaborative, at JMThomas@nas.edu.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8842d760807270461b5c85dd974aa934"><name>in-memoriam-peggy-downes-baskin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Scholar, philanthropist Peggy Downes Baskin dies at 93</title><summary>Peggy Downes Baskin, educator and scholar, advocate for women’s rights, and longtime philanthropic supporter of UC Santa Cruz, died at her home surrounded by her family on Dec. 11.

She was 93.</p>
<p>Baskin was renowned for her courage and generosity of spirit. She supported and advanced UC Santa Cruz in numerous ways. She shared her expertise with students as a senior lecturer in feminist studies and supported efforts to promote a diverse and inclusive expansion of opportunities in STEM fields and increase educational equity in the Monterey Bay region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peggy Downes Baskin&#8217;s deep support for and involvement with UC Santa Cruz has been transformative for our community,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;She understood and appreciated what makes our campus so special, and built on that foundation. I am deeply grateful for her contributions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baskin and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/01/jack-baskin-in-memoriam.html">her late husband, Jack</a>, established the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation in 2008 to provide financial support for gender equality and increased access to education for marginalized communities in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. UC Santa Cruz and the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation have worked together to advance innovative and impactful scholarship for many years.</p>
<p>The foundation funded the Baskin Feminist Scholars Program and the Baskin Scholars Program in Engineering to support the transfer of community college students to UC Santa Cruz; supported the Center for Racial Justice; underwrote fellowships to female doctoral students in engineering; and funded the summer Girls in Engineering program.</p>
<p>Alexander Wolf, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, noted that it was Peggy&#8217;s vision to guide more girls to enter engineering that inspired the Girls in Engineering program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 600 middle school students, mostly low-income and first-generation, have been served by the program over the years, and many have gone on to become engineers,&#8221; Wolf said. &#8220;We will continue Peggy&#8217;s legacy of lifting up girls by opening the door to engineering to middle school girls each summer here at UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2016, the foundation established the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/05/bettina-feminist-chair.html">Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation Presidential Chair for Feminist Studies</a>, which funds research and teaching, as well as provides support for graduate fellowships. Distinguished Professor Bettina Aptheker, Baskin&#8217;s close friend for over four decades, was the first chairholder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peggy was not only a generous philanthropist who contributed significantly to Feminist Studies,&#8221; Aptheker said, &#8220;she was also a very gifted teacher who believed passionately in mentoring and encouraging young women to take on leadership roles in communities, especially politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gift from Jack Baskin to honor Baskin and her interests established the <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/peggy-downs-baskin-ethics-lecture-series/?sf_action=get_data&amp;sf_data=results&amp;_sft_project-year=past">Peggy Downes Baskin Humanities Endowment for Interdisciplinary Studies in Ethics</a>, informally known as the Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture. Luminaries such as Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison, Ezra Klein, and Aptheker are among the series' past speakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to Peggy&#8217;s brilliance and determination throughout her life, our campus community will continue to deepen our commitment to feminism and ethics,&#8221; said Jasmine Alinder, dean of the Humanities division. &#8220;Her legacy at UC Santa Cruz will impact our students and faculty for generations to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baskin was born in Seattle in 1930. She attended Vassar College where she graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1952.</p>
<p>Later in life, Baskin expanded her higher education and attended the Claremont Graduate School of Public Policy, where she received a Ph.D. in the early 1980s. She went on to work as a postdoctoral research associate at UC Berkeley, and for 18 years was a professor of political science at Santa Clara University, specializing in the study of the United States presidency, elections, and presidential management styles.</p>
<p>She spent five years at UC Santa Cruz as a senior lecturer on women and politics and women in power.</p>
