Scientists from the COSMOS-Web program have released mosaic images taken in early January by JWST&#8217;s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).</p>
<p>COSMOS-Web aims to map the earliest structures of the universe and will create a wide and deep survey of up to 1 million galaxies. Over the course of 255 hours of observing time, COSMOS-Web will map 0.6 square degrees of the sky with NIRCam, roughly the size of three full moons, and 0.2 square degrees with MIRI.</p>
<p>&#8220;COSMOS-Web provides an unparalleled, wide-angle view of the distant universe with JWST,&#8221; said Brant Robertson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the COSMOS-Web Management Committee. "By surveying such a large area on the sky, we can finally begin to untangle how the formation of galaxies is influenced by their cosmic environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>COSMOS-Web has three primary science goals: furthering our understanding of the Reionization Era, roughly 200,000 to 1 billion years after the Big Bang; identifying and characterizing early massive galaxies in the first two billion years; and studying how dark matter has evolved with the stellar content of galaxies. COSMOS-Web is the widest area JWST will observe in its first year, enabling the study of galaxies across a wide range of local environments. The images taken so far show incredible detail when compared with those taken previously by other observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredibly exciting to get the first data from the telescope for COSMOS-Web,&#8221; said principal investigator Jeyhan Kartaltepe, an associate professor at Rochester Institute of Technology. &#8220;Everything worked beautifully, and the data are even better than we expected. We&#8217;ve been working really hard to produce science quality images to use for our analysis and this is just a drop in the bucket of what&#8217;s to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mosaics were created from six pointings of the telescope taken January 5 and 6. The telescope will take 77 pointings, roughly half the field, in April, and the remaining 69 pointings are scheduled to take place in December 2023 and January 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;JWST has delivered such stunning images of this region that sources are literally popping out in every small patch of the observed sky,&#8221; said Santosh Harish, a postdoctoral research associate at RIT. &#8220;What were thought to be compact objects based on the best images we had so far, the JWST observations are now able to resolve these objects into multiple components, and in some cases even reveal the complex morphology of these extragalactic sources. With these first observations, we have just barely scratched the surface of what is to come with the completion of this program, next year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Electrons in graphene (an atomically thin form of carbon) behave as if they were massless, like photons, which are massless particles of light. Although graphene electrons do not move at the speed of light, they exhibit the same energy-momentum relationship as photons and can be described as &#8220;ultra-relativistic.&#8221; When these electrons are confined in a quantum dot, they travel at high velocity in circular loops around the edge of the dot.</p>
<p>&#8220;These current loops create magnetic moments that are very sensitive to external magnetic fields,&#8221; explained Jairo Velasco Jr., associate professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The sensitivity of these current loops stems from the fact that graphene electrons are ultra-relativistic and travel at high velocity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Velasco is a corresponding author of a paper on the new findings, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-023-01327-0">published March 6 in <em>Nature Nanotechnology</em></a>. His group at UC Santa Cruz used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to create the quantum dots in graphene and study their properties. His collaborators on the project include scientists at the University of Manchester, U.K., and the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was highly collaborative work,&#8221; Velasco said. &#8220;We did the measurements in my lab at UCSC, and then we worked very closely with theoretical physicists at the University of Manchester to understand and interpret our data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unique optical and electrical properties of quantum dots&#8212;which are often made of semiconductor nanocrystals&#8212;are due to electrons being confined within a nanoscale structure such that their behavior is governed by quantum mechanics. Because the resulting electronic structure is like that of atoms, quantum dots are often called &#8220;artificial atoms.&#8221; Velasco&#8217;s approach creates quantum dots in different forms of graphene using an electrostatic &#8220;corral&#8221; to confine graphene&#8217;s speeding electrons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of what makes this interesting is the fundamental physics of this system and the opportunity to study atomic physics in the ultra-relativistic regime,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the same time, there are interesting potential applications for this as a new type of quantum sensor that can detect magnetic fields at the nano scale with high spatial resolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additional applications are also possible, according to co-first author Zhehao Ge, a UCSC graduate student in physics. &#8220;The findings in our work also indicate that graphene quantum dots can potentially host a giant persistent current (a perpetual electric current without the need of an external power source) in a small magnetic field,&#8221; Ge said. &#8220;Such current can potentially be used for quantum simulation and quantum computation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study looked at quantum dots in both monolayer graphene and twisted bilayer graphene. The graphene rests on an insulating layer of hexagonal boron nitride, and a voltage applied with the STM tip creates charges in the boron nitride that serve to electrostatically confine electrons in the graphene.</p>
<p>Although Velasco&#8217;s lab uses STM to create and study graphene quantum dots, a simpler system using metal electrodes in a cross-bar array could be used in a magnetic sensor device. Because graphene is highly flexible, the sensor could be integrated with flexible substrates to enable magnetic field sensing of curved objects.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have many quantum dots in an array, and this could be used to measure magnetic fields in living organisms, or to understand how the magnetic field is distributed in a material or a device,&#8221; Velasco said.</p>
<p>The co-first authors of the paper are Zhehao Ge, a graduate student in Velasco&#8217;s lab at UCSC, and Sergey Slizovskiy at the University of Manchester. Vladimir Fal&#8217;ko at the University of Manchester is a corresponding author, and the other coauthors include Peter Polizogopoulos, Toyanath Joshi, and David Lederman at UC Santa Cruz, and Takashi Taniguchi and Kenji Watanabe at the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan.

When plants get wet they are at risk of contracting diseases as pathogens germinate and grow on the surfaces of their leaves. By measuring how long a particular type of plant&#8217;s leaves stay wet, farmers, gardeners, and researchers can improve disease forecasting, making better decisions about management strategy.<br/><br/>Commercial leaf wetness sensors exist, but are not able to provide an estimate that is specific to any particular type of plant, and so are often inaccurate. But through a collaborative effort, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Marco Rolandi, Professor of Environmental Studies Gregory Gilbert, and former electrical engineering graduate student Brian Nguyen have found a solution to this problem: a simple biomimetic sensor that replicates the surface traits and water resistance of actual leaves of any plant to provide a highly accurate measurement of leaf wetness.&#160;<br/><br/>These novel custom sensors are fairly inexpensive to produce and can be used to study any crop, horticultural plant, or wild species. This research was described in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adsr.202200033">a new paper</a> in Advanced Sensor Research, a leading journal for sensor engineering.&#160;<br/><br/>The longer a leaf stays wet, the more likely it is to develop disease, as plant pathogens germinate and initiate infection after several continuous hours of moisture. But with more accurate disease forecasting, better management strategies can be applied to reduce crop loss, improve irrigation techniques, and limit the release of unnecessary pesticides into the environment.<br/><br/>&#8220;The better the disease forecasting models are, the better it is for the environment, for people working on the farms, for the farmers economically, and for consumers,&#8221; said Gilbert, who has been studying plant pathogens for decades.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The new technology uses a biomimetic approach to replicate the specific and widely variable surface properties of any leaf. There are different factors that play into how long a leaf stays wet, including its shape, angle, texture, and its hydrophobicity &#8212; how easily the plant repels water. Plants have developed traits to prevent water from accumulating on their leaves in order to stave off disease and allow for the exchange of gas that enables photosynthesis and other important functions of the plant.&#160;<br/><br/>The new sensors address all of these factors that play into leaf wetness. They use a silicone polymer to create a mold that replicates the surface properties of the leaf of interest, such as shape, size, and texture. Additionally, they adjust the ratio of ingredients in the silicone used for each replica plant surface, so that hydrophobicity of the replica leaf matches that of the leaf of interest.&#160;<img alt="leaf-sensor_300.png" class="" height="300" src="images/leaf-sensor_300.png" width="765"/><br/><br/>&#8220;The idea is that we try to mimic nature,&#8221; Rolandi said. &#8220;We are trying to make our sensor as similar as possible to the real plant.&#8221;<br/><br/>The replica leaf surface is then placed on top of a humidity sensor &#8211; a chip designed for this task &#8211; so that now the sensor measures the amount of water on the replica leaf rather than just the flat surface of the typical sensor.&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers tested their replication technology with three different types of leaves with varying surface properties from plants found on the UCSC campus: a California bay (which is often an important host of the pathogen that causes the devastating Sudden Oak Disease), a sycamore, and an escallonia. These tests showed that the new biomimetic sensors were able to provide a much more accurate measurement of how long the leaves stayed wet, proving their technology to be useful.&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers envision that their simple sensing solution made from relatively cheap parts could easily be brought to market and used by farmers to manage the crops they grow. Beyond just commercial farms, they imagine that this technology can be useful on smaller and organic farms as a useful and inexpensive addition to their existing rain and temperature monitoring systems.&#160;<br/><br/>Next, the researchers hope to deploy their technology in the field, both on the farm at UC Santa Cruz and with local farmers. Gilbert hopes that the sensors can also be used to study disease forecasting in wild ecosystems, especially as the changing climate makes it all the more important to understand shifts in moisture temperature, timing, and amount.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;That's going to change the kinds of diseases that we see developing everywhere,&#8221; Gilbert said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a really important time to be studying this.&#8221;<br/><br/>Rolandi received funding to work on this project through a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/09/seed-funding.html">seed grant</a> from the UCSC Office of Research in 2020. The researchers are interested in follow-up funding to explore different leaf types, improve accuracy and simplicity, and make production more effective.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a82355ce807270461741bca366111c5d"><name>ramirez-ruiz-aaas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz wins 2023 AAAS Mentor Award</title><summary>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has awarded the 2023 AAAS Mentor Award to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1677830400000</start-date><display-name>Astrophysicist Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz wins 2023 AAAS Mentor Award</display-name><path>/2023/03/ramirez-ruiz-aaas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/ramirez-ruiz-aaas</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1677858133419</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1678146637217</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>student-success</value><value>Astro and Planets</value><value>Diversity</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed><br/><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtoqGKhwguk" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></embed><width>500</width><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>104843</file-size><width>350</width><height>451</height></image><image-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/02/images/ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ramirez-ruiz-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20854</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz (Photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has awarded the 2023 AAAS Mentor Award to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The award recognizes Ramirez-Ruiz for his direct mentoring of students and for the impact of the national program he created. Between the two, Ramirez-Ruiz has reached more than half of the students from minoritized groups who have received a Ph.D. in astronomy in the last five years.</p>
<p>"This award is an extraordinary honor,&#8221; said Ramirez-Ruiz, who holds UCSC&#8217;s Vera Rubin Presidential Chair for Diversity in Astronomy. &#8220;I hope my greatest contribution to science is not any particular discovery, but the creation of a new way of thinking that enables students from racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse families to make their own discoveries."</p>
<p>The AAAS awards for mentoring honor individuals who have mentored significant numbers of underrepresented students and have demonstrated scholarship, activism, and community-building on behalf of underrepresented groups in STEM, as well as impacting the climate of a department, college, or institution to have significantly increased the diversity of students pursuing or completing Ph.D.s in STEM.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz has directly mentored 12 bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s students from underrepresented backgrounds who went on to receive a Ph.D., as well as seven underrepresented students who he mentored through their Ph.D. programs. He has also been a research adviser for more than 200 students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz created a mentoring program at UCSC called <a href="https://lamat.science.ucsc.edu/">Lamat</a> (Mayan for &#8220;star&#8221;), which is now a nationwide program supporting community college students who transfer to four-year institutions and continue on to graduate studies in astronomy. Those reached by the program are disproportionately women and historically marginalized populations&#8212;83% of the 93 participants since the program&#8217;s founding. Lamat has been transformative in increasing the number of historically marginalized students earning Ph.D.s in astrophysics.</p>
<p>In 2022, Ramirez-Ruiz was honored by the White House with a Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. He has also received numerous awards for his research in astrophysics, including the HEAD Mid-Career Prize from the American Astronomical Society, and he is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b860a48e807270461ef31b7631afd1cd"><name>guneet-hora</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Continuing an Academic Legacy</title><summary>The Dr. Aaronette White Scholarship was awarded to  Guneet Hora in 2022.&#13;

UCSC&#8217;s history of student activism and advocacy inspired Hora to follow the university&#8217;s tradition of confronting social issues. By pursuing an education in Intensive Psychology and Legal Studies, Hora aims to raise the mental health of marginalized communities in the face of the impact left by the immigration and justice systems. Hora was awarded the 2022 Dr. Aaronette White Scholarship in recognition of her work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dr. Aaronette White Scholarship is named in tribute to the late Dr. Aaronette White, former associate dean of equity and social responsibility in the Division of Social Sciences. The award honors students who are continuing Dr. White&#8217;s legacy in Social Psychology&#8212;working with an intersectional perspective to show the roots of race, ethnicity, culture, nationality and gender in shaping lived experience. The scholarship awards undergraduate students for their work in Social Psychology, and in preserving and continuing the ethos of Dr. Aaronette White&#8212;an ethos embodied in Hora&#8217;s dedication to activism and psychology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I decided to attend UC Santa Cruz because of the rich history of student activism and advocacy that exists here,&#8221; Hora says, &#8220;I was inspired seeing how students have stood up for themselves and others on important social issues, and wanted to see myself doing the same.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hora is working to remedy injustices of immigration law. As a student, Hora worked at the Davenport Resource Service Center through UCSC, where she provided pro bono legal services to help undocumented immigrants attain immigration services. Hora identifies with a low-income immigrant community and is familiar with the issues immigrants face. Conducting legal research at the Santa Cruz County courthouse to assist a client in a U-VISA immigration case is an experience that continues to resonate with Hora.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The experience was transformative [...] it allowed me to explore my interests in criminal and immigration law, and showed me more about what a career in those fields might look like.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hora aims to continue her studies in graduate school and pursue a Ph.D. in Social Psychology and a J.D. with a focus in immigration law, but beforehand she plans to take a gap year to pursue further research into criminal and human rights law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This scholarship will impact my academic life/research because it will allow me to support myself as I pursue graduate school under a joint program,&#8221; Hora says. &#8220;Identifying with a low-income immigrant community comes with its own unique set of challenges; this scholarship will aid me as I navigate these obstacles.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those following in Hora&#8217;s footsteps, she offers some advice. Just as Hora came to UCSC to join a community and university written in the history of activism, she emphasizes incoming students to prioritize finding and creating connections above all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Form strong connections with your professors and teaching assistants,&#8221; Hora says. &#8220;These connections will undoubtedly help you in your future pursuits, whether that is graduate school, landing a job post-graduation, or another path.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b88929ca807270461ef31b764125ee11"><name>admitted-student-tours</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Notice from Office of Admissions: Admitted Student Tours Beginning April 3 </title><summary>Michelle Whittingham, associate vice chancellor for enrollment management and interim director of undergraduate admissions shares important dates for and upcoming information about upcoming programs and services for newly admitted students.</summary><start-date>1678089600000</start-date><display-name>Notice from Office of Admissions: Admitted Student Tours Beginning April 3 </display-name><path>/2023/03/admitted-student-tours</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/admitted-student-tours</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1678133242296</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1678133242296</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Colleague,</span></p>

Double majoring in linguistics and legal studies, Nicole is excited to continue her research in the Dolores Huerta Research Center of the America&#8217;s Human Rights Investigation Lab.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of the Weiss Family Scholarship, Nicole is entering her third year with the Human Rights Investigation Lab, and is currently working on a thesis looking into human rights abuse cases with a focus on the Americas.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Weiss Family Scholarship was established in 2005 by Timothy and Jean Weiss. The scholarship endowment provides scholarships to support students in </span><a href="http://collegenine.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleges Nine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and John R. Lewis College.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Weiss Family Scholarship enhances the mission of the </span><a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Division of Social Sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research centers, rewarding outstanding students, strengthening student/faculty connections, and providing an additional incentive for the research centers to involve the students within these two Division of Social Sciences residential colleges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC, Nicole hopes to gain more experience in the legal field.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently my pathway forward involves getting my paralegal certification this summer so I can get some work experience in the legal field right after graduation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am planning on returning to academia at some point in the future though, whether as a law student or a graduate student is to be determined.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her fellow students, Nicole offers some advice:&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Explore all of the things! Take classes outside of your major for fun, find your class locations before they start (you can seriously get lost here), go to office hours (your professors and TAs are really cool people), explore the resources on campus (might take a bit of searching but it is worth it), join clubs, take hikes, etc.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b983d6c2807270461ef31b76262556e3"><name>eshraghian-spikegpt</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>SpikeGPT: researcher releases code for largest-ever spiking neural network for language generation</title><summary>Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Jason Eshraghian and two students recently released the open-sourced code for the largest language-generating spiking neural network ever, named SpikeGPT.</summary><start-date>1678176000000</start-date><path>/2023/03/eshraghian-spikegpt</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/eshraghian-spikegpt</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1678149670576</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1678824865166</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/03/images/jason_300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/03/images/jason_300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jason_300.jpg</name><display-name>jason_300.jpg</display-name><file-size>12918</file-size><width>240</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Jason Eshraghian</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/03/images/jason_80.png</path><link>site://news/2023/03/images/jason_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>jason_80.png</name><display-name>jason_80.png</display-name><file-size>16294</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Jason Eshraghian</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Jason Eshraghian</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Language generators such as ChatGPT are gaining attention for their ability to reshape how we use search engines and change the way we interact with artificial intelligence. However, these algorithms are both computationally expensive to run and depend on maintenance from just a few companies to avoid outages.&#160;<br/><br/>But UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Jason Eshraghian created a new model for language generation that can address both of these issues. Language models typically use modern deep learning methods called neural networks, but Eshraghian is powering a language model with an alternative algorithm called a spiking neural network (SNN). He and two students have recently released the <a href="https://huggingface.co/ridger/SpikeGPT-BookCorpus">open-sourced code</a> for the largest language-generating SNN ever, named SpikeGPT, which uses 22 times less energy than a similar model using typical deep learning. Using SNNs for language generation can have huge implications for accessibility, data security, and green computing and energy efficiency within this field.<br/><br/>&#8220;Brains are way more efficient than AI algorithms,&#8221; Eshraghian said. &#8220;Large scale language models rely on ridiculous amounts of compute power, and that&#8217;s pretty damn expensive. We&#8217;re taking an informed approach to borrowing principles from the brain, copying this idea that neurons are usually quiet and not transmitting anything. Using spikes is a much more efficient way to represent information.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Neural networks in general are based on emulating how the brain processes information, and spiking neural networks are a variation that try to make the networks more efficient. Instead of constantly transmitting information throughout the network, as non-spiking networks behave, the neurons in SNNs stay in a quiet state unless they are activated, and therefore spike. This introduces a temporal dimension into the equation, because the functions are concerned with how the neurons behave over time.&#160;<br/><br/>Spiking neural networks, however, face their own challenges in the training of the models. Many of the optimization strategies that have been developed for regular neural networks and modern deep learning, such as backpropagation and gradient descent, cannot be easily applied to the training of SNNs because the information inputted into the system is not compatible with the training techniques. But Eshraghian has pioneered methods to circumvent these problems and apply the optimization techniques developed for traditional deep learning for the training of SNNs.<br/><br/>Large language models, such as ChatGPT, use a technique called self-attention, taking a sequence of data, such as a string of words, and applying a function to determine how closely each data point is related to each other. The mathematics behind this requires matrix-matrix multiplication, a complexity which is computationally expensive.&#160;<br/><br/>When trying to combine self-attention with SNNs, there was a similar complexity problem, until Eshraghian and his incoming graduate student Ruijie Zhu developed a technique to feed each data point in the sequence into the SNN model one by one, eliminating the need to do matrix-matrix multiplication.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;By coming up with a way to break down that backbone of language models into sequences, we completely squashed down that computational complexity without compromising on the ability of the model to generate language,&#8221; Eshraghian said. &#8220;It was taking the best of both worlds &#8211; the low complexity of sequential models and the performance of self-attention.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13939v1">preprint paper</a>, Eshraghian describes three versions of SpikeGPT. The first is the smallest scale, at 45 million parameters, close in size to the largest-ever SNN that had been developed up to this point. Right now Eshraghian has only released the code for this smallest model, and he is still training the two larger ones.&#160;<br/><br/>The medium- and large-size models, at 125 million and 260 million parameters respectively, will likely become the second-largest and largest models when their training is complete and their code is released.&#160;<br/><br/>The preprint shows examples of language generation that these two models were able to produce, even in their not-yet fully trained states. Eshraghian found that his small-scale version is significantly more energy efficient than typical deep-learning models, and expects similar results for the other size models.&#160;<br/><br/>Using SNNs for language generation to power language generation in a more energy-efficient way can mean a decreased dependency on the large companies that currently dominate the language generation field. Making the technology more accessible will mitigate issues such as those that occur when gigantic servers running ChatGPT go down and render the technology useless for a time.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;If we manage to get this low-power enough to function on a scale comparable with the brain, then that could be something that everyone has locally on their devices, with less reliance on some monopolized entity,&#8221; Eshraghian said.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>SpikeGPT also offers huge benefits for data security and privacy. With the language generator on a local device, data imputed into the systems are much more secure, protected from potential data-harvesting enterprises.&#160;<br/><br/>Eshraghian hopes that his models will show the language generation industry the vast potential of SNNs.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This work shows that we can actually train models at the same scale with very similar performance, with far, far better energy consumption than what's currently out there. Showing that in this paper could nudge industry in a direction to be more open to adopting SNNs as a full-fledged technique to address their power-consumption problems.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>However, this transition will require the development of brain-inspired hardware, which is a significant investment. Eshraghian hopes to work with a hardware company such as Intel to host these models, which would allow him to further demonstrate the energy-saving benefits of his SNN.<br/><br/>Since releasing the preprint paper and the code for the SNN, Eshraghian has seen a positive reaction from the research community. Hugging Face, a major company that hosts open-source models that are too large to live on GitHub, offered to host his model. He has also started a Discord server for people to experiment, build chatbots, and share results.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;What's most appreciated by the community is the fact that we&#8217;ve shown it's actually possible to do language generation with spikes.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bd1d1f95807270461ef31b763dcaba17"><name>elise-duffau</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Cultivating equitable communications</title><summary>Elise Duffau was awarded the Frederico and Rena Perlino Memorial Scholarship in 2022.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lorena assumes this new role with extensive experience dating back to 2000 when she started her career at EdFund, the California Student Loan Guarantor as a student loan counselor. Since then, she has held various positions in multiple sectors of higher education which include financial aid analyst at CSU, Monterey Bay. Throughout her tenure in financial aid, she has had the opportunity to work on a variety of financial aid programs with the Department of Education. Her work in financial aid grew to include organizational administration, strategic planning, forecasting, audit management, aid packaging, scholarships, and compliance risk. Lorena&#8217;s passion for financial aid lies in her commitment to making significant contributions to student success, both at the undergraduate and graduate level, as well as her dedication to supporting staff in their professional growth and the important work they provide to our campus, students and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Mexico, Lorena and her family left their country and migrated to the United States when she was fourteen. Her family spent a year in Orange County before moving to South Monterey County where she attended and graduated from Gonzales High School. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her participation in a campus tour her junior year in high school, Lorena found UC Santa Cruz to be her home. She stated &#8220;I had only been in this country for a couple of years and like many immigrants, I looked forward to achieving the American Dream. As I found myself listening to the tour guide describe the campus in the middle of the Cowell courtyard, I knew UC Santa Cruz was the place where I could reach that and many other dreams. I am now a UC Santa Cruz graduate, and privileged to be serving in a position where I can help future SLUGS accomplish their goals.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bdb74fc2807270463958d76958d2661e"><name>lyla-june-event</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Indigenous land management focus of this year’s Conversations on Climate Justice</title><summary>Wildfires.

<p>Yet, there&#8217;s still a lot that can be learned from pre-colonial Indigenous food and land management techniques to combat our current climate problems, according to <a href="https://www.lylajune.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Lyla June Johnston,</a> the keynote speaker for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s third annual <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/event/lyla-june-architects-of-abundance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Conversations on Climate Justice event</a>, coming up this Monday, March 13.</p>
<p>Johnston, who is known in the music world as Lyla June, is an Indigenous musician, scholar, and community organizer of Din&#233; (Navajo), Ts&#233;ts&#234;h&#233;st&#226;hese (Cheyenne), and European lineages. The focus of her upcoming discussion, &#8220;<a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/event/lyla-june-architects-of-abundance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Architects of Abundance: Indigenous Regenerative Food Systems and the Excavation of Hidden History</a>,&#8221; is centered on the findings from Johnston&#8217;s <a href="https://www.lylajune.com/phd-dissertation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ph.D. dissertation</a> exploring how Indigenous Americans gardened the land on bio-regional scales to produce abundant food systems. Her research was also the focus of a September 2022 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH5zJxQETl4&amp;t=171s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TedX talk.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;This has been talked about for 500 years, but the majority of Americans are woefully uneducated on Indigenous land management,&#8221; said Johnston, who holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree in Human Ecology from Stanford University, a master&#8217;s degree from the University of New Mexico in American Indian Education, and a Ph.D. from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, with a focus on Indigenous Pedagogy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about farming or the national park system. It&#8217;s the ways in which native people cultivated the natural food-bearing capacity of the land through controlled burns, floodplain management, soil management, and habitat expansion of key plants and animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through Johnston&#8217;s unique brand of storytelling that combines her lived experience, visuals and music, she will present an &#8220;ocean of solutions that these civilizations have had for today&#8217;s failing systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hybrid event, presented in person at the Merrill Cultural Center and virtually on Zoom from 5-7 p.m. March 13, is co-sponsored by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Institute for Social Transformation</a>, the <a href="https://airc.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">American Indian Resource Center</a>, and the <a href="https://pocsc.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">People of Color Sustainability Collective.</a> The event is also made possible by financial support from the Kamieniecki Lecture Fund Endowment.&#160;</p>
<p>Valentin Lopez, chairman of the <a href="https://amahmutsun.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amah Mutsun Tribal Band,</a> will be providing remarks in context to our local region. The Amah Mutsun Tribal Band are descendants of the Indigenous people taken to Mission Santa Cruz and San Juan Bautista during the brutal colonization of this area. Chairman Lopez is looking forward to sharing Indigenous knowledge and areas of primary concern regarding climate change with the campus community.</p>
<p>&#8220;My hope is that people will recognize the value of the Indigenous perspective with regard to addressing climate change, and take the time to talk more about traditional ways to address these issues,&#8221; said Lopez.</p>
<p>Brook M. Thompson, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental studies, will speak at the event about how Indigenous knowledge can be better implemented into California water policy.</p>
<p>Representatives from the People of Color Sustainability Collective, a collaboration between the Ethnic Resource Centers, College Nine, John R. Lewis College, and the UCSC Sustainability Office that focuses on environmental justice topics through the lens of <a href="https://pocsc.ucsc.edu/about/inclusive-sustainability.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&#8220;inclusive sustainability,&#8221;&#160;</a>believe that students will find a lot of value in the upcoming event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Power is in this deep mentorship and connectivity at these events and the joy in this new wave of environmentalism,&#8221; said Maya Caminada, a senior Anthropology major and a PoCSC intern. &#8220;We want to bring more of this as action and movement.&#8221;</p>

<p>The study, lead-authored by <a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=klseto" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Katherine Seto,</a> an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was published in <em>Science Advances</em> on March 10. It explores the unregulated nature of global squid fisheries across three oceans over a three-year period, and how these fisheries continue to grow and shift locations beyond the jurisdiction of management bodies. The research was conducted through a research partnership between <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Global Fishing Watch</a>, the <a href="https://www.uow.edu.au/ancors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security</a> at the University of Wollongong, and the <a href="https://www.fra.affrc.go.jp/eng/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency</a>.</p>
<p>Using satellite imagery, vessel tracking, and data monitoring, the study found that the fishing conducted by this globalized light-luring squid fishery was extensive, fishing between 149,000-251,000 vessel days annually, and that effort increased 68% over the study period from 2017-2020.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;These squid fisheries are highly mobile, fishing multiple oceans within a given year,&#8221; said Seto. &#8220;While some conservation and management measures are in place to regulate this type of fishing, our research found that actors may take advantage of these fragmented regulations to maximize resource extraction. To address this, we need to address the factors that promote the growth and expansion of fishing efforts, and increase data sharing and communication between management entities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study found that these squid fishing vessels fished largely (86%) in unregulated areas, equating to 4.4 million total hours of fishing time between 2017-2020. While unregulated fishing is not necessarily illegal, it presents challenges for fisheries sustainability and resource equity, and has been connected to questionable human rights and labor practices.&#160;</p>
<p>"By synthesizing data from multiple sources, we created a robust picture of the fishing activity of the high seas squid fleets. Our analysis highlights the interconnectedness of fishing grounds used by the fleets,&#8221; said Nate Miller, head of applied research at Global Fishing Watch and co-author of the study. &#8220;It demonstrates the critical importance of comprehensive data sharing agreements between regional bodies for improving understanding of the movements of these vessels and quantifying their impacts on squid stocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>One major challenge has been the vessels freely fishing between regulated and unregulated spaces, fishing huge amounts of squid with little to no oversight or data reporting. Fishing in unregulated areas has also steadily increased and seems to be preferred despite concerns over stock status, according to the study.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;These unregulated fishing activities require urgent action. They occur in our global commons, shared by all, yet few receive any benefit, and neighboring coastal States are increasingly concerned regarding the impact on their own shared fish stocks,&#8221; said study co-author Quentin Hanich, from the University of Wollongong.&#160;</p>
<p>Masanori Miyahara, a co-author and advisor to the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, agrees.</p>
<p>&#8220;These catches are often not reported to domestic or international management bodies, nor are they incorporated into estimates of fishing effort, harvest, or stock status,&#8221; said Miyahara. &#8220;While it is good to see both the North Pacific Fisheries Commission and the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation strengthen their management, urgent responses are also required in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans to ensure that fleets do not simply evade regulation by moving elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we experience an increased demand for seafood products globally, we must understand the factors that facilitate the increase and expansion of fishing efforts to address the challenges of unregulated fishing, according to the study.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like all activities in the global commons, fishing on the high seas should be fully regulated. Yet the regional bodies with the competence to adopt management measures are restrained by a handful of states whose self-interests are best served when such activities are unregulated or done with few limits,&#8221; said Osvaldo Urrutia S., professor of international law at Pontificia Universidad Cat&#243;lica de Valpara&#237;so in Chile. &#8220;The global squid fishery shows how important it is to strengthen regional management of high seas resources and to continue international calls for states and regional bodies to take this challenge seriously.&#8221;</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April Yee is passionate about helping others.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A longtime certified life coach, April has helped countless individuals discover their passions, paths, and goals. She says that her job is extremely rewarding, but early on, her career had started on an entirely different path.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 2002 with two degrees in psychology and American studies, April began working in venture capital and private equity. After 7 years in San Francisco, her company offered her the opportunity to move to New York. After she relocated, she found herself working 14-hour days, taking on massive workloads, and not knowing how to set boundaries. By her third year in New York, she experienced burnout&#8212;which quickly escalated into health issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My body was affected by the stress that I was carrying,&#8221; April said. &#8220;My health declined, and I got sick and needed emergency open heart surgery. After the surgery, I was recovering and felt like I didn&#8217;t know how to be in the world anymore because a lot of what my identity was attached to was being able to work hard, work long hours, and do whatever it takes.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After having an affirming and empowering experience in therapy, April decided she wanted to do what she could to help others experiencing burnout and work-related stress. This desire to help others led April to earn two life coaching certifications and begin her new career as a life coach. She emphasizes that fellow Banana Slugs are more than welcome to </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprilyeehlc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reach out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to her if they are seeking coaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, April began looking for a way to connect back to her alma mater and joined the <a href="#https://alumni.ucsc.edu/about/council/seeking-councilors.html">UCSC Alumni Council</a>.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had such a great experience at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; April says. &#8220;I wanted to give back and contribute whatever talents or skills I have to the Council to continue to help the campus be an environment where students can thrive, learn, and grow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her role as a councilor, April occasionally hosts mindfulness sessions at UCSC-related meetings and events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She says she is grateful for her experience with the Alumni Council and had the opportunity to make many meaningful connections with a diverse group of councilors, support current students, and give back to the campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I definitely recommend joining the Alumni Council to anyone involved on campus or anyone who enjoyed their experience at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; April says. &#8220;Especially people who felt like they received a lot from attending UCSC and want to give their time, energy, and effort to continuing to make sure the campus exists for other students to learn, thrive, and grow.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Attending UC Santa Cruz</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April knew she had chosen the right university when she stepped onto campus for the first time in 1998. She immediately fell in love with the campus&#8217;s natural beauty and soon joined many organizations and assumed leadership roles.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1999, the Asian American and Pacific Islander Resource Center had its grand opening, and April became one of the center&#8217;s first-ever student workers. She said the center gave her plentiful opportunities for leadership and growth, and she worked there until graduating in 2002.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That gave me a lot of opportunity for leadership and growth,&#8221; April says. &#8220;From being involved with student organizations on campus to being so involved with the Alumni Council, it&#8217;s sort of an extension of the work, activity, and leadership that I did as a student. And so, it&#8217;s been really rewarding to continue that.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Councilors are volunteer leaders who collaborate with UCSC staff to communicate with and engage over 140,000 alumni, support student success, advocate for UCSC, fundraise to support campus initiatives, and ensure the alumni voice as part of UCSC&#8217;s culture and future. In addition, the Council manages endowments that sponsor student scholarships, college experiential learning programs, and support student projects.</span></p>

<p>The reproductive success of female elephant seals depends on their ability to find prey and put on weight during their months-long foraging migrations. Researchers at UC Santa Cruz studied the relationships between elephant seal behavioral strategies in the open ocean, weight gain, and lifetime success at producing pups.</p>
<p>Their findings, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.14193">published March 8 in <em>Ecology Letters</em></a>, reveal a sharp threshold in the relationship between mass gain and pup production, suggesting a physiological tipping point at which insufficient mass gain leads to reproductive failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that diving deeper during foraging allowed the females to gain more mass, and gaining more mass led to a marginal increase in their chances of survival and a massive increase in the number of pups they produced in a lifetime,&#8221; said corresponding author Roxanne Beltran, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Beltran&#8217;s team used 25 years of data collected by the long-running UCSC elephant seal research program at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve to investigate the influence of behavioral strategies and foraging success on survival and reproduction in female northern elephant seals. Biologgers carried by the seals recorded their activities during the months-long migrations, including where the seals went and the depth of their dives, while data collected on the beach at A&#241;o Nuevo told researchers which animals survived, how much weight they gained, and how many pups they had over their lifetime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conceptually it makes sense that an individual would have to gain enough energy to survive and reproduce, but we were able to demonstrate how entwined these are and suggest when survival may be prioritized over reproduction,&#8221; said co-first author Keith Hernandez, who worked on the study as a postdoctoral scholar in Beltran&#8217;s lab at UCSC and is now at Oregon State University.</p>
<p>Female elephant seals give birth annually to a single pup in winter. They spend four weeks on the beach nursing their pup, relying entirely on stored energy until they can wean the pup and return to the ocean to feed. After the winter breeding season, they head out to sea for two months before returning to the colony to molt. Then they leave on a long post-molting migration, traveling thousands of miles across the North Pacific Ocean over seven to eight months.</p>
<p>Individual seals pursue different strategies during these foraging trips, going different distances from the coast, diving to different depths, and targeting different prey (various species of fish and squid). The researchers found that dive depth was the strongest predictor of mass gain. Deeper diving seals migrated farther from the coast and had more energy-rich diets than shallower diving seals.</p>
<p>The resulting mass gain directly affects a seal&#8217;s ability to produce a pup. A female that doesn&#8217;t put on enough weight won&#8217;t give birth to a pup after she returns to the beach. The threshold is around 205 kilograms (450 pounds): animals that gained less than that rarely pupped, while those gaining more than 260 kilograms (573 pounds) almost always pupped.</p>
<p>Survival also depends on putting on weight, and the longer a female lives the more pups she can produce. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/supermoms.html">Previous research</a> has shown that in the long run, a relatively small number of long-lived female elephant seals produce most of the pups in the colony. These &#8220;supermoms&#8221; may live as long as 23 years and produce more than 15 pups in their lifetimes, while most females don&#8217;t live nearly as long and produce many fewer pups. The strategies that allow these moms to be so successful, however, have long been a mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We discovered that an additional 5 percent of foraging success led to a 300 percent increase in lifetime pup production due to the effects of mass gain on both survival and giving birth and raising a pup each year,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;These findings tell us which strategies allow these long-lived mammals to succeed at their most important job, which is to stay alive and contribute to the next generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also provides a framework for studying demographic trends in other species, Hernandez said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Determining the relationship between foraging success, survival, and reproductive success can inform effective management practices once we understand the critical periods in an animal&#8217;s annual cycle,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The northern elephant seal population is currently doing quite well, increasing by about 4 percent each year, after being hunted to near extinction in the 19th century. At the same time, however, their ocean environment is changing due to climate change, and the fishing industry is exploring the potential of the deep &#8220;mesopelagic&#8221; zone where elephant seals find their most energy-rich prey, Beltran said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open ocean fishing and climate change could both have dramatic impacts on food resources for elephant seals,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Elephant seals are incredibly successful now, but that could change as their environment shifts in the coming years.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Beltran and Hernandez, the coauthors of the study include Richard Condit, Patrick Robinson, Chandra Goetsch, Marm Kilpatrick, and Daniel Costa at UC Santa Cruz, and Daniel Crocker at Sonoma State University.

(photo by&#160;Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>In a dense forested area, a drone scans the landscape below, helping firefighters spot the best place to fight a raging fire. But in the rural forested territory, the drone struggles to keep track of GPS as it flies through the natural environment, potentially losing its way.&#160;<br/><br/>Ricardo Sanfelice, professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and his team of graduate students and researchers are designing a new Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) system that will address this challenge, with novel methods to safely track and direct aerial vehicles in environments where GPS is weak.&#160;<br/><br/>A grant from the Air Force Research Laboratory will provide about $100,000 in funding for the team to develop their resilient system that will improve tracking and navigation of aerial vehicles for search-and-rescue, emergency services, and more. This will provide huge benefits in rural environments and dense urban landscapes, where GPS is often ineffective because signals are blocked by obstacles such as dense trees or tall buildings.<br/><br/>The new system will provide information about where vehicles are by taking advantage of signals of opportunity &#8211; signals that come from already established infrastructure such as buildings, cell towers, or ground vehicles, but primarily from low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites as the project is launched.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;One of the things we are trying to do is find a way to fuse all sorts of signals of opportunity sources to create a better positioning structure,&#8221; Sanfelice said. &#8220;Signals of opportunity can be public or private services, AM/FM, Digital TV, 5G, aircrafts, satellites &#8211; they can come from a myriad of different assets.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers involved, including Research Associates in the UCSC Cyber-Physical Systems Research Center (CPSRC) Marc Weiss and Charles Barry, also intend for their new system to be used even in areas where GPS is present, because GPS can be intercepted and modified &#8211; a type of falsification called spoofing.&#160;<br/><br/>In contrast, the new PNT system will be much more resilient to information security attacks, as it would be much harder to intercept the low earth satellites used for signals. In the future, when the signals of opportunity expand to more infrastructure, the evolving security needs will be a point of further development. Sanfelice notes that, in the future, systems such as these will require the establishment of protocols or accreditation to ensure that they are used responsibly.&#160;<br/><br/>Through a meticulous mathematical analysis of timing and delay, the engineers can extract the relative distances between the objects providing the signal of opportunity and the object being navigated or tracked. With four or more signals of opportunity, the researchers are able to triangulate the object being tracked. The researchers aim to make their system accurate down to below a meter &#8211; more accurate than most smartphones.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Using signals of opportunity is a novel concept for PNT systems and is a growing area of interest in the cyber-physical systems research community. Including new sources and LEO satellites into these networks will greatly improve accuracy.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The research team will be primarily focused on creating mathematical models for the PNT system, simulating the system, and designing and deploying an algorithm on a programmable radio where signals will be received. They will build these systems using off-the-shelf components, rather than building specialized receivers and computers.<br/><br/>The team will test their system on an electric car, which is currently being developed, that will traverse the main UCSC campus. UCSC&#8217;s wooded terrain will provide an ideal setting to assess the system, as it will have to navigate through the obstruction from a mix of campus buildings interspersed in thick wooded areas with weak GPS.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very good setup to test the accuracy of our positioning system,&#8221; Sanfelice said. &#8220;We definitely want to test it here on campus, because it will be a great benchmark &#8211; it&#8217;s fantastic that this project is well connected to the local geography.&#8221;<br/><br/>Weiss has a lifetime of experience in GPS, having worked in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Time and Frequency Division for thirty years, supporting the development of GPS and specializing in analysis and predictions of clocks and PNT systems. Barry has exploited signals of opportunity to provide PNT in large cities where GPS can be blocked by tall buildings (and inside these buildings where GPS cannot reach).<br/><br/>Graduate student Aaron Monajjemi is implementing an advanced 3-D positioning algorithm in Python and comparing its reliability and accuracy compared to GPS.

(Image credit: Gautham Narayan/Young Supernova Experiment Team)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>UC Santa Cruz astronomers organized the survey, which has discovered thousands of cosmic explosions and other transient events of interest to astronomers and astrophysicists</article-subhead><article-text><p>The <a href="https://yse.ucsc.edu/">Young Supernova Experiment (YSE)</a> began surveying the night sky in 2019, using the Pan-STARSS1 telescope in Hawaii to detect cosmic explosions and other transient astrophysical events shortly after they occur. Now, the first YSE data release is available to the entire astronomy research community.</p>
<p>&#8220;This survey is a discovery portal,&#8221; said Ryan Foley, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, who led the organization of the YSE survey project. &#8220;We are finding thousands of interesting objects, which we can then follow and study with additional observations to understand what we&#8217;re seeing.&#8221;</p>
<p>While most objects in the night sky remain the same night after night, transient or &#8220;time-domain&#8221; astrophysics focuses on dynamic sources that change on human time scales. These transient sources are typically highly energetic astrophysical events&#8212;such as supernovae, tidal disruption events, and kilonovae&#8212;which evolve quickly, rising to a maximum brightness and then fading away over days to months.</p>
<p>The Young Supernova Experiment surveys an area of the sky equivalent to 6,000 times the full moon (4% of the night sky) every three days and has discovered thousands of new cosmic explosions and other astrophysical transients, dozens of them just days or hours after explosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are effectively making movies of the night sky,&#8221; Foley said. &#8220;The sources we can detect this way are some of the most exciting things in the universe&#8212;the deaths of stars, the formation of black holes, and other extreme high-energy scenarios.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new YSE data release is the largest low-redshift multi-band data release of supernovae ever&#8212;slightly fewer than 2,000 objects&#8212;and is the first to use photometric classification and photometric redshifts extensively. This provides valuable precursor data for astronomers to study in advance of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which is expected to transform time-domain astrophysics by discovering orders of magnitude more transient events per year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a sneak peak of what the Rubin Observatory will give us, so we can use it to train algorithms and prepare for when that massive data stream comes,&#8221; Foley said.</p>
<p>Taken with the Pan-STARRS1 telescope at the Haleakal&#257;a Observatory in Hawai&#699;i, the YSE data is transferred to the University of Hawaii&#8217;s Information Technology Center for initial processing and calibration.&#160;Image data was stored, processed, and analyzed on computing systems at UC Santa Cruz, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, and the Dark Cosmology Centre (DARK) at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Gautham Narayan, deputy director of the NCSA&#8217;s Center for AstroPhysical Surveys (CAPS), is leading the cosmological analysis for the data sample, and former CAPS graduate fellow Patrick Aleo is lead author of a paper on the data release, &#8220;The Young Supernova Experiment Data Release 1 (YSE DR1): Light Curves and Photometric Classification of 1975 Supernovae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The data release is an important milestone for supernova science and a testament to the hard work of astronomers scattered across the world at all career stages&#8212;from undergraduate students to professors, pipeline scientists, observers and more,&#8221; Aleo said. &#8220;With further study, it will provide insights into the origin of the supernovae, the properties of their progenitor stars, and the structure of their host galaxies. I am excited to see it used as a reference point for future surveys and the research that the community produces with this dataset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much of the time-domain universe is uncharted,&#8221; Narayan said. &#8220;We still do not know the progenitor systems of many of the most common classes of transients, such as type Ia supernovae, while still using these sources to try and understand the expansion history of our universe. There are many kinds of transients that are theoretically predicted but have never been seen at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Narayan added, &#8220;With high-redshift experiments such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope about to begin operations, we saw an opportunity to establish our Young Supernova Experiment to be a low-redshift anchor. We can probe time scales that these newer experiments cannot and find lots of transients in the nearby universe to compare to their samples in the distant universe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foley&#8217;s team has published several papers based on follow-up observations of transients initially detected by YSE. But he said there is much more work to be done with the data now being released. &#8220;The real power here is in the sample sizes, not just the one-in-a-thousand events,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you have a big sample of one kind of supernova you can really start to understand that population and its diversity, and that&#8217;s something we have not fully taken advantage of yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>YSE is a collaboration between UC Santa Cruz, the DARK Cosmology Centre (University of Copenhagen), the University of Illinois, and other partner institutions. In addition to Foley, other UCSC astronomers involved in the project, all coauthors of the paper, include Professor Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, postdoctoral scholars Mar&#237;a Jos&#233; Bustamante Rosell, Phil Macias, Peter McGill, and Kirsty Taggart, and graduate students David Coulter, Kyle Davis, C&#233;sar Rojas-Bravo, Sierra Dodd, and Ricardo Yarza.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c85abd40807270465f09ecd031831818"><name>incoming-storm</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Incoming Storm Thursday and Friday</title><summary>The National Weather Service is forecasting heavy rains and strong winds in Santa Cruz beginning Thursday and continuing into Saturday.</summary><start-date>1678262400000</start-date><display-name>Incoming Storm Thursday and Friday</display-name><path>/2023/03/incoming-storm</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/incoming-storm</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1678398635308</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1678398824818</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The National Weather Service is </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat%3D36.974240000000066%26lon%3D-122.03097999999994%23.ZAkWeuzMJuV&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678478301561000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3NMdKZmAQ4iB4xKUYwfXZT" href="https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=36.974240000000066&amp;lon=-122.03097999999994#.ZAkWeuzMJuV" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>forecasting heavy rains and strong winds</span></a></span><span> in Santa Cruz beginning Thursday and continuing into Saturday.

Davis participated in a live streamed conversation o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n mass incarceration, the toll it takes on society, and ways the arts and humanities drive opportunities for civic, scholarly, and creative engagement across the criminal-legal system.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named for an initiative launched with a $125 million grant, Imagining Freedom&#8217;s purpose is to make obvious the harm the American carceral state has on society, and people of color and those in poverty disproportionately,</span><a href="https://mellon.org/initiatives/imagining-freedom/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the initiative&#8217;s site explains.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alongside Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and professor Mitchell S. Jackson and artist and curator Jesse Krimes, Dent and Davis spoke on ways &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incarceration denies millions of people full participation in American society&#8221;&#8212;and how in turn, &#8220;American society is denied their artistic, cultural, and intellectual contributions,&#8221; per the event description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderator Dr. Elizabeth Alexander, the Mellon Foundation&#8217;s President, introduced Dent, a renowned scholar and expert in legal studies, feminist studies and History of Consciousness, and Davis, a scholar, philosopher, and global icon for human rights, to explore the &#8220;intellectual and imaginative communities that transcend the experience of incarceration,&#8221; and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posed questions to the panelists surrounding the toll mass incarceration&#8212;over 70 million people in the US&#8212;takes and &#8220;all the ways the criminal justice system impacts us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work being done at UC Santa Cruz punctuated the conversation. Dent expressed excitement that the campus &#8220;has just established a Visualizing Abolition Studies curriculum,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are going to be training students through arts and humanities to think carefully about how we receive data on incarceration, how we&#8217;re inundated by an environment that tells us about incarceration every day in ways we are not interrogating.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dent said she is &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thrilled about this initiative,&#8221; and the &#8220;work of creatives and artists&#8221; that &#8220;will be essential to allow us to move through this next period.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Mellon Foundation supports Visualizing Abolition, a public scholarship initiative at UCSC developed by Dent and Dr. Rachel Nelson, Director of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences. The initiative&#8217;s site explains that the program &#8220;involves art exhibitions, public events, postdoctoral fellowships, a faculty working group, and curriculum development that reaches across prison borders to foster creative research, aiming to shift the social attachment to prisons through art and education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis focused primarily around the need to change &#8220;the ways people think about incarceration by introducing new vocabularies,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Language is always central to our efforts to engage in projects of radical social transformation.&#8221; For example, taking on the term &#8220;prison-industrial complex,&#8221; because &#8220;it would allow us to disarticulate crime and punishment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People don&#8217;t necessarily go to prison because they&#8217;ve committed crimes. &#8230; We as abolitionists argue that those on the inside need to be able to participate in the process of reimagining our entire society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with language, visual work is key to this reimagining, including art by currently incarcerated individuals. &#8220;Without addressing popular culture in which we&#8217;re immersed about the ideology of the prison system,&#8221; Dent said, &#8220;we&#8217;re not going to be able to imagine a new reality. Art needs to be at the center of what we're trying to build and what we are trying to change. We don't have a visual culture without incarceration being represented.&#8221; Discussing jackie summel&#8217;s </span><a href="https://solitarygardens.org/about"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solitary Gardens</span></i> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">project on the panel, Dent said that summel is &#8220;an incredible artist&#8221; creating &#8220;social practice art.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On view until June 2024 at the Baskin Art Studios, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solitary Garden </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at UCSC was created </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in collaboration with Tim Young, an artist on Death Row in San Quentin State Prison. Young has been &#8220;on d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eath row since 2006,&#8221; Dent explained. &#8220;Tim saw himself as an artist even before he was incarcerated. He was concerned with issues of environmentalism, other issues he has thought about through art for many years. Tim and jackie have produced the Solitary Garden that exists now on the UC Santa Cruz Campus. It&#8217;s a beautiful space right in the center of the arts complex where we can walk through and meditate and see Tim&#8217;s letters and see what Tim wanted to have planted and how he imagines the world he would have liked to have lived in and the world he lives in in his mind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis concluded by reminding viewers that &#8220;as we imagine freedom, it&#8217;s important not to assume that freedom is a destination,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Freedom is actually a process, it&#8217;s actually the journey. I&#8217;m smiling now because I can remember when it was not possible to have conversations like this. People most affected by violence of prison systems were afraid to talk about prison. That&#8217;s an indication of how we can be successful in our journey for freedom that will be an infinite journey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the discussion ended, the track &#8220;Tell &#8216;Em the Truth&#8221; from the album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom First</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Keith LaMar and Albert Marqu&#232;s&#8212;the first album in history by an artist on death row&#8212;began to play.</span></p>

<p>Lunge feeding whales accelerate toward a patch of prey, engulf a huge volume of water, and then filter out the prey through the baleen plates in their mouths. This strategy is used by the largest group of baleen whales, known as rorquals, which includes blue, fin, humpback, and minke whales.</p>
<p>The ability to engulf large amounts of prey-laden water is essential to making this feeding strategy pay off, and the energy efficiency increases with larger body size. An 80-ton blue whale, for example, can engulf a water volume equivalent to 135% of its body mass, whereas a 5-ton minke whale can engulf a volume equal to 42% of its body mass.</p>
<p>In the new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-01993-2">published March 13 in <em>Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</em></a>, researchers used noninvasive suction tags to observe 23 Antarctic minke whales in the waters off the West Antarctic Peninsula, tracking their daytime and nighttime foraging behavior as they fed on Antarctic krill. Data from previous studies of krill-feeding humpback whales and blue whales were used for comparison.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we calculate how much energy they use in foraging and what their overall intake should be based on their size, we find that minke whales are right at the threshold,&#8221; said first author David Cade, who led the study as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and is now at Stanford&#8217;s Hopkins Marine Station. &#8220;Anything smaller than a minke could not achieve the foraging rates necessary to survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minke whales are not as well studied as other species of baleen whales, in part because they can be harder to find and tag.</p>
<p>&#8220;The data in this study represent more information on a poorly studied species than has ever been published previously and is helping us to better understand not only the species, but the role of baleen whales in marine ecosystems,&#8221; said coauthor Ari Friedlaender, professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;With so little known about this species that is being impacted by climate change, the more we understand their ecology and behavior the better we can protect them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers observed remarkably high feeding rates for minke whales, especially at night, when they were often lunging every 15 seconds or so. Krill come to the surface at night and stay in the depths during the day, so daytime feeding requires deep dives, which are less efficient for smaller animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the day they feed at depths comparable to humpbacks and blue whales, but their foraging rates aren&#8217;t as high because they&#8217;re smaller,&#8221; Cade said. &#8220;Their nighttime feeding rates are two to five times the day rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>At night, the smaller, more maneuverable minke whales are well suited for pursuing small, scattered patches of krill at the surface. &#8220;When they&#8217;re surface feeding, they don&#8217;t have to hold their breath during dives and they can do lunges over and over again,&#8221; Cade said. &#8220;Only at night can they get the really high feeding rates they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also addresses questions about the evolution of baleen whales and the origins of a feeding strategy that depends on large body size. Lunge feeding is thought to have arisen first in whales about the size of today&#8217;s Antarctic minke whales. This enabled the evolution of whales with gigantic body sizes, such as blue whales, during the past 5 million years when changing ocean conditions led to the formation of predictable regions with large prey patches that could be efficiently exploited by lunge-feeding whales.</p>
<p>&#8220;Minke whales represent one extreme, at the small end of the spectrum, for how filter feeding in ocean predators evolved,&#8221; Friedlaender said. &#8220;Understanding both the maximum and minimum size constraints on baleen whale size really helps us understand how this group of animals has evolved and how they affect and are impacted by marine ecosystems.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seidl won $3,000 for her presentation <em>&#8216;Silence in Paradise: Fighting Extinction and Infectious Disease in Hawaiian Birds.&#8217;</em> She will compete in the UC systemwide Grad Slam to be held May 5 in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Grad Slam is an annual contest that challenges graduate students to explain their research to an audience in three minutes. Participants are judged on how well they engage the audience, how clearly they communicate key concepts, and how effectively they focus and present their ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grad Slam is the signature program of the Graduate Division and is my personal highlight of the academic year,&#8221; said Peter Biehl, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. &#8220;It&#8217;s a chance for our students to show the incredible work they do and why it matters to the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seidl opened her presentation by playing two sound clips, one of a Hawaiian forest filled with birdsong, and another in which no birds could be heard, which she said is the sound of many forests in Hawaii today. Seidl is working with Marm Kilpatrick, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and an expert in infectious diseases, to study avian malaria in Hawaiian birds. The relatively recent introduction of the parasite to Hawaii means Hawaiian birds have little resistance to it, so infected birds tend to have high parasite loads and often die, she said.</p>
<p>In her Ph.D. research, Seidl is studying the transmission of avian malaria to identify where the risk of infections is greatest and where mosquito management efforts could help slow the spread of the disease. She said she wants her research to have &#8220;a tangible impact on managing an infectious disease threatening animals, ecosystems, and cultures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The runner up was Meloddy Gao, a first-year M.F.A. student in the Social Documentation Program. Her presentation titled <em>&#8216;Swimming Lessons: Observing Grief Across Oceans&#8217;</em> won her a $1,500 prize.</p>
<p>Gao said she is excited about working with Asian American communities at the crossroads of social advocacy and art. &#8220;While my film is personal, the themes of intergenerational communication, identity, and grief are experiences many people connect with,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Choice award ($750) went to C&#233;sar Rojas-Bravo, a 6th-year Ph.D. student in astronomy and astrophysics, for his presentation on <em>&#8216;Using Exploding Stars to Decipher Dark Energy, the Universe&#8217;s Biggest Mystery.&#8217;</em> Through his research, he said, he is &#8220;continuing the legacy of thousands of astronomers in history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six other graduate students competed for the top spots at the UCSC Grad Slam finals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so proud of all of our graduate students who competed both in the preliminary divisional rounds and in the final last week,&#8221; Biehl said. &#8220;I will cheer for Christa Seidl at the final in San Francisco in May. I am enormously impressed by both her impactful research on climate change and her passionate presentation of it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="db9571e98072704623dfe456a1a9af29"><name>telus-nsf-career</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Planetary scientist Myriam Telus wins NSF CAREER Award</title><summary>Myriam Telus, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support her research on the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets. </summary><start-date>1678690800000</start-date><display-name>Planetary scientist Myriam Telus wins NSF CAREER Award</display-name><path>/2023/03/telus-nsf-career</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/telus-nsf-career</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1678721249752</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1678721571227</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/03/images/myriam-telus-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/03/images/myriam-telus-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>myriam-telus-300.jpg</name><display-name>myriam-telus-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>85340</file-size><width>300</width><height>340</height></image><image-alt>Myriam Telus</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/03/images/myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/03/images/myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>myriam-telus-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22441</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Myriam Telus</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Myriam Telus</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Myriam Telus, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to support her research on the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets.</p>
<p>In her laboratory, Telus analyzes the gases released from pristine meteorite samples when they are heated in a high-temperature furnace. Meteorites are left over rocky material from the early stages of planet formation, and Telus&#8217;s analyses provide clues to the initial composition of the atmospheres of rocky planets. The early atmospheres of rocky planets are thought to form mostly from gases released as a result of intense heating within the planet&#8217;s interior.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meteorites provide a unique way to link the initial makeup of atmospheres to the ingredients that went into building planets,&#8221; Telus said. &#8220;This connection is important because exoplanets are not easily observed by telescopes; the main window into these other worlds is through their atmospheres.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NSF CAREER Award will support Telus&#8217;s work to perform meteorite outgassing analyses that will be helpful for interpreting exoplanet observations. The results will be relevant for rocky planets, including those around sun-like stars, those that formed in more oxidizing conditions, hot rocky planets, and those that experience open-system conditions. This research can provide foundational data for observing, modeling, and interpreting the atmospheric signatures of exoplanets.</p>
<p>Telus, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2017, also received a NASA Early Career Award in 2020.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e111fb648072704666911a882d0d8a5b"><name>cacsw-brief</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Join the Campus Advisory Committee on the Status of Womxn</title><summary>Our Campus Advisory Committee on the Status of Womxn (CACSW) invites interest and nominations for roles: Co-Chair (Faculty), Co-Chair (Staff), Secretary/Treasurer, and Member(s)-at-Large. </summary><start-date>1678777200000</start-date><path>/2023/03/cacsw-brief</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/cacsw-brief</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1678813297493</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1678813297493</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div dir="ltr">

One of these games is called the wall pursuit game, a relatively simple model for a situation in which a faster pursuer has the goal to catch a slower evader who is confined to moving along a wall.&#160;<br/><br/>Since this game was first described nearly 60 years ago, there has been a dilemma within the game &#8212; a set of positions where it was thought that no game optimal&#160; solution existed. But now, Milutinovic and his colleagues have proved in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9661291/authors#authors">new paper</a> published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control that this long-standing dilemma does not actually exist, and introduced a new method of analysis that proves there is always a deterministic solution&#160; to the wall pursuit game. This discovery opens the door to resolving other similar challenges that exist within the field of differential games, and enables better reasoning about autonomous systems such as driverless vehicles.&#160;<br/><br/>Game theory is used to reason about behavior across a wide range of fields, such as economics, political science, computer science and engineering. Within game theory, the Nash equilibrium is one of the most commonly recognized concepts. The concept was introduced by mathematician John Nash and it defines game optimal strategies for all players in the game to finish the game with the least regret. Any player who chooses not to play their game optimal strategy will end up with more regret, therefore, rational players are all motivated to play their equilibrium strategy.&#160;<br/><br/>This concept applies to the wall pursuit game &#8212; a classical Nash equilibrium strategy pair for the two players, the pursuer and evader, that describes their best strategy in almost all of their positions. However, there are a set of positions between the pursuer and evader for which the classical analysis fails to yield the game optimal strategies and concludes with the existence of the dilemma. This set of positions are known as a singular surface &#8211; and for years, the research community has accepted the dilemma as fact.&#160;<br/><br/>But Milutinovic and his co-authors were unwilling to accept this.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This bothered us because we thought, if the evader knows there is a singular surface, there is a threat that the evader can go to the singular surface and misuse it,&#8221; Milutinovic said. &#8220;The evader can force you to go to the singular surface where you don&#8217;t know how to act optimally &#8212; and then we just don&#8217;t know what the implication of that would be in much more complicated games.&#8221;<br/><br/>So Milutinovic and his coauthors came up with a new way to approach the problem, using a mathematical concept that was not in existence when the wall pursuit game was originally conceived. By using the viscosity solution of the Hamilton&#8211;Jacobi&#8211;Isaacs equation and introducing a rate of loss analysis for solving the singular surface they were able to find that a&#160; game optimal solution can be determined in all circumstances of the game and resolve the dilemma.&#160;<br/><br/>The viscosity solution of partial differential equations is a mathematical concept that was non-existent until the 1980s and offers a unique line of reasoning about the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. It is now well known that the concept is relevant for reasoning about optimal control and game theory problems.<br/><br/>Using viscosity solutions, which are functions, to solve game theory problems involves using calculus to find the derivatives of these functions. It is relatively easy to find game optimal solutions when the viscosity solution associated with a game has well-defined derivatives. This is not the case for the wall-pursuit game, and this lack of well-defined derivatives creates the dilemma.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Typically when a dilemma exists, a practical approach is that players randomly choose one of possible actions and accept losses resulting from these decisions. But here lies the catch: if there is a loss, each rational player will want to minimize it.&#160;<br/><br/>So to find how players might minimize their losses, the authors analyzed the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation around the singular surface where the derivatives are not well-defined. Then, they introduced a rate of loss analysis across these singular surface states of the equation. They found that when each actor minimizes its rate of losses, there are well-defined game strategies for their actions on the singular surface.<br/><br/>The authors found that not only does this rate of loss minimization define the game optimal actions for the singular surface, but it is also in agreement with the game optimal actions in every possible state where the classical analysis is also able to find these actions.<br/><br/>&#8220;When we take the rate of loss analysis and apply it elsewhere, the game optimal actions from the classical analysis are not impacted ,&#8221; Milutinovic said. &#8220;We take the classical theory and we augment it with the rate of loss analysis, so a solution exists everywhere. This is an important result showing that the augmentation is not just a fix to find a solution on the singular surface, but a fundamental contribution to game theory.<br/><br/>Milutinovic and his coauthors are interested in exploring other game theory problems with singular surfaces where their new method could be applied. The paper is also an open call to the research community to similarly examine other dilemmas.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Now the question is, what kind of other dilemmas can we solve?&#8221; Milutinovic said.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e1537d4c8072704666911a889b351ee3"><name>stem-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Local educators shared expertise at the first STEM Education Central Coast Conference</title><summary>The conference, which was organized by California State University Monterey Bay in collaboration with UC Santa Cruz, was designed by and for local educators in science, technology, engineering and math.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference, which was organized by California State University Monterey Bay in collaboration with UC Santa Cruz, was designed by and for local educators in science, technology, engineering and math. The goal was to share expertise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almond was inspired by hearing ways to help English language learners grasp STEM concepts, and learning that the salary range for experienced teachers can go up to $100,000.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It eased my nerves about it,&#8221; Almond said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s just the kind of feedback conference co-organizer Soleste Hilberg wants to hear. The UC Santa Cruz teaching education director said she supported the conference in part to address the shortage of K-12 teachers in science and math.&#160; It&#8217;s particularly hard to retain teachers in the central coast because of the high cost of living, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hilberg said her role with the conference is part of her ongoing efforts to create opportunities for STEM undergraduates to see how wonderful it is to teach math and science.&#160; She also focused on local youth, especially those who are Hispanic and are of color,&#160; because there is a better chance that they might stay in the area and become STEM teachers rather than moving on.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference attracted 183 people, including local math and science teachers, students preparing to be teachers in credential programs and undergraduates from UC Santa Cruz, California State University, Monterey Bay and Hartnell and Cabrillo community colleges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It featured booths that offered resources for teachers, including UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Life Lab, which helps educators incorporate school gardens.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson Van, a UC Santa Cruz graduate who is now teaching physics at Santa Cruz High School, said he enjoyed getting together with so many of his peers. Among the highlights of the conference for him was listening to the keynote talk from George Matsumoto, a senior education and research specialist at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and learning about the many ways local teachers can get involved with the community. That included &#8220;citizen science,&#8221; the public helping with scientific research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Van said he appreciated the tips on how to motivate apathetic students, such as incorporating card games. He is constantly confronted with students who say physics is hard and wonder why they should have to learn it. &#8220;Young teachers in general are grabbing at ideas wherever they can get it from,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The struggle for youth these days is to keep them motivated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Van was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a graduate student in the masters/credential program for education at UC Santa Cruz and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a student in the university&#8217;s Cal Teach program, which places science, math and engineering majors in K-12 classrooms. Gretchen Andreasen, who directs Cal Teach and co-coordinated the conference, said she loved the way the conference participants were invested in the event. &#8220;To me, one of the things that was heartwarming was how many people said &#8216;I&#8217;ll see you next year,&#8217;&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e16dfa098072704666911a88be0eb4c2"><name>climate-policy-feedback</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Strengthening UC Climate Policy: Community Feedback Forum</title><summary>As the climate crisis worsens, UC is evolving its response with an updated climate policy that shifts away from a carbon neutrality strategy that requires significant reliance on offsets towards a strategy of direct decarbonization. </summary><start-date>1678777200000</start-date><path>/2023/03/climate-policy-feedback</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/climate-policy-feedback</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1678819326456</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1678819326456</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the climate crisis worsens, UC is evolving its response with an updated climate policy that shifts away from a carbon neutrality strategy that requires significant reliance on offsets towards a strategy of direct decarbonization.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xavier Livermon, associate professor of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, was hired two years ago to build and start the minor. He has become the program&#8217;s guiding visionary as well as its first designated faculty member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last July, two new hires started at UC Santa Cruz &#8212; fahima ife, associate professor of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies (CRES), and Sophia Azeb, assistant professor of CRES, who are both designated faculty members for the Black Studies program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livermon said the program&#8217;s recent growth reflects a strong demand for &#8220;spaces of potential reckoning in the nation&#8221; in reaction to acts of injustice including police killings of unarmed Black people.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One particular flashpoint was the murder of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Floyd&#8217;s death caused international outrage.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of those spaces of reckoning was of course in the academy,&#8221; Livermon said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are craving these courses at a time when there is a lot of interest in bringing Black Studies to more institutions, and in light of that, we&#8217;ve made great progress here.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Studies minor is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered through UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Critical Race and Ethnic Studies department, which is located within the Humanities Division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Studies minor has an interdisciplinary approach, drawing from areas of study including sociology, the arts, anthropology, geography, the social sciences and education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Livermon hopes that the minor will attract more Black students, more students of color, and more students who are interested in questions of social justice and how to remedy anti-Black racism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he thought the minor could be augmented into a major, he said: &#8220;You need to crawl before you walk, right? And so we&#8217;re starting with a minor. If the minor gets to the point where it seems like it&#8217;s really over-enrolled, and there is a lot of interest, at both the student and administrative level, we can go back to the drawing table and think about the next steps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re catching up from a place where there were</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no hires to a time when we now have multiple people, some of them designated specifically for the Black Studies program, and some of them from other areas of UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Livermon continued.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point there are 17 students enrolled in the Black Studies minor, which launched in the fall of 2020 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in response to overwhelming demand from undergraduates across academic divisions.</span></p>
<p><strong>A collaborative process&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Critical Race And Ethnic Studies department worked closely with the Black Student Union (BSU) to build the minor. &#160;BSU offered input on the proposal for the minor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, members of the department and the student organization worked to expand the ranks of Black Studies faculty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Mitchell, an associate professor of CRES and Feminist Studies, and Christine Hong, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an associate professor of Literature and the current chair of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, worked with BSU to develop the proposal for the minor. Hong also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted a BSU independent study adjacent to the first Black Studies faculty search.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong worked with Livermon, CRES Designated Emphasis and Education candidate Andrea del Carmen Vazquez, and former CRES-BSU intern Ileana Waddy, to develop the course &#8220;Black Radical University?&#8221; (BRU), a collaboration between CRES and BSU that will be offered for the second time this spring quarter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In its collaboration with CRES, BSU has helped to expand the department curriculum in powerful, visionary ways that center the transformative organizing of Black students locally on this campus, more broadly nationwide, and on an international scale,&#8221; Hong said. &#8220;BRU is a testament to an inspiring legacy of Black radical student organizing that stretches back to the earliest days of this campus.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CRES-BSU intern&#8217;s position has been funded by the office of Dean of Students Garrett Naiman.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Sheyna Burns: &#8220;Black Studies illuminates the lies we&#8217;ve been taught&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>"Knowing history is instrumental in planning my future," said Sheyna Burns (Oakes, Sociology and Agroecology, &#8216;25), who plans to attend law school after graduation. "Black Studies courses are vital. We must control our narrative because, when we don't, look how we are portrayed."<br/><br/>"Black Studies illuminates the lies we have been taught in our education," Burns continued. "Even today, it's amusing to witness the attempts to indoctrinate others by emphasizing the advancements of one group of people while ignoring the rich past and present of others, as if African people were not the first at everything and did not teach and give birth to the rest of the world."<br/><br/>Black Studies helps to fill in the missing pieces in her previous education.<br/><br/>"Growing up, school wasn't very interesting because it felt as though I was being force-fed European culture and history," Burns said. "I have always been curious about my culture, but it was never taught in depth. Of course, we learned about MLK, Rosa Parks, and Harriet Tubman. But they never spoke of Marcus Garvey, Huey P. Newton, the Mali empire, or Mansa Musa (the 14th-century ruler of the Kingdom of Mali)."</p>
<p><strong>Ethan Davis: centering Blackness while working in the sciences</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the BSU leadership core, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethan Davis (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stevenson &#8216;23 Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, &#8216;23), took part in the search process that led to the first Black Studies hire in CRES, Xavier Livermon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Studies classes make him feel more empowered and less of an outsider, while motivating him to study the many Black contributions to STEM fields.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis serves as Stevenson College resident advisor, Black Student Union treasurer, chair of the Student Union Governing Body, and Black Student Union representative for the John R. Lewis College Advisory Council.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he made his way through UC Santa Cruz, Davis longed for a concentration that centered the Black experience and provided him with a critical framework for his scientific studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis&#8217;s ancestry is Jamaican, Grenadian, and Cuban. &#8220;I am a first-generation American, with my mom hailing from London and my Dad hailing from Jamaica,&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;But when I was growing up in Riverside, any knowledge of Black history was through nuggets of knowledge from family, Black teachers, allies, and my own self-discovery and teaching.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Black Studies program allows for Black students who did not major in areas such as Critical Race and Ethnic Studies and sociology to have direct organized access to college courses that focus on their identity and enrich our existence,&#8221; Davis said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His interest in Black Studies has impacted his leadership and advocacy on campus. Davis is a peer mentor in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Learning Support Services center. As part of his work there, he created and shared a document detailing Black, indigenous, POC and LGBTQ+ contributions to chemistry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>fahima ife: creative practice, ecopoetics, and Black Studies</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xavier Livermon praised new faculty hire fahima ife for helping students think about how creative work can engage social and political issues in Black Studies. &#8220;Professor ife has such a deep understanding not just of literature and literary formations but visual culture and the making of art,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her classes for Creative/Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, fahima ife teaches undergraduate and graduate students creative practice and process and self-discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also engenders these values in her work and advocacy. ife is a poet, editor, DJ, and cultural anthropologist with a deep understanding of Black feminist performance and ecopoetics. She is also the author of the acclaimed book of essays and poetry </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maroon Choreography </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Duke University Press, 2021), which poet Fred Moten hailed as &#8220;funky, rigorous and lyrical &#8212; an incredible tempest of a book.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In ife&#8217;s classes, in addition to class readings and other work, she asks students to write, or record themselves speaking, in stream-of-consciousness for 10 to 15 continuous minutes each day of the quarter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At different points in the quarter, I ask them to return to these streams, to listen, to lean into them, and to take note of patterns that seem to recur as a sort of jumping-off point into making something creative,&#8221; ife said. &#8220;From there, we are slowly building playlists, and &#8216;dreamweaving&#8217; in all sorts of ways.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ife&#8217;s classes create the conditions for joy, community, and friendship. &#8220;Classrooms and campuses remain such politically contested spaces, incredibly hostile spaces, and yet they also have the capacity to inspire hope,&#8221; ife said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In part because of her early formative experiences, ife developed teaching methods grounded in self-love, self-care, and friendship &#8220;mostly because I was still learning all of that too. I experience great pleasure learning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my students.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the classroom, I invite students to share their work-in-progress with each other, to listen to each other, to create room for each other, to celebrate each other&#8217;s accomplishments, and to practice making things together in real time,&#8221; ife said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ife has big dreams for Black Studies at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;As a public facing poet and intellectual, I really want to study with our most celebrated living musicians practicing the Black arts,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wants to invite performers, artists, and poets to engage in far-ranging discussions with Black Studies and CRES students and take part in a series of creative/critical gatherings and performances, helping to turn UC Santa Cruz into a hub of transnational Black intellectual and creative life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Sophia Azeb: Black diasporas, Black internationalism, and Third World solidarity</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophia Azeb&#8217;s research focuses on how blackness is lived, defined and contested in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trans-Atlantic, trans-Mediterranean, trans-Saharan, and Nile valley cultures and politics. She plans to teach a class on comparative diasporas next year, drawing from scholarly, literary, sound and visual materials.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livermon called attention to Azeb&#8217;s strong focus on Black internationalism, delving into the dialogues between Black activists and those who live in other parts of the world including North Africa.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her teaching and scholarship reminds our students that many of the social issues in Black Studies have global and international dimensions,&#8221; Livermon said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azeb traces the roots of Black Studies to &#8220;the robust traditions of student-led struggle and innovation.&#8221; She also emphasized the importance of a global outlook in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Black Studies program: &#8220;Black Studies is a field that, in the words of (Black historian, journalist and activist) C.L.R. James means to &#8220;reorganize the intellectual life and historical outlook of the United States and of world civilization as a whole.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her teaching, Azeb emphasizes on innovation, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Azeb works with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">students to develop their writing practice, she also has them submit films, short stories, 3D zines, intricately crafted cosmograms, abolitionist manifestos, and even tarot decks devoted to critical university studies as final projects that accompany their written compositions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am always deeply honored to be trusted with these experiments in form, and I am eager to continue learning from my students at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Azeb said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Expanding at a crossroads</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Studies at UC Santa Cruz has been expanding at a time when two related but very different upwellings have been taking place in the U.S. &#8212; on the one hand, a powerful surge of Black activism in the wake of police killings that have drawn international outcry, and, on the other hand, a backlash from far-right conservatives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Black Studies makes inroads in U.S. colleges, hundreds of K&#8211;12 schools have been the subject of pressure campaigns targeting any field of study that can be construed as promoting &#8220;critical race theory&#8221;&#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which focuses on the ways in which racism is reproduced through social institutions like law and education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the state of Florida recently announced it would not let its high schools offer a new Advanced Placement course on African American Studies, going so far as to call the course &#8220;historically inaccurate.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the nonprofit that determines curriculum for the AP courses unveiled a version of the African American Studies course that cut out works from the late bell hooks, the celebrated feminist, theorist, and cultural critic who graduated from UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this fraught environment, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Studies minor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">immerses students in the intellectual histories, political movements, cultural expressions, and critical theories of the Black diaspora</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a strong multidisciplinary focus and attention to social justice.&#160;</span></p>

The campus will solicit bids for the first phase of the project later this year, with the goal of starting construction in early 2024.<br/><br/>Student Housing West includes bed space for more than 3,000 students. The project, spread over two campus sites, also allows UC Santa Cruz to expand childcare services.<br/><br/>Student Housing West provides the most rapid and direct route to creating more housing for undergraduate and graduate students. Stable, affordable housing is a foundation for student success, one of the campus&#8217;s highest priorities.<br/><br/>&#8220;A UC Santa Cruz education is transformational, and studies have shown, time and time again, that for students to be successful, they need their basic needs met. Student Housing West will go a long way in helping us meet the housing needs of our students,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;I&#8217;m thankful that we are finally moving forward with this project.&#8221;<br/><br/>A number of local elected officials offered their support for the project. Santa Cruz Mayor Fred Keeley traveled to the Board of Regents meeting in San Francisco, telling the UC leaders of his support for the university and Student Housing West, and that the Santa Cruz City Council voted unanimously to back the project. County Supervisor Zach Friend also urged approval, noting in a letter to the board the tremendous local need for more student housing, and the connection between housing and student success.<br/><br/>In the first phase of the Student Housing West project, UC Santa Cruz will build 140 new two-bedroom apartments for students with families, a community room, and a childcare center. The new early childhood education center will serve up to 140 children of faculty and staff as well as students, roughly double the capacity of our current facility. The new Family Student Housing community will be adjacent to the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge drives, across the street from existing employee housing, close to a local elementary school, and near the main campus entrance. The new housing community is anticipated to open for students with families in fall 2025.<br/><br/>After the new Family Student Housing community is built, UC Santa Cruz will remove the aging buildings currently home to students with families so that the campus can build six new buildings that will provide housing for approximately 2,700 undergraduate students and 220 graduate students. The campus anticipates that the second phase could be completed in fall 2028. <br/><br/>There are currently limited on-campus housing options for upper-division undergraduates and graduate students. Many of these students must find housing in the surrounding community, which remains in a severe housing crisis like much of the state. <br/><br/>All of these new on-campus beds are in addition to the roughly 600 that campus is adding through its ongoing renovation and expansion of Kresge College. <br/><br/>In addition to providing significantly more housing, Student Housing West will advance the campus&#8217;s long-standing commitment to sustainability. The project includes solar panels and other energy-efficiency design features as well as a water-recycling facility that will allow UC Santa Cruz to reuse wastewater for non-potable uses, such as flushing toilets and irrigation.<br/><br/>Regents certified the project Environmental Impact Report and approved the business terms and design in March 2019. Since then, the project has been mired in the courts, with lawsuits challenging regental approval and EIR certification. Santa Cruz County Superior Court has twice upheld the adequacy of the EIR, as did the Sixth District Court of Appeal. Regents re-approved the project in March 2021. A final appeal filed by a project opponent is pending. <br/><br/>&#8220;Moving forward on Student Housing West is a milestone for our campus, and I&#8217;m thrilled for the students who will ultimately benefit, but university leadership understands that one project does not solve our housing woes,&#8221; said Chancellor Larive. &#8220;We will continue to steadfastly pursue additional housing opportunities for our students, faculty and staff.&#8221;</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>What is happening with Student Housing West?</strong><br/>To move forward with plans to build housing for more than 3,000 students, UC Santa Cruz secured finance and project approvals from the UC Board of Regents. This means that the campus will be able to solicit bids to build a new housing complex for students with families at the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge drives. This first phase of the project will include 140 two-bedroom apartments, a community room, and a new early childhood education center. <br/><br/><strong>When will construction begin for the first phase?</strong><br/>UC Santa Cruz will solicit construction bids later this year with the goal of starting construction in early 2024. The Family Student Housing community is anticipated to open in fall 2025. <br/><br/><strong>When will construction begin on the second phase?</strong><br/>Once the new Family Student Housing community opens, UC Santa Cruz will be able to tear down aging buildings and construct new housing for upper division undergraduate and graduate students along Heller Drive, on the west side of campus. This phase of the project will include six new buildings that will provide housing for approximately 2,700 undergraduate students and 220 graduate students. The campus anticipates that this construction will be completed by fall 2028. <br/><br/><strong>Why has the project been delayed?</strong><br/>Student Housing West was first approved in early 2019, though lawsuits prevented the campus from meeting its original timeline to build more housing. <br/><br/><strong>What changed with the financing?</strong><br/>UC Santa Cruz secured approval from the UC Board of Regents to implement Student Housing West as a campus-managed capital project. The project was initially proposed and approved as a public-private partnership. Switching to UC financing will be cheaper than private financing, and enables UC Santa Cruz to move forward in the most cost-effective and expeditious manner without further delay from ongoing litigation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f03a28d68072704659d0249fda684cad"><name>shw-approved</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Regent action advances Student Housing West</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz, following finance and project approvals earlier today by the UC Board of Regents, is now able to move ahead with construction of our long-planned 3,000-bed Student Housing West project.</summary><start-date>1678950000000</start-date><display-name>Regent action advances Student Housing West</display-name><path>/2023/03/shw-approved</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/shw-approved</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1679067588807</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1679067588807</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>I am thrilled to share the news that UC Santa Cruz, </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/03/student-housing-child-care-services.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1679152386684000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3D7rMxjIhA_Bw8UlPSa9Pf" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/03/student-housing-child-care-services.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>following finance and project approvals earlier today</span></a></span><span> by the UC Board of Regents, is now able to move ahead with construction of our long-planned 3,000-bed Student Housing West project.</span></p>
<p><span>Moving forward on Student Housing West is a milestone for our campus &#8212; the project was first approved by Regents in 2019 &#8212; and I&#8217;m thrilled for our students and our campus community. The project will provide housing at two campus locations and includes a new, university-run childcare facility that will allow us to offer childcare services to all in our campus community.</span></p>
<p><span>The project has two discrete components. Phase one will include 140 new two-bedroom apartments for students with families and a childcare center that will serve up to 140 children of faculty, staff and students, roughly double the capacity of our current facility. This development will be adjacent to the intersection of Hagar and Coolidge drives. It is across the street from existing employee housing, close to a local elementary school, and near the main entrance to campus. Construction is slated to start in early 2024, with families moving into the units as early as fall 2025.</span></p>
<p><span>At that point, construction crews will demolish our current family student housing and existing childcare center to make way for the second phase. In their place we will construct six buildings that will provide housing for approximately 2,700 undergraduate students and 220 graduate students. This second phase could be completed as soon as fall 2028.</span></p>
<p><span>A UC Santa Cruz education is transformational, and studies have shown, time and time again, that for students to be successful, they need their basic needs met. Stable, affordable housing is one of those foundational needs, and Student Housing West will go a long way in helping us meet the housing needs of our students.</span></p>
<p><span>I am grateful for the support from the Regents, the Office of the President, the many Santa Cruz County public officials and housing advocates who spoke out in support of Student Housing West, and to the many people across our campus community who have worked tirelessly to advance this project. That work has paid off.</span></p>
<p><span>I am excited that Student Housing West has earned finance and project approvals, but one project &#8212; even a large one such as this &#8212; does not meet all of our housing needs. Our highest priority remains increasing the amount of campus housing for students, staff, and faculty. Our strategy is focused on developing a pipeline of projects &#8212; both new construction and renovations &#8212; as well as new creative partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span>The first phase of the Kresge College redevelopment is coming to an end, and students this fall will move into new residential halls with 400 beds, complete with student lounges and a new Owl&#8217;s Nest Cafe. The second phase will begin this summer and add another 590 beds that will come online in the 2025-26 academic year. All told, the project will give us roughly 600 more beds than what the college originally held. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span>This is an important moment for our campus. When we make progress on housing, it allows our students to focus more fully on their education, and our faculty and staff on teaching and conducting the transformative research and scholarship that serve society and have come to define UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>

<p>Gaensler is currently director of the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, where he is a professor in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and a Canada Research Chair in Radio Astronomy.</p>
<p>Known for his research on cosmic magnetism, interstellar gas, and cosmic explosions, Gaensler has served as the Canadian Science Director for the Square Kilometre Array, an international radio telescope project, and as the co-chair of the Canadian Astronomy Long Range Plan 2020-2030. He is also co-chair of the Toronto Initiative for Diversity and Excellence (TIDE).</p>
<p>&#8220;Bryan Gaensler is an outstanding leader and researcher,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;He has a proven record of collaborative and visionary leadership that elevates the contributions of others, and his many years of experience inside and outside the classroom inspiring students as an instructor and mentor, along with his commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the sciences, will benefit the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and our entire campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gaensler received his Ph.D. from the University of Sydney in 1999, and subsequently held positions at MIT, the Smithsonian Institution, Harvard University, and the University of Sydney, before joining the University of Toronto in 2015. He has published more than 430 research papers and is the author of a best-selling popular astronomy book, <em>Extreme Cosmos</em>, which has been translated into five languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is an extraordinary place with enormous further potential,&#8221; Gaensler said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to get started in this role, and to partner with so many talented people who share my values and goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, Gaensler gave the 2001 Australia Day Address to the nation and was named Young Australian of the Year in 1999. His research has twice been named as one of <em>Science</em> magazine&#8217;s &#8220;Breakthroughs of the Year&#8221; (in 2005 and 2020), and he has been awarded the American Astronomical Society&#8217;s Pierce Price, the Pawsey Medal of the Australian Academy of Science, and the Martin Award of the Canadian Astronomical Society.</p>
<p>Gaensler will succeed Paul Koch, who has served as dean since 2011. Kletzer thanked Koch for his exemplary leadership of the division over the past 12 years, saying, &#8220;Paul&#8217;s leadership, commitment and vision are the foundation for the many strengths of the Physical and Biological Sciences Division. His commitment to academic student success, to recruiting and hiring a diverse and high-achieving faculty, to growing extramural funding, and to building innovative research and teaching programs are all in evidence now.&#8221; After a sabbatical leave, Koch will return to his teaching and research in Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="003fd031807270466b08f6624ab4248e"><name>dean-pbsci</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Announcing appointment of Dean of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences</title><summary>We are excited to announce the appointment of Bryan Gaensler as UC Santa Cruz’s next Dean of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences.

<p>Me emociona <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/03/gaensler-pbsci-dean.html">anunciar la designaci&#243;n de Bryan Gaensler</a> como el pr&#243;ximo Decano de Ciencias F&#237;sicas y Biol&#243;gicas de la UC Santa Cruz. Su primer d&#237;a en la UCSC est&#225; previsto para el 15 de agosto.</p>
<p>Bryan Gaensler es Director del Instituto Dunlap de Astronom&#237;a y Astrof&#237;sica, Profesor del Departamento David A. Dunlap de Astronom&#237;a y Astrof&#237;sica y Presidente de Investigaciones en Astronom&#237;a Radial de la Universidad de Toronto. Recibi&#243; su PhD en la Universidad de Sydney en 1999, y subsecuentemente desempe&#241;&#243; cargos en MIT, la Instituci&#243;n Smithsonian, la Universidad de Harvard, y la Universidad de Sydney antes de vincularse con la Universidad de Toronto en el 2015. Ha servido como Director del Ciencias Canadienses en el Square Kilometre Array y es copresidente del la Iniciativa por Diversidad y Excelencia de Toronto.</p>
<p>El Dr. Gaensler es un l&#237;der e investigador destacado. Tiene una trayectoria probada en liderazgo colaborativo y visionario que eleva las contribuciones de otros, y sus muchos a&#241;os de experiencia dentro y fuera de las aulas inspiran a los estudiantes como instructor y mentor, conjuntamente con su dedicaci&#243;n al avance de la diversidad, la equidad y la inclusi&#243;n en las ciencias, beneficiar&#225;n a la Divisi&#243;n de Ciencias F&#237;sicas y Biol&#243;gicas y a todo nuestro campus.</p>
<p>Brindo mi profunda gratitud al Decano Paul Koch, quien ha fungido como decano desde el 2011. En los &#250;ltimos 12 a&#241;os ha proporcionado un liderazgo ejemplar a la divisi&#243;n y al campus. El liderazgo, dedicaci&#243;n y visi&#243;n de Paul, son los cimientos de los muchos puntos fuertes de la Divisi&#243;n de Ciencias F&#237;sicas y Biol&#243;gicas. En la actualidad su compromiso con el &#233;xito acad&#233;mico estudiantil, el reclutamiento y la contrataci&#243;n de una facultad diversa y logros de altura, con el creciente financiamiento de extramuros, y al desarrollo de programas de investigaci&#243;n y ense&#241;anza innovadores est&#225;n todos en evidencia. He disfrutado enormemente de colaborar con &#233;l y le estoy muy agradecida por sus muchas contribuciones al campus.</p>
<p>Tambi&#233;n quisiera darles las gracias a los miembros del comit&#233; asesor de b&#250;squedas, sobre todo a los copresidentes John MacMillan y Katharyne Mitchell, porsu labor en revisar y entrevistar a los candidatos. Hemos tenido un s&#243;lido grupo de finalistas. Gracias a Uds., a los muchos de nuestra comunidad del campus que se involucraron con nosotros en el proceso de b&#250;squeda y proporcionaron valiosas respuestas. El aporte ha sido extremadamente &#250;til.</p>
<p>Por favor, acomp&#225;&#241;enme en darle la bienvenida al Dr. Gaensler.</p>
<p>Atentamente,</p>
<p>Lori</p>

<p><span>The recent severe weather we&#8217;ve experienced, both this month and at the start of the year, has had a devastating impact on our community and the surrounding areas. Sadly, torrential rains, high winds, and flooding have damaged many vehicles, homes and businesses, and displaced too many in our community, including students, staff and faculty. My thoughts are with all who have been adversely affected by these powerful storms. </span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>While many are hurting and in need of our support right now, the people of Pajaro especially need our help and attention. The tight-knit Monterey County community sits just south of Watsonville, abutting the Pajaro River. Nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from their homes due to a levee break last week that has caused widespread flooding. Many of those displaced left their homes on short notice, are now staying at nearby evacuation centers and are in urgent need of clothing, hygiene products, food provisions, and more. It is unclear when it will be safe for them to return to their homes.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span>We are committed to helping students, staff, and faculty impacted by this flooding. The university has reached out to students from the Pajaro area offering support and campus resources. I encourage all Banana Slugs to support our neighbors in Pajaro &#8211; and all storm-impacted communities &#8211; through an outpouring of resources, generosity, and care. If you wish to get involved and give back to our community, there are a number of opportunities to do so. Several community organizations are leading efforts to collect donations, assemble volunteers, and raise funding for those impacted by the storms. Here are a few:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Volunteer Opportunities</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Second Harvest Food Bank is looking for additional people to help with food sorting.

<p><span><strong>Donation Needs and Collection Sites</strong></span></p>
<p><span><u>Urgent Needs:</u> Diapers, baby wipes, feminine pads, bath towels, warm blankets, new socks and underwear, bottled water, gently used clothing in good condition, and art and craft supplies for children. Food donations should be pre-packaged and non-perishable.</span>&#160;</p>

<p><span>This is a challenging, uncertain time for many in our community &#8211; and has been since the first series of severe storms hit our Central Coast in January. I&#8217;m immensely grateful for the many ways our university family has come together to lead us through the storms and navigate their aftermath. Let us unite once more in support of one another and to uplift those most in need. </span></p>

<p><span>Las recientes tempestades severas que hemos pasado, tanto este mes como a principios de a&#241;o, han tenido un impacto devastador en nuestra comunidad y las &#225;reas circundantes. Lamentablemente, las lluvias torrenciales, ventoleras e inundaciones han da&#241;ado a muchos veh&#237;culos, hogares y negocios, y desplazado a muchos de nuestra comunidad, inclusive estudiantes, personal y facultad. Mis pensamientos est&#225;n con Uds. y con todos los que se han visto afectados adversamente por estas potentes tormentas.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span>Si bien hay muchos que est&#225;n lastimados y en necesidad de nuestro apoyo en estos momentos, la gente de P&#225;jaro necesita sobre todo nuestra ayuda y atenci&#243;n. La muy unida comunidad del Condado de Monterey se halla justo al sur de Watsonville, colindante con el R&#237;o P&#225;jaro. Casi 2,000 personas han sido evacuadas de sus hogares debido a la rotura de un dique la semana pasada que ha causado inundaciones generalizadas. Muchos de los desplazados que dejaron sus hogares con premura ahora se encuentran en centros de evacuaci&#243;n cercanos y necesitan ropa, art&#237;culos de higiene, provisiones de alimentos y m&#225;s. Se desconoce cu&#225;ndo podr&#225;n regresar con seguridad a sus hogares.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span>Tenemos el compromiso de ayudar al estudiantado, el personal y la facultad impactados por estas inundaciones. La universidad se ha dirigido a los estudiantes del &#225;rea de P&#225;jaro brind&#225;ndoles apoyo y recursos del campus. Insto a todos los Banana Slugs a darles su apoyo a nuestros vecinos de P&#225;jaro &#8211; y a todas las comunidades azotadas por la tormenta &#8211; proporcion&#225;ndoles recursos, generosidad y atenci&#243;n. Si Uds. desean involucrarse y devolver algo a nuestra comunidad, hay numerosas oportunidades para hacerlo. Varias organizaciones comunitarias est&#225;n encabezando labores de recabar donativos, organizar voluntarios, y recaudar fondos para los afectados por las tempestades.

<p><span>Esto es un reto, un momento de incertidumbre para muchos de nuestra comunidad &#8211; y as&#237; lo ha sido desde la primera serie de tormentas severas que azotaron nuestra Costa Central en enero. Estoy inmensamente agradecida por las muchas formas en que nuestra familia de la universidad se ha unido para llevarnos adelante a trav&#233;s de las tormentas y navegar tras el paso de estas. Un&#225;monos una vez m&#225;s en apoyo unos de otros y para levantar a aquellos que m&#225;s lo necesiten.</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span>En comunidad,</span></p>

<p><a href="https://labor.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Center for Labor and Community </a>will be modeled after existing centers at <a href="https://www.labor.ucla.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UCLA,</a> <a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Berkeley,</a> and <a href="https://clc.ucmerced.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Merced</a> and builds upon previous efforts on campus dedicated to studying low-wage work, the affordable housing crisis, and the challenges of the rapidly-changing economy. The new center, housed in the <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Institute for Social Transformation,</a> aims&#160;to build the power of working people in Santa Cruz County and beyond by promoting, defending, and expanding workers&#8217; rights. Through research, advocacy, policy innovation, education, and outreach, the center supports unions, worker organizations, and community groups in their efforts to build a fair and racially just worker-centered economy. In addition, the center will create an advisory board and work with local labor councils to develop timely research initiatives.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are excited to finally have this space on our campus because we&#8217;ve known for years that workers and communities in our region struggle for justice and dignity across a broad range of issues,&#8221; said Steve McKay, associate professor of sociology and the faculty director at the new center. &#8220;Now, more than ever, we need to ensure that local workers&#8217; and community living conditions are part of the statewide economic recovery conversation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding for the new center at UC Santa Cruz was formed as part of a historic allocation in California&#8217;s 2022-23 budget passed last summer. The budget included $13 million to expand such programs across the University of California. UC Santa Cruz received $500,000 this year for its campus site.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At UCSC, this funding also will expand undergraduate labor education by providing educational opportunities for students to be involved in labor and community-based research, as well as to serve local labor and community organizations through paid summer internships.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to launch a new program, </span><a href="https://labor.ucsc.edu/883-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor Summer,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will support up to 10 UC Santa Cruz undergraduates with stipends of $5,000 each, connecting them directly to labor and community organizations for an 8-week immersive and hands-on internship,&#8221; said Chris Benner, one of the center&#8217;s faculty founders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar efforts to open new labor centers are underway at UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, and UC Irvine. Similar centers are under discussion at UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego. The allocation represents the single largest budget increase to UC labor centers since the creation of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment in 1946 and the founding of the UCLA and UC Berkeley Labor Centers in 1964.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This funding was made possible through the collaborative efforts of the California Labor Federation, key labor unions throughout the state, and elected officials, including California State Sen. Mar&#237;a Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood), Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins (D-San Diego) and Assemblymember Mike Fong (D-Los Angeles).&#160;</span></p>

She was joining her advisor Rachel Meyer, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, as part of the first team on the ground for a large international project called <span><a href="https://www.bioscape.io/">BioSCape</a></span>.</p>
<p>BioSCape is run by NASA in collaboration with the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) and the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), as well as other international partners. It aims at combining cutting-edge technology like airborne imaging spectroscopy and lidar remote sensing with field observations to better understand the biodiversity of South Africa&#8217;s Greater Cape Floristic Region.</p>
<p>BioSCape is engaging over a dozen different teams to measure everything from soundscapes to levels of phytoplankton in the Greater Cape Region to better understand the role that biodiversity plays in South Africa&#8217;s ecosystem. Together, the groups will help NASA create a model for measuring biodiversity changes after disturbances such as wildfires, flooding, species invasion, and climate change.</p>
<h2>Tracking biodiversity</h2>
<p>Meyer and Slimp&#8217;s role in the BioSCape project is to collect environmental DNA (eDNA) samples along two rivers that run through the Cape. eDNA is a relatively new method for monitoring biodiversity that involves taking soil or water samples from a location of interest, then analyzing those samples in the lab to determine what kind of DNA is present. eDNA only lasts for an average of two weeks before it is degraded, so analyzing what is in the samples gives researchers a good view into what species currently inhabit a given area.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional methods of monitoring species&#8217; presence in a region, which require many hours of observation over a long period of time, eDNA techniques can provide a very clear picture of the biodiversity of an area relatively inexpensively and with only a few site visits. In addition to collecting eDNA for the BioSCape project, Meyer and other scientists in the <span><a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Paleogenomics Lab</a></span> have a number of collaborations with national parks using eDNA to help park managers better understand the areas they are trying to conserve. Their projects have included tracing harmful algal blooms in Alaska, monitoring watersheds in Hawaii, and tracking biodiversity near the Los Angeles River.</p>
<p>During their trip to the Cape, Slimp and Meyer were joined by several other South African researchers and volunteers to collect samples. They traveled to a total of 34 sites, 30 along a large river called the Berg and four along the smaller Eerste River. The Berg stretches along a diverse landscape that runs from an undeveloped to an urban gradient, much like the Los Angeles River that has been the subject of many previous eDNA excursions. It runs through citrus farms and wineries, and many farmers rely on it to water their crops.</p>
<p>Meyer and Slimp spent more than three weeks in South Africa visiting the collection sites. Some were easily accessible, but others required climbing down 70-degree slopes and wading through rivers to collect their samples. Once their extractions are analyzed, they expect them to reveal which organisms live in and around the Berg and Eerste, and how biodiversity is organized along the river systems. The different sizes of the two rivers will also help them to determine if this organization is scale-dependent.</p>
<h2>Adjusting to fieldwork</h2>
<p>Because eDNA data needs to be sampled at two different times, both during and after the rainy season, Meyer and her team were the first on the ground for the BioSCape project. This was exciting but came with some challenges, particularly in learning how to communicate the mission of the project to farmers at sites where they wanted to collect data.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge that I think both Rachel and I had was being outsiders to the culture and political atmosphere of South Africa,&#8221; Slimp said. &#8220;Being respectful of the culture matters a lot for international research. Listening to the stories of our collaborators has been really important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slimp and Meyer said they felt lucky to have been joined by South African university students and botanists who helped them navigate both the immense biodiversity of the area as well as cultural sensitivities, particularly when asking farmers for permission to take samples on their land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the farmers ended up being very receptive,&#8221; Slimp said. &#8220;They were interested in the project, and when we finished at a site they wanted to know what we found and what was interesting about their land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meyer said that her team was committed to ethically representing South Africa&#8217;s interests in their research. For example, the team completes all the DNA extractions from their samples while they are still in South Africa so the samples will stay regulated by South Africa and not the United States.</p>
<p>She is planning to share some of the lessons they learned along the way with other BioSCape partners at a BioSCape conference in May. Many of the other teams have not yet had a chance to collect their samples, and Meyer is hoping that what they share will help them to be more prepared to communicate their own projects in the field. There are also many changing policies that shape how to share access to the collections and data, and how to share benefits from the project. At the conference in May, Meyer and Slimp will be running a session with South African BioSCape teams on benefit sharing and bioethics.</p>
<h2>Processing the samples</h2>
<p>Meyer and Slimp will embark on a second round of data collection in South Africa in October. In the meantime, there is plenty of work to do processing the extractions that they collected from their first expedition. To learn what is in them, they will match up the DNA they find in their samples with a catalog of &#8220;barcodes&#8221; of known species.</p>
<p>Barcoding efforts such as the California Conservation Genomics Project and the California Institute for Biodiversity partnerships, which UCSC participates in, have been making large strides in sequencing the genomes and barcodes of as many species as possible so researchers like Slimp can do this type of work. These barcodes are making eDNA an ever-more reliable method for identifying and monitoring biodiversity, even in an area that is as diverse as the South African Greater Cape.</p>
<h2>Learning leadership<strong><br/></strong></h2>
<p>While a large overseas data collection trip certainly had its challenges, Slimp said she is very grateful for how it helped her develop as a researcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a big growth experience,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It took a lot of strength that I didn&#8217;t know I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slimp was working with two volunteers who had just completed their master&#8217;s degrees, Jabulile Malindi from the University of the Western Cape and Ayesha Hargey from the University of Cape Town. Malindi contributed her knowledge on fynbos flora, and Hargey became an expert in eDNA collection, but both were new to eDNA and Bioscape. This placed Slimp in a position of leadership as a teacher.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to step away from being a student and think of the project,&#8221; Slimp said. &#8220;I have led things before in lab and small-scale data collection, but it was certainly a challenge to have people relying on me for direction, for information, to be a leader. I feel like I am capable of so much more now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really excited to go back,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I just feel so inspired by everyone on the BioSCape team.&#8221;</p>

<p>The object (called VHS 1256b) is a brown dwarf&#8212;a substellar object that is like a gas giant planet in most respects. The spectrum, which separates the light from the object into its component wavelengths, provides a wealth of information, including evidence of a dynamic atmosphere with clouds of silicate crystals (like hot sand condensing in the atmosphere). A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00620">paper on the new findings</a> has been accepted for publication in <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The richness of information in the spectrum is amazing&#8212;there&#8217;s never been a spectrum of an exoplanet like this before,&#8221; said coauthor Andrew Skemer, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>First author Brittany Miles worked on the study with Skemer as a UCSC graduate student and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Arizona. Skemer is a co-principal investigator of the JWST Early Release Science (ERS) program for direct observations of exoplanetary systems. His team at UCSC has led the first two papers from the program, reporting JWST&#8217;s <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/exoplanet-images.html">first direct image of an exoplanet</a> in September and now its first direct spectrum of a planetary-mass object.</p>
<p>The planet is about 40 light-years away and orbits two stars over a 10,000-year period. &#8220;VHS 1256 b is about four times farther from its stars than Pluto is from our sun, which makes it a great target for Webb,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;That means the planet&#8217;s light is not mixed with light from its stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skemer explained that the main goal of the ERS programs is to test out the telescope&#8217;s instruments in all their observing modes and demonstrate their technical capabilities. The team chose VHS 1256b for the first direct spectrum because it is widely separated from its companions and is known to be similar to other gas giant exoplanets.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the ERS program, we&#8217;re learning how to use the telescope to do science, but of course we&#8217;re seeing new things while we&#8217;re doing that, and that&#8217;s especially the case with this spectrum,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are so many features in the spectrum, it allows us to probe different depths of the atmosphere and really see a full picture of the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spectrum was obtained using two spectrographic instruments, NIRSpec and MIRI, which combined to provide extremely precise measurements over a very broad range of infrared wavelengths (from 1 to 20 microns). The features observed in VHS 1256b&#8217;s atmosphere include water, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sodium, and potassium.</p>
<p>The methane features are not as strong as expected compared to similar objects, which Skemer said is the result of vigorous mixing of the atmosphere and chemical reactions leading to depletion of methane.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a highly dynamic atmosphere, with strong upwelling of hot gases, which are also condensing to form these silicate clouds,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to Miles, the team has only begun to explore all the information contained in the spectrum. &#8220;We&#8217;ve identified silicates, but better understanding which grain sizes and shapes match specific types of clouds is going to take a lot of additional work,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;This is not the final word on this planet&#8212;it is the beginning of a large-scale modeling effort to fit Webb&#8217;s complex data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Previous ground-based observations had indicated that the luminosity of VHS 1256b is highly variable, increasing and decreasing in brightness by as much as 25 percent. Skemer said this variability is related to the silicate clouds and atmospheric turbulence.</p>
<p>VHS 1256b is relatively young (less than 300 million years), and its wide separation from its companion suggests that it did not form like a typical exoplanet. The spectroscopic analysis confirmed that its mass is less than 20 times that of Jupiter, but the researchers could not determine if it is above or below the mass often used as a dividing line between exoplanets and brown dwarfs (about 13 Jupiter masses). It does, however, have a very planet-like spectrum.</p>
<p>&#8220;It probably didn&#8217;t form like a planet, but it looks like a planet,&#8221; Skemer said.</p>
<p>The new observations of VHS 1256b provide a foundation for future spectroscopic observations of gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs with JWST, which will provide new insights into the physics and chemistry of their atmospheres.</p>
<p>The direct imaging ERS team includes more than 100 astronomers at institutions around the world. About 40 of them had gathered at UCSC for a summer workshop at the Other Worlds Laboratory in July, when the first data from JWST became available. Skemer, Miles, and UCSC postdoctoral scholar Aarynn Carter had been working together for years preparing for that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew what we wanted to do,&#8221; Skemer said. &#8220;Having people here for the OWL workshop made it easier to coordinate with everyone so they could contribute to different parts of the analysis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other UCSC astronomers involved in this work include Jonathan Fortney, Sagnick Mukherjee, Bruce Macintosh, and Callie Hood, as well as Xi Xhang in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.</p>

As major tech companies develop their own GPUs which are used in devices such as computers and phones, tests need to be put in place to ensure software can be run safely and efficiently across the various processors.&#160;<br/><br/>That&#8217;s where UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Tyler Sorensen and his team of colleagues and student researchers step in. Sorensen&#8217;s team creates tests to ensure that programming languages can run correctly and safely across the diverse range of processors that different companies are producing. This contributes to the overall stability of the processors that are deployed on our computers and phones as they are being tasked to do increasingly important tasks such as facial recognition.&#160;<br/><br/>A <a href="https://reeselevine.github.io/assets/pdf/mc_mutants.pdf">new paper</a> details a suite of tests to assess how GPUs implement programming languages. This work was led by Sorensen&#8217;s Ph.D. student Reese Levine along with UCSC undergraduates Mingun Cho and Tianhao Guo, UCSC Assistant Professor Andrew Quinn, and collaborators at Google. Levine will present the work at the <a href="https://asplos-conference.org/">2023 ASPLOS conference</a>, a premier computer systems conference.<br/><br/>In developing and running these tests they discovered significant bugs in a major GPU, leading to changes to an important GPU framework for programming web browsers.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a company and you want to implement this language so that people can program your GPU, we&#8217;re giving you a really good way to test it, and even a scorecard on how well it was tested,&#8221; Sorensen said. &#8220;People are always saying this is a very difficult part of the programming language to reason about &#8212; some people have even called it the rocket science of computer science.&#8221;<br/><br/>In this paper, the researchers tested GPUs specifically on desktop devices from major companies such as Apple, Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD.&#160;<br/><br/>Through these tests, the team found a bug in an AMD compiler, a program that translates code written in one programming language into another language. This discovery led AMD to confirm the bug and fix the problem on their devices.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This behavior was so unexpected that they changed the programming language to adapt to our observations,&#8221; Sorensen said.<br/><br/>Moreover, this led to a change in a major GPU programming framework called WebGPU, an important tool used by programmers to ensure that web browsers can accelerate web pages using new GPU technologies.<br/><br/>&#8220;Everytime you run Chrome, you know you're running a version that's passed our tests,&#8221; Levine said.&#160;<br/><br/>The tests developed by the team also uncovered a GPU bug on the Google Pixel 6. That bug has been confirmed, and Google has committed to fixing it. These results are discussed in another paper from Sorensen&#8217;s group, which is currently under submission. In their ongoing research, they recently deployed their tools and methodology to test over 100 different GPU devices.&#160;<br/><br/>In order to surface these bugs, the researchers use mathematical models of the programming languages to guide their tests toward interesting areas of the GPU where bugs have historically been lurking elusively.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;How do you know your tests are working, and how do you know they're actually testing the right parts of the system?&#8221; Levine said. &#8220;We use mathematical models to provide confidence that these tests are performing as they should.&#8221;<br/><br/>Going forward, the researchers plan to use their tests on more devices, particularly on mobile phones, to ensure programming languages can be executed safely and efficiently.&#160;<br/><br/>This research was supported through a gift from Google.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="05365e9d807270465b1e58f4bc64a6fc"><name>homebuyer-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>The State of California offers a new program to help first-time homebuyers</title><summary>The California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) under Governor Newsom is launching a new program to benefit first-time homebuyers.</summary><start-date>1679382000000</start-date><path>/2023/03/homebuyer-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/homebuyer-program</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1679419661964</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1679419661964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Nikki Vamosi</name><title></title><phone/><email>nvamosi@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) under Governor Newsom is launching a new program to benefit first-time homebuyers. The California Dream for All program will provide homebuyers who meet the qualifications with down payment support on the purchase of a California home. The program offers upwards of 20 percent of the purchase price or appraised value (whichever is lower) in the form of a shared-appreciation loan. The loan can be utilized as a down payment or towards closing costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As home prices have continued to escalate throughout California, it has become increasingly difficult for homeowners to secure sufficient funds for a down payment. Conventional home loans often require a 20 percent down payment from the buyer. Anything less generally results in a higher interest rate and, potentially, the requirement for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI), which significantly increases costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Dream for All program provides a lending vehicle to avoid that situation. Used in conjunction with a Dream For All Conventional mortgage, the program is a shared appreciation&#160; product where the State of California provides the homebuyer a down payment loan. The homebuyer agrees to repay the loan plus 20 percent of the appreciation of the home value. The homebuyer pays when they sell or transfer the home to a new lender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home equity is a proven vehicle for families to generate and pass on wealth. The California Housing Finance Agency developed the program in an effort to improve equitable access to homeownership.</span></p>

This act required all postsecondary institutions participating in HEA&#8217;s Title IV student financial assistance programs to disclose campus crime statistics and security information. The law was renamed in 1998 as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (the Clery Act) in memory of Jeanne Clery, a student slain in her dorm room in 1986 by a fellow Lehigh University student who unlawfully entered her residence hall with the intention of burglarizing rooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clery Act and its related regulations require colleges and universities to disclose crime statistics, issue campus alerts and warning notices, publish an annual security report, keep a crime log, provide educational programs and campaigns, disclose procedures for institutional disciplinary actions, and submit specified crime statistics to the Department of Education. Because UC Santa Cruz has on-campus student housing facilities, the University must also disclose missing student notification procedures and fire safety information (i.e., publish an annual fire safety report, keep a fire log, and submit fire statistics to the Department of Education).&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California Office of the President invites comments on the </span><a href="https://ucscpolicy.ellucid.com/documents/view/172"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interim Clery Act Policy &#8211; Campus Safety and Security Reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy was approved on an interim basis in July 2022 and is now open for comment as a part of the final approval process. Following the interim issuance, a Systemwide Clery Policy Working Group was formed that included representation from campus Chief Compliance &amp; Ethics Officers, Clery Coordinators, CARE Offices, Ombuds, Title IX, Community Safety, and UC Legal. The working group conducted workshops with key stakeholder groups to gather feedback on the interim Policy, compile additional feedback on the policy, and begin the development of implementation guidance. The revisions include the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conforming with the formal text of the Clery Act and the Department of Education&#8217;s recent directives and enforcement cases.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
<ul>
<li>Removal of the language regarding the categorical exemption of all CARE Advocates, Ombuds, and all other confidential campus offices as Campus Security Authority (CSA), and a clarification that employees with responsibilities within the scope of their license, as professional or pastoral counselors, are not CSAs for the purposes of this Policy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Coastal scientists, insurance industry experts, and representatives of state and federal agencies came together at the meeting to address challenges and opportunities for building coastal resilience to climate change. The flooding from a levee breach in nearby Pajaro served as a somber reminder of the urgency of the issues they had gathered to discuss.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a tendency to think of climate change as a future problem and the impacts as happening elsewhere, but climate change is a here-and-now problem, and we&#8217;ve got to start adapting and working to reduce the risks,&#8221; said Michael Beck, director of the UCSC Center for Coastal Climate Resilience.</p>
<p>The two-day symposium was a collaboration between UC Santa Cruz, the California Ocean Science Trust, the California Department of Insurance, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering with Nature initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Science has told us for decades now that nature is a powerful ally in protecting our coasts from climate change impacts," said Liz Whiteman, executive director of the California Ocean Science Trust. &#8220;The symposium&#8217;s goal was to connect the insurance sector, the scientific community, and decision makers so that they can work in partnership to build climate resilience for California&#8217;s coastal communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shifting the focus of insurance from its familiar role in post-disaster recovery to pre-disaster preparation is a new area of action for researchers and government leaders. In his opening remarks, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara noted that every county in California has experienced a flood emergency in the past 20 years, and he emphasized the need to provide risk reduction that has community level benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Climate change is increasing the threat to Californians who can least afford the cost of rebuilding. While we can expand protection for Californians through traditional property insurance, we also need to think creatively about what I call climate insurance to protect entire communities well in advance,&#8221; said Commissioner Lara, who issued the first-ever <a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/cci/">report of the California Climate Insurance Working Group</a> in 2021. &#8220;Nature can be our first and best line of defense from climate change, reducing risks and increasing financial protection at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Engineering with Nature</h2>
<p>Jeff King, the lead for Engineering with Nature at USACE, said collaboration with UC Santa Cruz, including on the development of the <a href="https://ewn.erdc.dren.mil/?page_id=4351">International Guidelines on Natural and Nature-Based Features for Flood Risk Management</a>, has helped change how engineers design and work with nature instead of just harnessing it. &#8220;We are excited that UCSC has joined the Network for Engineering with Nature partnership and look forward to more great work together on nature-based solutions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Beck is a leading expert on the role of coastal habitats in reducing the risk of flooding. He has done extensive work with the insurance industry to put a dollar value on the risk reduction provided by marshes, mangroves, and coral reefs, and his research has demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of habitat restoration projects for coastal flood protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you can put a dollar value on the protection provided by natural ecosystems, that&#8217;s when insurance can get involved,&#8221; said Lindsay Judd, senior environmental underwriter at AXA XL.</p>
<p>The symposium brought together key parties to build partnerships and collaborations between different sectors and help speed the integration of nature into risk management and insurance. Participants included officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well as experts with the insurance industry and nonprofits such as The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Conservation International.</p>
<h2>Incentivizing Adaptation</h2>
<p>In a panel on &#8220;Incentivizing Adaptation,&#8221; Heather Tallis, assistant director for biodiversity and conservation sciences at the White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy, highlighted efforts to accelerate the use of nature-based solutions across federal agencies laid out in the Biden administration&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nature-Based-Solutions-Roadmap.pdf">Roadmap</a> for addressing climate change.</p>
<p>On a more local level, TNC&#8217;s Sarah Heard described a policy brief released that day on the flood reduction benefits of salt marsh restoration in San Francisco Bay, which she worked on with Beck and UCSC graduate student Rae Taylor-Burns. The report, &#8220;<a href="https://www.scienceforconservation.org/products/Salt-Marsh-Flood-Benefits">Valuing the Flood Reduction Benefits of Marsh Restoration</a>,&#8221; summarizes the results of a high-resolution study to quantify the flood risk reduction benefits of salt marsh restoration in San Mateo County and to identify where restoration could have the greatest socio-economic impacts in reducing flood risk.</p>
<p>Beck has also been working with the <a href="https://oceanriskalliance.org/">Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance</a> to develop a Coastal Risk Index, which maps flooding along the world&#8217;s coastlines to show where communities are most at risk and where nature-based solutions can play a role in reducing this risk. ORRAA&#8217;s Chip Cunliffe said the organization is working to develop novel financial products to drive investment in nature-based solutions for ocean and coastal resilience.</p>
<p>Investing in risk reduction and climate adaptation projects before extreme climate events trigger new natural disasters is far more cost-effective than the trillions of dollars spent on disaster recovery efforts, Beck said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not yet at a tipping point where nature is being consistently integrated into risk management and insurance, but we are making progress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Getting leading risk agencies and insurance firms together to brainstorm transformative new approaches is key to bridging this gap, particularly for our most vulnerable communities in a changing climate.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0b64ac98807270462d0e5d7721f9889f"><name>spring2023-emeriti-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Spring 2023 Emeriti Lecture: Peace Teachers In and From Soledad Prison</title><summary>John Brown Childs began offering courses on transcommunality at Soledad Correctional Facility eighteen years ago.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighteen years ago, distinguished UCSC Professor Emeritus John Brown Childs began offering courses at Soledad Correctional Facility. His &#8220;Transcommunal Peacemaking and Cooperation&#8221; class has become a necessary part of dozens of incarcerated men&#8217;s rehabilitation at Soledad Prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcommunality is rooted in the Native American philosophy of unity and diversity created by the peacemaker Deganawidah in the early 15th century. At Soledad, concepts within transcommunality, such as &#8220;constructive disputing&#8221; and &#8220;working together,&#8221; have resonated with inmates the most. Childs says that since the course&#8217;s inception almost two decades ago, the original students have become the teachers of transcommunality within Soledad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The men with whom I work have a very positive, very proactive sense of self-determination,&#8221; Childs said. &#8220;They want to do well, they want to do good, and so they were already moving in that direction themselves. What I found I could offer was a sustaining resource framework for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Childs says that those who participated in the courses while incarcerated have a zero recidivism rate. In addition, many that leave Soledad go on to work in community and civic organizations, supporting school systems, and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that in times of hatred, violence, and mistrust in the nation and worldwide, the Soledad Peace Teachers offer key examples of non-violence and mutually respectful cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They believe in the peacemaking message of transcommunality, and they try very much to enact it in their lives,&#8221; Childs said. &#8220;And given that they have come out of tough circumstances, transforming their lives personally into positive ones is a great development.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>On April 11 at 6:30 pm, Childs will present at&#160; the Spring 2023 Emeriti Faculty Lecture, &#8220;Peace Teachers In and From Soledad Prison,&#8221; where he will speak about his experience teaching transcommunality to the inmates of Soledad and will showcase a video taken by the students.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They have pushed the idea of transcommunality out even further in ways that I hadn&#8217;t thought about,&#8221; Childs said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it work inside the prison over and over again in a very positive and affirming way.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 Childs earned the University of California&#8217;s system-wide highest honor for emeriti faculty, the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award. He is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Sarker received a foundation grant fund from </span><a href="https://cgmf.org/p/home.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, amounting to $170,947 over three years to strengthen his lab&#8217;s ecological aquaculture work. The funding was &#8220;unsolicited,&#8221; said Sarker, but stemmed from his professional relationship with one of the Foundation&#8217;s board members Dr. Greg Mitchell, who advocated for Sarker to the Board to receive funding for his projects at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Foundation, established in 1978, has distributed or pledged an estimated $900 million in grants toward issues relating to sustainability across the U.S., with a goal to ensure long-term human and ecosystem well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker &#8212; who first joined UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Environmental Studies department in 2019 &#8212; has worked diligently throughout his career to research shifting aquaculture, the world&#8217;s fastest growing food sector, in relation to sustainability surrounding aquafeeds. As he explained, shifting aquafeeds toward more sustainable ingredients helps the life cycle of environmental effects on aquaculture, and can change the future of aquaculture diets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aquaculture is increasingly dependent on terrestrial crops,&#160;such as soy and corn, and wild fish for feeds,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That can be damaging to aquatic ecosystems&#8230;especially when aquafeeds now use over 70% of the world&#8217;s fishmeal and fish oil for unsustainably sourced forage fish.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is paired with the challenges for fish to digest the feeds, Sarker explained. Fish cannot digest the majority of the crops&#8217; phosphorus, which leads to phosphorous emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address that issue, Sarker&#8217;s team at UC Santa Cruz is working on circular economy research, aiming to reuse nutrient-rich aquaculture water to grow vegetables at </span><a href="https://kapsar.sites.ucsc.edu/circular-economies-for-aquatic-food-systems/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Ecological Aquaculture facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://agroecology.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Center for Agroecology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aquaculture has found its popularity rise in recent years, as scientists look to advance the possibilities of its relationship to global food production for the rising population. According to </span><a href="https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/35-greene.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an October 2022 article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by researchers at Cornell University and University of Washington, food production from marine algae-based aquaculture has the potential to contribute more than the total global protein demand projected for 2050. Further, aquaculture offers important nutritional and environmental sustainability advantages relative to terrestrial agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Santa Cruz, Sarker is using microalgae instead of fish meal and fish oil to develop aquafeeds for more sustainable aquaculture. It will help reduce the pressure on&#160; the main components of the &#8220;marine food web,&#8221; including many of the most popular fish options for diners the world over: sardines, anchovies and herring.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, he said, &#8220;we are aiming to develop ocean-friendly and low polluting aquaculture diets for rainbow trout,&#8221; by using underutilized microalgal co-products and leftover biomass after oil extractions in their research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aquaculture is the fastest growing sector, and this rapid growth increases environmental impacts and feed inputs,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant from the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation accounts for only one of the two USDA grants Sarker is currently overseeing, with the other grant amounting to $1 million. With the funding from these groups, Sarker&#8217;s main objective is to develop new protein ingredients by converting micro-algae industries and large volumes of underutilized co-products into value-added ingredients, which are both cost viable and environmentally beneficial, toward the rainbow trout feed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This work advances the nutritional and economic feasibility of an environmentally sustainable aquaculture diet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is the key success factor for growth in the United States&#8217; and in California&#8217;s aquaculture industries.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, Sarker has been able to share some of his work with the global sustainability communities through Mitchell to the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation. He attended and lectured on his research at the Algae Biomass Summit in 2021, one of the largest algae conferences in the world, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and World Aquaculture Society&#160; triennial Algae in Aquafeeds workshop organized by ABO FAAF in 2022. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Sarker also will attend, by invitation of Mitchell, to teach the sustainable aquaculture course and microalgae aquaculture feeds to the students at Prairie View A&amp;M University in the summer of 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward, those experiences have helped set the stage and the funding for Sarker&#8217;s continued research in aquaculture. His lab currently has 10 undergraduate students and one PhD candidate working together, all of whom Sarker says are &#8220;very passionate&#8221; about the research, which makes the process all the more enjoyable and important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So many students learn about the sustainability of aquaculture and our research here at the UCSC farm&#8230;that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important for us to integrate aquaculture into the conversation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Community engagement is huge &#8212;&#160;this work has a huge impact on our understanding of aquaculture and how we can work together into the future.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="186f58098072704669e26ffcc0ac3dfc"><name>pedroza-rsf-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Pedroza received Russell Sage Foundation Pipeline Grant</title><summary>Assistant Professor Juan Manuel Pedroza aims to learn more about these challenges and speak to them, with the help of a recently awarded grant from the Russell Sage Foundation.</summary><start-date>1679727600000</start-date><path>/2023/03/pedroza-rsf-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/pedroza-rsf-grant</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1679742162935</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1679742162935</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Grace Stetson</name><title></title><phone/><email>grace.stetson@gmail.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/03/pedroza-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/03/pedroza-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pedroza-350.jpg</name><display-name>pedroza-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>52471</file-size><width>350</width><height>466</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/03/pedroza.thumbnail.png</path><link>site://news/2023/03/pedroza.thumbnail.png</link><site>news</site><name>pedroza.thumbnail.png</name><display-name>pedroza.thumbnail.png</display-name><file-size>19421</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Juan Pedroza is an&#160;Assistant Professor of sociology at&#160;UC Santa Cruz,&#160;where he studies the changing landscape of immigration in the United States.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child care has become a much greater expense for families across the United States in recent years, but what are the additional challenges for mixed-status families?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Professor Juan Manuel Pedroza aims to learn more about these challenges and speak to them, with the help of </span><a href="https://www.russellsage.org/research/pipeline-grants-competition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recently awarded grant from the Russell Sage Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Foundation, in partnership with the Economic Mobility and Opportunity program at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, seeks to increase innovative research advancements on economic mobility and access to opportunity nationally. The grants are focused on supporting early-career scholars &#8212;&#160;those currently serving as Assistant or Adjunct Assistant Professors, and lecturers who received their Ph.D. after January 1, 2013 &#8212;&#160;and aims to promote diversity through underrepresented scholars in the social sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Pedroza will be one of approximately 20 awardees, receiving a $30,000 grant toward his research efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedroza, who started at UCSC back in July 2018, primarily studies the changing immigration landscape nationwide through his role in the Sociology Department. In his most recent work, Pedroza has examined inequalities against immigrant populations related to access to justice, the social safety net, poverty, and segregation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his most recently funded work, he&#8217;s extending his long-standing examination of mixed-status families across the U.S. to how much time parents and family members devote to child care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are plenty of families who can afford to pay for after-school care, child care, or infant care,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if you don&#8217;t have the resources, and child care responsibilities are unevenly distributed, then we want to know which gaps exist when it comes to time devoted to child care. In this project, I&#8217;ll be focusing on immigrant families and how child care responsibilities compare to other families.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedroza has studied child care choices among low-income families. As a research associate at the Urban Institute, he worked with a team of public policy researchers to examine </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/child-care-choices-low-income-working-families"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child care constraints</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in both Seattle, Washington and Providence, Rhode Island. With nearly 14 years of research, Pedroza emphasizes that he has taken this study about both child care and its place in &#8220;making ends meet&#8221; very seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Depending on what part of the country you&#8217;re in, child care can be like paying a second rent or second mortgage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Given that child care is getting more expensive, there are going to be people who simply can&#8217;t afford it &#8212;&#160;and that may be creating separate realities for people at the low end of the income spectrum, which includes many immigrant families.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From all of this, Pedroza asks: &#8220;To what extent is the time that you devote to making child care decisions look different for immigrant populations? If it does, then I want to measure those differences by comparing different types of families and child care trends over time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His previous work has shown that, for many Latin American-origin families with long histories of migration initiated by men, it is common for women and mothers to provide child care. The RSF pipeline grant will allow him to document if those trends have persisted or if they are shifting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward to next steps, Pedroza plans to spend this summer diving further into this work across the U.S. He will be working&#160; to analyze child care trends in the 2000s and 2010s using&#160; </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the American Time Use Survey,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a self-reported nationwide survey measuring the amount of time individuals spend on varied activities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this work, Pedroza will then present his findings to the RSF and other grantees at an annual conference in the summer of 2024. Pedroza is excited for this opportunity not only for his own research, but for that of his peers. The Grant funds a cohort of early career scholars and connects grantees with mentors and a broader network of scholars studying inequality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For young career scholars like myself, there&#8217;s a lot of ideas that we would like to pursue and a lot of exciting directions for research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But there&#8217;s only so much time and bandwidth &#8212;&#160;this grant allows me to carve out the time and space to do that work.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="245a58f08072704654cb0bcfc9f5343b"><name>puma-survival-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Humans and housing density are the leading cause of death for local pumas</title><summary>Two new studies involving UC Santa Cruz researchers are shedding light on the challenges facing local pumas where humans are encroaching on their natural habitats.&#13;

<p>Anna Nisi, a former graduate researcher for the <a href="http://www.santacruzpumas.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Cruz Puma Project</a>, examined 11 years of research regarding the movement, mortality, and reproductive data for 67 pumas in the Santa Cruz mountains for a paper that recently appeared in <em><a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eap.2822" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ecological Applications.</a>&#160;</em>The study looked at how exposure to human development impacted puma survival and population dynamics.&#160;</p>
<p>Nisi&#8217;s research found that pumas who live in areas with more human development have lower survival rates, with female pumas being more affected than males. Female pumas have an 18% decrease in survival rates in areas with higher human development. This has consequences for puma population dynamics - in other words, whether we can expect the puma population to increase or decrease over time.&#160;</p>
<p>"This study shows that minimizing further development in remote areas that are high-quality habitats for pumas is really important to make sure that the puma population can continue to live here into the future,&#8221; said Nisi.</p>
<p>Because adult female pumas do more poorly in areas with more human development, these places can&#8217;t support puma population growth. Much of the study area - 42% - fits that description. While this study estimates that the Santa Cruz Mountain puma population is stable, further development in remote areas could tip the balance and lead to a population decline. This study underscores that high-quality, remote habitats in the Santa Cruz Mountains should be protected for long-term puma population persistence.</p>
<p>A second paper for <em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220030120" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PNAS,</a>&#160;</em>that Nisi and environmental studies professor Chris Wilmers co-authored with John Benson from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, looks at broad-scale patterns of survival and human-caused mortality for pumas in California. (Pumas are also referred to locally as mountain lions.) The PNAS study, which studied 590 mountain lions in 23 areas across California, including Santa Cruz, found that mountain lions were at greater risk of mortality from humans when they were closer to rural development. This study also found that human-caused mortality is additive to mortality from natural sources.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O</span>ne of the contributing factors is the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), which has greatly impacted puma mortality, according to environmental studies professor Chris Wilmers, who leads the Puma Project. The Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) is the area where human development and wildland vegetation meet, and in recent years it has expanded rapidly due to population growth and land use policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chronic exposure to housing increases mortality risk in pumas, and that goes to how we&#8217;ve developed the landscape as a society,&#8221; Wilmers said. &#8220;The WUI has been super lethal to our wildlife and has become a major environmental problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The PNAS study found that while mountain lions have been protected from hunting, conflict with humans over livestock and collisions with vehicles also contribute to their mortality. The study&#8217;s results speak to the need for greater puma conservation efforts in human-dominated areas, said Wilmers, as well as the need to protect puma habitats and manage human development to minimize their impact on pumas in the future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2572fdb48072704654cb0bcf8957b63e"><name>statement-gordon-moore</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Honoring the contributions of Gordon Moore</title><summary>Science has lost one of its greatest champions with the death of Gordon Moore, a visionary engineer whose pioneering work on semiconductors set the stage for a technological revolution that changed the world in countless ways and enabled research breakthroughs in fields far and wide. </summary><start-date>1679900400000</start-date><display-name>Honoring the contributions of Gordon Moore</display-name><path>/2023/03/statement-gordon-moore</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/statement-gordon-moore</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1679960505762</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1679960505762</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/03/images/gordon-and-betty-moore-400px.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/03/images/gordon-and-betty-moore-400px.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gordon-and-betty-moore-400px.jpg</name><display-name>gordon-and-betty-moore-400px.jpg</display-name><file-size>149055</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>Gordon and Betty Moore</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Gordon and Betty Moore</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science has lost one of its greatest champions with the death of Gordon Moore, a visionary engineer whose pioneering work on semiconductors set the stage for a technological revolution that changed the world in countless ways and enabled research breakthroughs in fields far and wide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His genius was only rivaled by his generosity. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, established in 2000 by the Intel Corp. co-founder and his wife, continues to support efforts to create positive outcomes for future generations through its support of environmental conservation and scientific research worldwide. Our campus has been among its many beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last month we announced a $5.4 million grant from the foundation to support a major expansion of Lick Observatory&#8217;s education and outreach programs aimed at reaching a diverse population of students. It was the latest in a long string of impactful donations Moore made to our campus. The Moore Foundation has provided support for UC Santa Cruz research in climate change, ocean health, experimental physics, adaptive optics, marine microbiology and many other fields. We recognized the couple for their longtime support of our campus in 2012 with the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gordon Moore&#8217;s insight and vision changed our world for the better. His philanthropic efforts ensure more scholarly and scientific break-throughs are to come. That is a legacy to celebrate.</span></p>

Starting early can instill a sense of belonging and prepare new admits for success, especially for those who are low-income or first-generation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More than just earning credits, starting before the rush of fall </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduces students to the importance of developing essential relationships with faculty and staff that can enrich their entire academic experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, to advance access to a summer start, the Division of Undergraduate Education has removed the Summer Edge $50 registration fee, which is one of several initiatives taken to encourage new admits, and particularly transfer students, to take advantage of the opportunity to make degree progress before their first fall. By offering the 2-credit academic success course associated with the program, Kresge 25 - </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successful Transfer to the Research University</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, online, in-person, and in multiple sessions, transfer students have greater flexibility than ever before to start early. The removal of the fee is yet another way to open doors for students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An alumna of UC Santa Cruz, Lindsay Osborne, Summer Programs Coordinator of the Summer Session Department, has been working to reduce barriers to the program for all students. &#8220;As a first-generation, low-income student myself, if I ever saw a fee that needed to be paid out-of-pocket, I didn&#8217;t pursue the opportunity because I just couldn&#8217;t afford it.&#160; I don&#8217;t want a fee to stop any student from being successful&#8221;. Working with Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students (STARS) and other campus staff to increase access for transfers and other underserved students helped highlight where a registration fee was discouraging the very populations who could benefit the most from the support the program offers. Cross-campus partnerships are a hallmark of UCSC&#8217;s broad commitment to students as an HSI / ANAAPSI student-serving institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although substantial Financial Aid is available for Summer Edge students, it has been a challenge for low-income transfer students to pay the upfront registration fee,&#8221; said Sara Radoff, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students. &#8220;Transfer Edge is a phenomenal opportunity, and removing this barrier helps us support access for our local community college transfers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Edge is particularly important for transfer students. Summer session works with programs to ensure that key gateway courses are offered in the program, placing transfer students on an equal footing with continuing students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey of 2022 Edge participants found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the majority of students reported significant gains in access to academic services, including writing and homework support and studying for exams.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">96% of first-year and 100% of transfer students would recommend the program to other incoming students. When asked to describe the best part of Summer Edge, students highlighted meeting people or making friends, the activities and events, and getting to learn about campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration for the 2023 summer program is open now for all newly admitted students.&#160;</span></p>

Now as a computational media Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz, part of his research is devoted to the study of adaptive technologies for neurodivergent adults, in addition to his research on human-robot interaction.&#160;<br/><br/>This work has been recognized through the Piatt Fellowship, an annual scholarship award given by the <a href="https://capitolaaptosrotary.org/">Rotary Club of Capitola/Aptos</a> to a UC Santa Cruz Natural Sciences doctoral student who went to a public high school in Santa Cruz County. This scholarship is crucial, he says, in allowing him to continue his education while he raises his daughter locally and sees the cost of living increase.<br/><br/>&#8220;I believe in localized living&#8212;this is where I live, this is where my home is,&#8221; Weatherwax said. &#8220;I think there's a lot of value in encouraging people to be scholars in their own community.&#8221;<br/><br/>Weatherwax&#8217;s connection to the community runs deep. He&#8217;s lived in the area since he was 10; his parents are in the community; his wife, Noelle Stapleton, owns a small business, Ritual Curl Studio, in Santa Cruz; and his daughter is in a safe and supportive educational environment. The Piatt Fellowship is essential to allowing him to maintain these ties and stay in Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s really cool to see a local organization that supports academics in the community, and tries to bridge that gap between the town and the campus,&#8221; Weatherwax said.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Supporting homegrown scholars</strong></p>
<p>Weatherwax is one of the <a href="https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-demand/enrollments.html">409 students</a> currently enrolled at UCSC whose home county is Santa Cruz, and the 10th UCSC student to win the Piatt Fellowship. Members of the Rotary Club of Capitola/Aptos, which is dedicated to service in the community, recently visited campus to see Weatherwax&#8217;s lab and learn more about his work.<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s very rewarding to see what this fellowship can do,&#8221; said Kendra Cleary, co-president of the Rotary Club of Capitola/Aptos. &#8220;It&#8217;s encouraging the best and brightest to make a difference, and to return to our community to learn and make that difference.&#8221;<br/><br/>Weatherwax&#8217;s education has been marked by a series of stops and starts, and his life has been strongly shaped by being neurodivergent. After being expelled from several high schools in Santa Cruz, he dropped out for about a year and ended up graduating late. He struggled with taking college courses, eventually returning to continue his education in his late 20s at Cabrillo College. Through incremental steps, he transferred to UC Santa Cruz, where he got his undergraduate degree and is now pursuing a doctoral degree.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always had to work in ways that are different from how other people work,&#8221; Weatherwax said.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Lo-fi discovery</strong></p>
<p>While he was an undergraduate, he discovered lo-fi music stations on YouTube, smooth hip-hop beats accompanied by a cartoon loop of a character getting back to work. These channels, which were in their infancy in Weatherwax&#8217;s undergrad days, now consistently get tens of thousands of viewers at any given time and have expanded across many platforms.&#160;<br/><br/>Weatherwax noticed that when the character in the video clip would get back to work, it would prompt him to get back to work when he found his attention lolling.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I thought that was really strange, that I was taking behavioral cues from a 10-second animation loop that I would watch all the time,&#8221; Weatherwax said. &#8220;I got really interested in it.&#8221;<br/><br/>With a few friends from the UCSC Computational Media Department, he got started on some passion research looking at lo-fi media as a study tool. This evolved into data collection of chat logs and interviews, which led him to realize that some proportion of the people using lo-fi media were neurodivergent and using it as a form of assistive technology.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This thing helped them to connect to their work, to focus, to be calm and collected, and to have some kind of sense of safety,&#8221; Weatherwax said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot going on there, but it&#8217;s kind of an unknown area.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Neurodivergent connection</strong></p>
<p>Weatherwax continues to be interested in how neurodivergent people may be using lo-fi music and other similar forms of media as a co-opted piece of assistive technology, to provide emotional regulation that may allow them to better focus on work. He especially appreciates how this technology does not try to change the perceived obstacles associated with being neurodivergent.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;The thing with assistive technology and neurodivergence, especially for adults, is that there's not much of it, and it tends to be about trying to train somebody to act neurotypical and overcome or move beyond their neurodivergence.&#8221; Weatherwax said. &#8220;[Lo-fi tech] doesn't try to strip something away from them, it just augments what they've already got going.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Now, he says, you can find a lo-fi station with a cartoon from any cultural, religious, or even political affinity. And theories of body doubling, a strategy for mirroring behavior to increase productivity, offer new ways of understanding why lo-fi stations may be so helpful for some.&#160;<br/><br/>Weatherwax hopes to continue to pursue this area of research, possibly even as a postdoctoral student at UCSC. But currently, his attention and the main thrust of his graduate research is directed toward his other main research interest&#8212;the subtleties of human-robot interaction.&#160;<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>Robot expressiveness</strong></p>
<p>As an undergraduate student, Weatherwax studied psychology and worked for several years as a mental health counselor in Santa Cruz. He brings this social science perspective to his research, which mainly looks at how people perceive and respond to interactive, non-human agents. These could be robots, chatbots, or other forms of interactive artificial intelligence technology, and they are often in a collaborative learning situation with humans.<br/><br/>Weatherwax is particularly interested in how implicit communication, such as intonation, body language, and facial expressions, plays a role in human-robot interactions. He studies both how people may communicate with a robot via these more subtle cues, how those responses can be substituted for more direct feedback from humans, and how robots might be able to express messages back to humans via movement or other ways of expressing intention. He collaborates with clowns, actors, and athletes to learn more about how they convey emotion, and how this could be translated to expressiveness in robots.&#160;<br/><br/>One area Weatherwax is interested in applying this to is crowd navigation&#8212;robots are bad at moving through crowds. He is working to find out how to adapt and adjust pathing behaviors based on people's expressions or body language.<br/><br/>Throughout his time at UCSC, Weatherwax has been appreciative of the mentors who have supported his research and his personal development. Weatherwax is currently co-advised by Assistant Professor of Computational Media Elin Carstensdottir, who advises his research on human-robot interaction, and Assistant Professor of Computational Media Kate Ringland, who supports his research on assistive technology in her Misfit Lab. Previously, he was mentored by Leila Takayama, who was a professor in the computational media department before moving into industry.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I've had incredible luck with advisers,&#8221; Weatherwax said. &#8220;All three of them are just the most lovely people, super supportive and helpful, and great for me as an atypical student.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2943dafb807270467d094b428b6db509"><name>cate-dickens-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Dickens Project honored with the 2023 Award of Merit from the California Association of Teachers of English. </title><summary>The CATE award recognizes the Dickens Project’s long history of outreach and partnerships with high school students and teachers.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Dickens Project also has a long history of outreach programs designed to promote the study and teaching of 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century literature in secondary schools as well as at the university level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the visionaries behind the Dickens Project are being honored for their outreach to high school students and teachers with the 2023 Award of Merit from the California Association of Teachers of English (CATE), which is presented each year to an individual or organization that has made outstanding contributions toward the improvement of teaching English Language Arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award was presented on March 3 at the CATE annual convention, where the Dickens Project was commended for helping high school teachers bring 19th-century literature into their classrooms and for its new Dickens Day of Writing program, which offers classroom curriculum and a day-long writing retreat for high school students, using 19th-century literature as a lens for seeing the contemporary world in new ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We hear often from high school teachers that as much as they wish they could teach Dickens novels, there just isn&#8217;t space in their curriculum for even the shorter works,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ren&#233;e Fox</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Assistant Professor of Literature at UC Santa Cruz and co-director of The Dickens Project. &#8220;The Day of Writing offers teachers a way to bring Dickens into their classrooms in an introductory and low stakes way by providing them with a brief, choose-your-own-adventure curriculum focused on a short Dickens essay.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The 2023 CATE Award not only recognizes the success of the Dickens Project in bringing a younger audience into the world of Dickens,&#8221; John Jordan, Professor of Literature at UCSC and Dickens Project co-director, said. &#8220;The award also points to ways in which that audience has enriched the work of the Project itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From its beginnings back in 1981, the Dickens Project saw high school teachers as important allies in our mission of bringing a greater appreciation of Dickens and other 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century writers to members of the general public, especially to younger readers,&#8221; Jordan said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To this end, The Dickens Project regularly organized workshops for teachers during our annual summer conference, the Dickens Universe, and developed resource handbooks and other curricular materials for use in the schools,&#8221;&#160; Jordan said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Dickens Project has held summer seminars and institutes in Santa Cruz for K&#8211;12 teachers, focusing on novels such as&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great Expectations </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Charles Dickens</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Eyre </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">by&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlotte Bront&#235;,&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and has used film adaptations to introduce Dickens novels to students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dickens Project also partners with the University of Southern California&#8217;s Neighborhood Academic Initiative, a program in South Los Angeles that engages with the work of Jacqueline Barrios, now a professor at the University of Arizona.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the support of the Dickens Project, Barrios spent several years teaching long Dickens novels in her senior English classes and producing creative, public-facing projects that brought these novels into conversation with the lives of her students and their wider community.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2fc2c7958072704639edd7e77ef1dde9"><name>nucleate-partnership</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New program advises UCSC Ph.D. students on their path to entrepreneurship and venture capital</title><summary>Many student-led innovations never make it out of the lab.

<p>The <a href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="https://qb3.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) at UCSC</a>, launched a new fellowship program in 2022 organized through <a href="https://www.nucleate.xyz/activator/ucsc-fellowship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nucleate,&#160;</a>a free and collaborative student-run organization founded at Harvard University with a focus on identifying future &#8220;bioentrepreneurs.&#8221; Nucleate educates and empowers scientists and business students by building bridges within the biotech ecosystem and accelerating the formation of pioneering life sciences companies through its programs. It has a presence in 18 markets across the world, including a robust chapter in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nucleate.xyz/activator/ucsc-fellowship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UCSC Nucleate Innovation Fellowship</a> includes a small cohort of graduate students who receive training and work on technology landscaping, due diligence and sourcing. The students have the opportunity to collaborate with a cohort of peers from other Bay Area universities and network with venture capitalists to brainstorm through challenges in translating cutting-edge science into new ventures. UCSC has had two sets of cohorts that have benefited from collaboration with previous fellows and engagement with the current Nucleate Venture Fellows from the <a href="https://lsec.berkeley.edu/people/venture-fellows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Life Sciences and Entrepreneurship Center</a> at UC Berkeley. The fellowship program lasts five months, and students receive a $4,000 stipend.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was excited to facilitate the new and growing collaboration with the Nucleate Bay Area Chapter to offer unique, innovation-focused experiential learning and leadership opportunities for our talented graduate students, as well as provide another pathway to catalyze the adoption and implementation of life science innovations being advanced by university-associated startups,&#8221; said Ryan Sharp, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Innovation &amp; Business Engagement.</p>
<p>Fellowship recipients choose a target area for mentorship from academic and industry experts and interview companies founded at UCSC or other research universities. The fellows then compile the information into a written report and make a presentation that examines how the companies started, the core technologies involved, the industries they impacted, and the trends they found. After the technology landscape presentations, the fellows transition to technology sourcing, engaging with UCSC researchers, innovations, and entrepreneurs to help navigate the pathway of translating cutting-edge science into new ventures.</p>
<p>Megan Durham, a sixth-year P.h.D. student in Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology who works in Biomolecular Engineering Associate Professor <a href="https://brookslab.soe.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Angela Brooks&#8217; lab</a> and is one of two students in the current fellowship cohort, chose diagnostics as her area of focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am interested in the intersection of science and business, and Nucleate has been helpful to me in making connections,&#8221; Durham said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve met many scientific founders of UC startups and those in the investment field who are happy to talk with me about career prospects.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Graduate students that have applied for the fellowship program also have the opportunity to engage in leadership roles within the Bay Area chapter. Two UCSC students are currently being integrated into the new regional leadership team.</p>
<p>Building on the fellowship collaboration, the Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub recently launched a new partnership with the <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/activator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nucleate Activator program</a>. The Activator program pairs Ph.D. students with MBA students who are interested in launching a business venture. After teams are formed, the students participate together in workshops, are provided with networking and mentorship opportunities, and pitch their venture to a panel of judges.</p>
<p>Tobias Schmid, co-founder of the Nucleate Bay Area Chapter and an expert-in-residence at UC Berkeley, helped to launch UCSC&#8217;s program, which is now in its second year. Participating universities locally also include Berkeley, UC San Francisco, and Stanford.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes us different is that we are student-run and have more than 550 active student volunteers worldwide,&#8221; said Schmid. &#8220;We&#8217;ve helped 250 teams (including 144 in the 2023 cohort) through the process of spinning out of the lab, and teams have raised $202 million so far. We also don&#8217;t take any equity or charge from these student-led ventures, so they remain in control.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Balaji Sundararaman, a sixth-year P.h.D. student in <span>Biomolecular</span>&#160;Engineering who works in the <a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palegenomics Lab,</a> participated in the inaugural UCSC fellowship cohort and is currently participating in the accelerator program to advance his business venture, DABOmics, which is focused on an affordable and less time-consuming way to sequence DNA mutations. BioGenesis Trials, the fourth-place team in the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/sc-launchpad-22.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2022 Santa Cruz Launchpad pitch competition,</a> is also participating in the current accelerator cohort, and OrganOmics, the <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/news/innovative-solutions-pitched-annual-idea-hub-competition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2021 UCSC IDEA Hub pitch contest 3rd place team, </a>was in the inaugural cohort.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The human genome is like a 3,000-page cookbook, and we want to sequence and copy only the pages we need,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sundararaman, a past winner of </span><a href="https://www.santacruzworks.org/news/ucsc-slug-tank-2019-winners-amp-photos" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Tank 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/news/innovative-solutions-pitched-annual-idea-hub-competition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDEA Hub 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with his previous company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GenZ Diagnostics (later Genomics).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;If there&#8217;s an error, it will mess up the recipe.

<p>Ge&#8217;s research focuses on resolving the cloud dynamics of giant planets to inform future space missions and observations. At UCSC, he has been working with Xi Zhang, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences, to study climate and atmospheric dynamics on solar system planets, exoplanets, and brown dwarfs.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 5,000 diverse planets have been discovered in thousands of systems. Understanding the significant role of giant planets in our solar system can help us better characterize worlds beyond,&#8221; Ge said.</p>
<p>The 51 Pegasi b Fellowship provides postdoctoral scientists with the opportunity to conduct theoretical, observational, and experimental research in planetary astronomy, providing up to $415,000 support for independent research over three years. Ge will receive his Ph.D. in planetary science from UCSC in spring 2023.</p>
<p>As a voracious young reader, Ge scoured encyclopedias to learn as much as he could about the planets in our solar system, especially the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. At UCSC, he took part in the development of a breakthrough 3-dimensional cloud-resolving circulation model that simulates how storms function on giant planets and their impact on these massive substellar objects. These simulations helped explain unexpected observations about Jupiter&#8217;s interior and atmosphere from ground-based telescopes and NASA space missions, including Juno and Galileo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have studied the climate on Earth through cloud resolving models for a few decades,&#8221; Ge said. &#8220;Studying Jupiter in this way is a new start. It&#8217;s also a very big challenge, and I like challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his postdoctoral fellowship, Ge will apply his cloud-resolving model to answer further questions about the atmosphere of Jupiter prompted by Juno observations, providing clues to that planet&#8217;s interior structure and evolution. He will also study the cloudy atmosphere of Uranus to inform observations for a future NASA flagship mission to that unexplored planet.</p>
<p>Because the scientific literature suggests similar discrepancies between assumed characteristics of brown dwarfs and those observed from the James Webb Space Telescope, Ge is eager to apply his circulation model to these exoplanets as well, exploring giant-planet dynamics that have sizeable implications for solar systems across the galaxy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really excited for the flagship mission to Uranus,&#8221; he said. &#8220;While there has been a flyby mission there before, we can capture much more detailed data by orbiting this planet. While it will be a long time until we receive the scientific data, that allows me to do more research into what we can observe and discover through this mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Established in 2017, the Heising-Simons Foundation&#8217;s 51 Pegasi b Fellowship is named for the first exoplanet discovered orbiting a sun-like star. The growing field of planetary astronomy studies celestial objects both within and beyond our solar system, bridging planetary science and astronomy. From accelerating our understanding of planetary system formation and evolution in our solar system and beyond, to advancing new technologies for detecting Earth-like worlds, 51 Pegasi b Fellows make unique contributions to the field.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="33fc08638072704673b5c9f012c516da"><name>staff-picnic-save-the-date</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Staff Appreciation Picnic Save the Date and Tabling Information</title><summary>Please save the date for our annual Staff Appreciation Picnic.</summary><start-date>1680159600000</start-date><display-name>Staff Appreciation Picnic Save the Date and Tabling Information</display-name><path>/2023/03/staff-picnic-save-the-date</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/03/staff-picnic-save-the-date</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1680204367737</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1680204367737</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Please save the date for our annual Staff Appreciation Picnic!
