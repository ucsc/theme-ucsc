They are Kasia Jankiewicz, assistant professor of mathematics; Timothy Johnstone, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry; and Tyler Sorensen, assistant professor of computer science and engineering.</p>
<p>The CAREER Awards are NSF's most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. The awards provide funding for five years to support research, education, and outreach activities.</p>
<p>Johnstone received a $770,000 grant to support his work on novel chemical bonds involving heavy elements. Chemical bonding is the bedrock of the understanding of chemistry, and the discovery of new types of bonds opens access to new, often unexpected types of chemical compounds and reactivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;My research focuses on the discovery of new types of highly reactive chemical bonds between elements that are readily abundant on Earth,&#8221; Johnstone explained. &#8220;The new bonds can then be used to make molecules that sustainably perform difficult chemical reactions that have previously required rare precious metals. I am also committed to better understanding the needs of chemistry students that transfer into four-year university programs from the community college system.&#8221;</p>
<p>The educational component of Johnstone&#8217;s project will focus on understanding whether chemical misconceptions, which play a role in the learning of all chemistry students, differ between transfer students and non-transfer students. The project will also test the efficacy of active-learning interventions developed to specifically target these misconceptions.</p>
<p>Jankiewicz received a $550,000 award to support her team&#8217;s research in geometry and topology. &#8220;We will be conducting research in the area of geometric group theory, which studies the connection between the geometry of an object and the algebraic and dynamical properties of its symmetries,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The project will involve studying symmetries of combinatorial objects such as trees (collections of nodes and edges, each connecting a pair of nodes, with no closed loops) and polyhedral complexes (which can be thought of as shapes built out of cubes, tetrahedra, or other polyhedral blocks).</p>
<p>The award will also support an initiative on &#8220;Women in Groups, Geometry, and Dynamics,&#8221; within which Jankiewicz will organize workshops facilitating collaborative learning and research experience for early-career women researchers. In addition, the grant will fund an invited speaker series at UC Santa Cruz, which will expose students to various careers of mathematicians in business, industry, and government.</p>
<p>Sorensen received a $550,000 grant to support his research into improving the collaborative power between different types of specialized processors, with the goal of enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of the systems those processors run. Devices such as phones, tablets, and the computers within cars use multiple processors to carry out the intensive computation required for image processing or speech recognition. While many researchers focus on advancing the specific capabilities of individual processors, Sorensen&#8217;s project focuses on developing the logical frameworks and mathematical models required to enable diverse processors to work together.</p>
<p>The educational component of his project surrounds equitable educational materials for the teaching of graphical processing unit (GPU) programming. Programming GPUs, which form the backbone of many of the advancements in today&#8217;s technology, require expensive computers that are often not accessible to many students. Sorensen wants to rethink the educational framework to make it possible to learn how to program GPUs on cheaper devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Programming GPUs is really tied to very expensive machines, which shuts off educational access except for well-off students,&#8221; Sorensen said. &#8220;So instead, we're looking at new GPU programming frameworks that are available on any commodity desktop and laptop &#8211; but because they&#8217;re not as powerful, they&#8217;re going to be harder to program and understand. We're really going to rethink how we teach GPUs.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="08ea39d38072704656dcccccdb273797"><name>white-dwarf</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Astronomers observe light bending around an isolated white dwarf</title><summary>The first detection of gravitational lensing for a single, isolated star other than our sun comes 100 years after a landmark experiment using the sun to confirm Einstein’s prediction.</summary><keywords>Peter McGill</keywords><start-date>1675346400000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers observe light bending around an isolated white dwarf</display-name><path>/2023/02/white-dwarf</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/02/white-dwarf</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1675186813379</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1675353572292</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Sarah Collins (Cambridge)</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/02/images/lensing-illustration-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/02/images/lensing-illustration-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lensing-illustration-500.jpg</name><display-name>lensing-illustration-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>80881</file-size><width>500</width><height>342</height></image><image-alt>illustration of gravitational lensing</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/02/images/lawd-37-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/02/images/lawd-37-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lawd-37-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>lawd-37-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26723</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>white dwarf and background star</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This artist's illustration shows how the gravity of a foreground white dwarf star warps space and bends the light of a distant star behind it.

<p>The international team used data from two telescopes to measure how light from a distant star bent around a white dwarf known as LAWD 37, causing the distant star to temporarily change its apparent position in the sky.</p>
<p>This is the first time the effect has been detected for a single, isolated star other than our sun, and the first time the mass of such a star has been directly measured. The results are reported in the <em>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>.</p>
<p>LAWD 37 is a white dwarf, the result of the death of a star like our sun. When a star dies, it stops burning its fuel and expels its outer material, leaving only a hot, dense core. Under these conditions, matter as we know it behaves very differently and turns into something called electron-degenerate matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;White dwarfs give us clues into how stars evolve&#8212;someday our own star will end up as a white dwarf,&#8221; said lead author Peter McGill, a postdoctoral scholar at UC Santa Cruz, who carried out the research while completing his Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>LAWD 37 has been extensively studied, as it is relatively close to us. This white dwarf is 15 light years away in the Musca constellation and is what remains of a star that died around 1.15 billion years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this white dwarf is relatively close to us, we&#8217;ve got lots of data on it&#8212;we&#8217;ve got information about its spectrum of light, but the missing piece of the puzzle has been a measurement of its mass,&#8221; said McGill.</p>
<p>Mass is one of the most important factors in a star&#8217;s evolution. For most stellar objects, astronomers infer mass indirectly, relying on strong, often untested modelling assumptions. In rare cases where mass can be directly inferred, the object has to have a companion, such as a binary star system. But for single objects, such as LAWD 37, other methods for determining mass are needed.</p>
<p>McGill and his international team of colleagues were able to use a pair of telescopes&#8212;the European Space Agency&#8217;s Gaia Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope&#8212;to get the first accurate mass measurement for LAWD 37 by predicting, and then observing, an astrometric effect first predicted by Einstein.</p>
<p>In his general theory of relativity, Einstein predicted that when a massive compact object passes in front of a distant star, the light from the star would bend around the foreground object due to its gravitational field. This effect is known as gravitational microlensing. In 1919, two British astronomers&#8212;Arthur Eddington from Cambridge and Frank Dyson from the Royal Greenwich Observatory&#8212;first detected this effect during a solar eclipse, in what was the first popular confirmation of general relativity. However, Einstein was pessimistic that the effect would ever be detected for stars outside our solar system.</p>
<p>In 2017, astronomers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aal2879">detected</a> this gravitational microlensing effect for another nearby white dwarf in a binary system, Stein 2051 b, which marked the first detection of this effect for a star other than our sun. Now, the Cambridge-led team has detected the effect for LAWD 37, giving the first direct mass measurement for a single white dwarf.</p>
<p>Using ESA&#8217;s Gaia satellite, which is creating the most accurate and complete multi-dimensional map of the Milky Way, the astronomers were able to predict the movement of LAWD 37 and identify the point where it would align close enough to a background star to detect the lensing signal.</p>
<p>Using the Gaia data, the astronomers were able to point the Hubble Space Telescope in the right place at the right time to observe this phenomenon, which happened in November 2019, 100 years after the famous Eddington/Dyson experiment.</p>
<p>Since the light from the background star was so faint, the main challenge for astronomers was extracting the lensing signal from the noise. &#8220;These events are rare, and the effects are tiny,&#8221; said McGill. &#8220;For instance, the size of our measured effect is like measuring the length of a car on the moon as seen from Earth, and is 625 times smaller than the effect measured at the 1919 solar eclipse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once they had extracted the lensing signal, the researchers were able to measure the size of the astrometric deflection of the background source, which scales with the mass of the white dwarf, and obtain a gravitational mass for LAWD 37 that is 56 percent the mass of our sun. This agrees with earlier theoretical predictions of LAWD 37&#8217;s mass and corroborates current theories of how white dwarfs evolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;The precision of LAWD 37&#8217;s mass measurement allows us to test the mass-radius relationship for white dwarfs,&#8221; said McGill. &#8220;This means testing the properties of matter under the extreme conditions inside this dead star.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers say their results open the door for future event predictions with Gaia data that can be detected with space-based observatories such as JWST, the successor to Hubble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaia has really changed the game&#8212;it&#8217;s exciting to be able to use Gaia data to predict when events will happen, and then observe them happening,&#8221; said McGill. &#8220;We want to continue measuring the gravitational microlensing effect and obtain mass measurements for many more types of stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research was supported in part by NASA, the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), part of UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI), and the European Space Agency.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0f0bb111807270465ddb9afb7c84a1f1"><name>yana-garcia</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Leading and learning to save the world</title><summary>CalEPA Secretary Yana Garcia heads California’s fight against the ongoing climate crisis with her UCSC education as her foundation.</summary><start-date>1676995200000</start-date><display-name>yana-garcia</display-name><path>/2023/02/yana-garcia</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/02/yana-garcia</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1675289669888</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1677015878905</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Bayan Parrenas Shimizu</name><title></title><phone/><email>bpshimiz@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/yanagarcialead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/yanagarcialead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yanagarcialead.jpg</name><display-name>yanagarcialead.jpg</display-name><file-size>118040</file-size><width>450</width><height>619</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/yanagarciathumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/yanagarciathumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>yanagarciathumb.jpg</name><display-name>yanagarciathumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15996</file-size><width>58</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yana Garcia (Stevenson &#8217;08, politics)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC Alumna Yana Garcia heads California’s fight against the ongoing climate crisis </article-subhead><article-text><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writer&#8217;s note: Speaking with Yana Garcia, her unwavering enthusiasm for UC Santa Cruz stands out as truly unique. I&#8217;ve interviewed recent alumni and alumni from decades past, but none have dived so directly and eagerly into their time at UCSC as Garcia did within the first minute of our conversation. From the very first sentence of our interview, Garcia made clear that her education at UCSC was at the very core of her development as an environmentalist.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yana Garcia (Stevenson &#8217;08, politics) grew up amidst growing indigenous rights movements in Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico in the context of the denial of clean air and water to indigenous peoples in the area. Garcia brought a passion for these issues with her to UC Santa Cruz&#8212;fully aware of how her education could provide her with the foundation she needed to make a real impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately upon her graduation from UCSC in 2008, Garcia dove into her environmental justice career. She worked in the White Earth reservation in Minnesota before attending Northeastern University School of Law, then joined the California Environmental Protection Agency as a deputy. Garcia currently serves as a Secretary for Environmental Protection with the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA).&#160;</span></p>
<h2><strong>UCSC helps launch career in policy and environmentalism</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia&#8217;s extensive career in policy and environmentalism began in the classrooms of UCSC. As Garcia leads CalEPA in tackling the climate crisis, she credits her UCSC education in assessing the big-picture priorities of droughts, flooding, and water management, and understanding how these key issues intersect in both their causes and impacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The biggest thing that I apply now, that I gained from UCSC, is an inherently intersectional approach to everything that we do,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;We need to integrate various distinct efforts together in order to address some of our most pressing challenges and problems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia studied politics and pursued a variety of environmental studies classes at UCSC. Garcia said that her time at UCSC was defined by its diversity of classes and opportunities for learning, something she was happy to take advantage of. She added that UCSC provided her with the opportunity to immerse herself in environmental studies while also preparing for her future career in law and policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the beautiful things about UC Santa Cruz is that it allows you the flexibility to pursue a lot of different combinations of liberal arts and science curricula,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;I had a wide array of classes when I was at UC Santa Cruz, ranging from the hard environmental sciences to the politics of the military industrial complex.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even now, Garcia recalls the pedagogy of the many professors that helped her refine and develop the critical thinking and conceptual understanding that&#8217;s key to her work at CalEPA. Garcia remembers the importance of her lessons from Angela Davis, Dan Wirls, Gina Dent, and Emily Honig, who gave her a foundational education in the history of consciousness, women in law, third world feminism, and environmental sciences and issues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The class &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women in the Law&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led me to law school, and to hone in on some of those critical race theory concepts of deconstructing systems to understand the root causes of injustice,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;I've applied that to the way that I thought about policy issues in the environmental space&#8212;I credit my diverse curriculum in Santa Cruz with becoming involved in environmental justice.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before serving in her current position, Garcia was Deputy Secretary for Environmental Justice, Tribal Affairs and Border Relations at CalEPA from 2019 to 2021 and had been CalEPA&#8217;s Assistant Secretary for Environmental Justice and Tribal Affairs from 2017 to 2019.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her tenure at CalEPA, Garcia led three Environmental Justice Task Force Initiatives in the communities of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pomona</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imperial County</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stockton</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She also led the program that delivered more than $1 million in Environmental Justice Small Grants to 28 organizations to combat pollution, improve health outcomes and increase public engagement in some of California&#8217;s most pollution-burdened communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;[Yana] is a strategic and compassionate leader who played a central role in helping communities gain access to safe and affordable drinking water,&#8221; California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a </span><a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/yana-garcia-secretary-for-environmental-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Yana is known nationally as a groundbreaking environmentalist who has lifted up the voices of tribal nations, U.S.-Mexico border communities, and those struggling on the frontlines of the battle for environmental justice. I look forward to working with Yana to implement our ambitious environmental agenda with the knowledge that she is resolute in her commitment to ensuring a California for all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Secretary for Environmental Protection, Yana oversees the state&#8217;s efforts to fight climate change, protect air and water quality, regulate pesticides and toxic substances, achieve the state&#8217;s recycling and waste reduction goals, and advance environmental justice. As a member of the Governor&#8217;s cabinet, she advises the Governor on environmental policy.</span></p>
<h2><strong>We&#8217;re all in this together</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garcia holds her experience at UCSC close at heart, and hopes that its students are equally ready to make the most of their time and education. Thinking of their future, she offers a piece of guidance for UCSC&#8217;s current student body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Think about the experiential learning opportunities that are offered at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;Internships are super important. Getting direct experience and taking advantage of those opportunities while you're at UC Santa Cruz is really critical, and can help us all feel like we're contributing, rather than just sitting in a classroom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the crisis of climate change grows, Garcia calls on all students, whether in communications, art, or engineering, to contribute their knowledge and perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every perspective matters when it comes to addressing the climate crisis that we're all facing,&#8221; Garcia said. &#8220;Whether you want to work in tech manufacturing, biological sciences, healthcare, or environmental policy, or if you want to become a politician, a biologist, or an engineer&#8212;every profession, every specialty, contributes to our ability to address the climate crisis in various ways.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0f530d40807270465ddb9afb2c5a3dde"><name>elena-losada</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Pursuing social justice </title><summary>Elena Losada received the Jessica Roy Memorial Scholarship in 2022.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociology Ph.D. student Elena Losada</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was drawn to UC Santa Cruz because of its progressive culture, its strong inclination towards social justice, and she valued the space for sociology students and faculty to engage outside of the traditional discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Interdisciplinarity has really enriched my time at UCSC thus far, especially working with the Latin American and Latino Studies Department, and the Center for Integrated Spatial Research,&#8221; Losada said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losada studies processes of socio-spatial change, like urbanization and migration, and social futures in Latin America. In particular, she is interested in indigenous and agrarian lifeways in the context of majority urbanized Mexico, as well as the role of &#8216;informality&#8217; in megacities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losada was awarded the </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards/student-awards/jessica-roy/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Roy Memorial Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022. The award is intended to provide its winners with stipends to support fieldwork, travel, and research.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family, friends, and colleagues established the Jessica Roy Memorial Award in 2005 to honor the memory of UCSC graduate student Jessica Roy. The scholarship is given to graduate students within any department who have a demonstrated interest in or are pursuing studies focusing on the equitable distribution of natural resources in international development, especially as that equity applies to women.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losada used the award this past summer to carry forward preliminary ethnographic work in Mexico City and in Chiapas, looking at the exchange of indigenous ideas in the urban context. She says this trip was indispensable for designing her dissertation project which will be carried out in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating from UCSC, Losada hopes to obtain a professorship or teaching position, in the United States or in a university in Mexico.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe that the most inspiring and impactful professors and researchers are simultaneously involved in community action,&#8221; Losada said. &#8220;I hope to maintain community organizing and policy change at the center of my life work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losada&#8217;s advice to current students is to take advantage of the learning opportunities and to keep an open mind.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In my first years of the program, I was exposed to so many new ways of thinking about research and theoretical perspectives through discussions with peers, graduate seminars, teaching undergraduate students, working groups, and more,&#8221; Losada said. &#8220;I will never forget the feeling I had when I knew I had come up with a project that brought together what I had learned in graduate school and my life experiences, and also genuinely represented my political goals and hopes about the future. This feeling was a first for me in my career.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1378dc65807270460758f80a63d835c3"><name>gorenberg-worldwartwo-talk</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> Uncovering the secret war against the Nazis in the Middle East </title><summary>In his book talk on Wednesday, February 8 at UCSC, Gershom Gorenberg (Kresge '76, Religious Studies) will reveal the espionage affair that led to the British victory against Rommel at El Alamein – turning the tide of the war and preventing the mass murder of the Jews of Egypt, Palestine and the rest of the Middle East. &#13;

By 1942, Rommel was on the brink of conquering the region.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But British forces blocked Rommel&#8217;s advance in the summer of 1942 &#8211; with the secret, strategic help of&#160; brilliant Allied codebreakers.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Historian, </span><span><em>Washington Post</em> columnist </span><span>and UCSC alumnus Gershom Gorenberg, an American-born Israeli journalist, will share this previously untold aspect of World War II when he speaks about his latest book </span><em>War of Shadows </em><span>at a talk scheduled for 6 p.m., Wednesday, February 8, at the Hay Barn near the base of campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Gorenberg&#8217;s talk is this year&#8217;s </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/helen-diller-distinguished-lecture-jewish-studies/"><span>Helen Diller Distinguished Lecture</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://jewishstudies.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span>Jewish Studies</span></a><span>.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In his book talk, Gorenberg will reveal the espionage affair that led to the British victory against Rommel at El Alamein &#8211; turning the tide of the war and preventing the mass murder of the Jews of Egypt, Palestine and the rest of the Middle East.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;One human lifetime ago, the battle for the Middle East was one of the critical fronts of World War II,&#8221; Gorenberg writes in the new book. &#8220;Much of what determined the outcome of the battle, and therefore of the war as a whole, remained secret. Quickly shaped legends turned into accepted memory. Today even that misleading memory is fading. Yet what happened then shaped the Middle East, and continues to shape it today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Gorenberg&#8217;s work is the result of determined research, sleuthing and interviews,. He pored through files at the British National Archives, </span><span>and examined formerly classified papers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The fact-gathering process was so complicated that &#8220;I could write a second book&#8221; narrating what it took to put <em>War Of Shadows</em> together, Gorenberg said on Friday.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In his detailed author&#8217;s note for the book, Gorenberg wrote that </span><em>War Of Shadows</em><span> required &#8220;a journey that lasted years &#8211; to Rome, to Cairo, and the sands of El Alemein, to London and the once-secret huts of Bletchley Park, to archives in places from Tel Aviv to Palo Alto &#8230;&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He conducted lengthy interviews &#8220;(in) the homes of the children and grandchildren of people whose names have been forgotten though they changed the direction of history,&#8221; Gorenberg wrote.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Some of the papers he examined had been classified for the previous 70 years.&#160;</span><span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Gorenberg, who describes himself as &#8220;a</span><span> left-wing, skeptical Orthodox Zionist Jew,&#8221; is </span><span>also the author of </span><em>The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977</em><span>, and </span><em>The End of Days: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount</em><span>, which portrays the role of religious radicalism in the Mideast conflict.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He co-authored <em>The Jerusalem Report</em>&#8217;s 1996 biography of Yitzhak Rabin, </span><em>Shalom Friend</em><span><em>,</em> winner of the National Jewish Book Award.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A frequent guest on news programs, Gorenberg has appeared on Sixty Minutes, Nightline, Dateline, Fresh Air, and on CNN and the BBC, and is former associate editor of </span><em>The Jerusalem Report</em><span>. He has contributed to </span><em>The Atlantic Monthly</em><span>, </span><span><em>The New York Times Magazine</em>,</span><em> </em><span><em>The New Republic</em>, <em>Mother Jones </em></span><span>and</span><em> Ha&#8217;aretz.</em><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He has lectured at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Carnegie Council, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the Middle East Institute, the Wexner Graduate Fellowship, and for universities, congregations and other organizations seeking a nuanced view of politics, Mideast affairs and religion.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After graduating from UCSC, Gorenberg moved to Israel in 1977 and earned an MA in education at the Hebrew University.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He lives in Jerusalem, except when he is teaching at Columbia University. He is an active member of Kehillat Yedidya, the pioneering progressive Orthodox congregation in South Jerusalem.</span></p>

Funded by a $3.2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, the program addresses a critical need for advanced training in computational aspects of high-energy physics.</p>
<p>As physics and astrophysics experiments collect more data for high-precision measurements, researchers have come to depend on large-scale computing infrastructure and high-performance computing algorithms. Many collaborative research programs have dedicated experts in advanced computing technologies who are also experts in particle physics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Future high energy physics discoveries will require large accurate simulations and efficient collaborative software,&#8221; said Regina Rameika, associate director of science for high energy physics at DOE. &#8220;These traineeships will educate the scientists and engineers necessary to design, develop, deploy, and maintain the software and computing infrastructure essential for the future of high energy physics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new Western Advanced Training for Computational High-Energy Physics (WATCHEP) program brings together six public universities and three national laboratories to create a tailored modular curriculum and offer intensive research opportunities during a two-year training period for graduate students. The specific training areas are hardware-software co-design, collaborative software infrastructure, and high-performance software and algorithms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students from this program will become &#8216;computing ambassadors&#8217; and take their cutting-edge expertise into the large science collaborations that are dealing with enormous datasets and computational complexity,&#8221; said WATCHEP principal investigator Jason Nielsen, director of SCIPP and professor of physics at UCSC. &#8220;A unique aspect of the program is additional training in communications, project leadership, and responsible conduct.&#8221;</p>
<p>The WATCHEP institutes joining UC Santa Cruz in this program are UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, Oregon State University, University of Washington, Brookhaven National Lab, Fermilab, and Lawrence Berkeley Lab.</p>
<p>The project team has expertise in a wide range of computing topics. Some members have developed novel curricular materials for diverse graduate student cohorts in computing, others have led large computing projects for DOE science experiments, and all are currently engaged in relevant research and development projects that lend themselves to this initiative.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 10, the NEH announced $28.1 million in grants toward 204 humanities projects nationwide. Two of this year&#8217;s recipients are part of the Slug family themselves, and their new grants will help to further their research in both anthropology and musicology at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dard Neuman, Associate Professor of Music and Hasan Endowed Chair in Classical Indian Music, was awarded a Digital Humanities Advancement grant of $149,998, put toward his project, &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Platform for Digitally Transcribing and Archiving Hindustani Music.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Carla Hern&#225;ndez Garavito, Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology, received an Award for Faculty at Hispanic Serving Institutions of $45,000, put toward her project, &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reimagining Colonialism: A Local History of Community and Empire in the Peruvian Andes Between the Fifteenth and Eighteenth Centuries</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEH grants aim to fund educational resources, programs, curricula and other projects related to both teaching and learning in the humanities. For Neuman, this funding will help him to continue collaborating with his colleague, Jon Myers, a recent UCSC graduate in the Music department&#8217;s Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) program in composition as well as to support his graduate students with fully funded GSRs to advance their research.&#160; For Hern&#225;ndez Garavito, that means time to further her own research and future publications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neuman &#8212;&#160;who&#8217;s been a member of the UC Santa Cruz music faculty since 2005 &#8212;&#160;focuses on the relationship between music pedagogy and performance of Hindustani music and its relationship to the politics of creativity. Over the last few years, he developed a transcription model that tabulates numerical data and generates analyzable datasets. With the support of two Arts Research Institute (ARI) grants, Neuman has collaborated with Myers to port that system onto an interactive web interface, a project that the NEH grant helps to advance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this grant, Neuman and his team hope to advance humanistic inquiry with regards to affective communities where music or organized sound play an integral role: &#8220; By rendering the sound archive computationally analyzable, what kinds of new research questions can be asked?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Hern&#225;ndez Garavito &#8212; a Peruvian archaeologist who joined the university&#8217;s Department of Anthropology in January 2022, from Wake Forest University &#8212;&#160;the fellowship will support the completion of her first book, which investigates indigenous experiences within a continuum of colonialism through the narrative of a single Andean community (the people of Huarochiri in Peru). This book challenges traditional research on Inka and Spanish colonialism in the Andes, asking what if these empires were an addition to local history rather than the filter through which we discuss the diverse and complex communities that inhabited the Andes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s archaeological research, archival research, and a lot of spatial modeling in order to analyze how local communities of a specific region in the highlands of Lima appropriated colonialism in their own local mindsets, practices, and community-building,&#8221; she explained.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the addition of this grant, a Wenner-Gren Hunt Postdoctoral Fellowship ($40,000) and the support of her department, Hern&#225;ndez Garavito will be able to focus full time in the completion of her book through the calendar year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Neuman and Hern&#225;ndez Garavito will have the chance to celebrate their awards with the other grantees at </span><a

When it opens in 2024, the new 4,000 square foot Social Documentation Lab will provide a new, state-of-the-art, creative home for graduate students in the Department of Film and Digital Media&#8217;s SocDoc MFA and PhD programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-year SocDoc degree is the UC system&#8217;s only MFA program designed for media makers committed to exploring the expressive, connective, and disruptive potential of socially engaged documentary production. The SocDoc MFA, now in its 15th year, emphasizes ethical practices and community involvement and accountability &#8211; highlighting underserved voices and urgent issues through socially engaged documentary practices in film, audio, photography, and/or web-based and interactive platforms. Alumni have gone on to establish careers as award-winning filmmakers, producers, academics, archivists, and curators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new SocDoc Lab in the Westside Research Park will feature open areas for collaboration; a studio/gallery for immersive media and installations; a seminar room; an audio mixing room; a state-of-the-art audio recording studio; editing and work stations; and an enclosed quiet editing and color grading room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re so proud of our graduate students and alumni who have been doing groundbreaking visual and sound-based work even while lacking real lab space to develop and nurture their projects,&#8221; says Peter Limbrick, Professor and Chair of Film and Digital Media. &#8220;The Social Documentation Lab will soon offer an environment where both MFA and PhD students can continue to develop their creative commitment to social justice, using the best tools possible in an expansive space that allows for experimentation and ideas to flourish.&#8221; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, the project has been led by Professor of Film and Digital Media and Director of Graduate Studies for SocDoc Jennifer Maytorena Taylor, with the strong support of Dean of the Arts Celine Parre&#241;as Shimizu and prior Interim Dean Ted Warburton. In 2022, the SocDoc and Arts Division team completed a collaborative design and planning process with Gensler Architects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Arts Division is excited for the SocDoc Lab to be in proximity to the Environmental Art and Social Practice MFA spaces as well as Science and Engineering Labs in the Westside Research Park. This cross-disciplinary space is part of a larger university tradition of collaboration across the disciplines," says Parre&#241;as Shimizu. &#8220;This new space will provide crucial support for this important program that is composed of the most dazzling diversity, giving our current students and those that come after them opportunities that enable their rise to the highest levels of creativity and social impact.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Taylor as Faculty Director of the Social Documentation Lab, working closely with Arts Assistant Dean Stephanie Moore and UCSC staff architect Andrea Hilderman, will help lead the next phases of work in the creation and realization of the new space. The team has placed a major emphasis on universal design and access throughout the planning and design process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have developed a space plan that will allow us to make the lab accessible and welcoming for broad and diverse community engagement, while also creating a variety of work spaces and experiences for Film and Digital Media graduate students,&#8221; says Taylor. &#8220;We are building on the vision of creating a world-class facility that will serve stakeholders and partners in the Santa Cruz community as well as our diverse students and the larger field of independent documentary media makers. The SocDoc Lab will be the site for co-creation and learning not only during the academic year, but also for potential summer labs and convenings in partnership with independent documentary organizations and alliances with whom our faculty and students regularly collaborate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for this project was made possible through private donations.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="18dcb46a8072704660079c8ccd3cb03d"><name>innovation-catalyst-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Funding opportunity to develop university innovations</title><summary>The Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub is now accepting applications for its new Innovation Catalyst Grant; a proof-of-concept program focused on providing targeted gap funding, training, mentorship, and support to UC Santa Cruz researchers in order to help de-risk and/or validate the implementation and adoption potential of early-stage technology innovations. </summary><start-date>1675454400000</start-date><display-name>Innovation Catalyst Grant</display-name><path>/2023/02/innovation-catalyst-grant</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/02/innovation-catalyst-grant</link><created-by>esmith16</created-by><created-on>1675454362713</created-on><last-modified-by>esmith16</last-modified-by><last-modified>1675454891546</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub</name><title></title><phone/><email>hub@ucsc.edu </email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/02/images/research-jackets-resize.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/02/images/research-jackets-resize.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>research-jackets-resize.jpg</name><display-name>research-jackets-resize.jpg</display-name><file-size>33994</file-size><width>591</width><height>443</height></image><image-alt>Research jackets on back of chairs</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/02/images/research-jackets-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/02/images/research-jackets-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>research-jackets-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>research-jackets-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>2914</file-size><width>80</width><height>60</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Research jackets on back of chairs</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Innovation Catalyst Grants will support UC Santa Cruz researchers with early-stage technology innovations.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p dir="ltr">The<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://innovation.ucsc.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675449354640000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rBFCPlq3WTbZ3O4AOwIGS" href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub</a> is now accepting applications for its new Innovation Catalyst Grant; a&#160;proof-of-concept program focused on providing targeted gap funding, training, mentorship, and support to UC Santa Cruz researchers in order to help de-risk and/or validate the implementation and adoption potential of early-stage technology innovations.

<p><span><i>If you have COVID-19 symptoms: </i>PCR testing is available for students through the Student Health Center. To schedule a test, call the Student Health Center appointment line at 831-459-2500.</span></p>
<p><span><i>If you do not have symptoms:</i> Asymptomatic, PCR Testing is available in the Amah Mutsun conference room on the third floor of the Bay Tree building in the Quarry Plaza from 8:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday. When on-site testing is closed, visit the&#160;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/SAVELivesSantaCruzCounty/GetTested.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675552627549000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0poQmCIJdeB9Cs4s7bE4hF" href="https://www.santacruzhealth.org/HSAHome/HSADivisions/PublicHealth/CommunicableDiseaseControl/CoronavirusHome/SAVELivesSantaCruzCounty/GetTested.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>County of Santa Cruz HSA</span></a> for off-campus testing resources.</span></p>
<p><span>Rapid Antigen Tests are also available for pick up at college housing offices, the Amah Mutsun COVID testing site, Bay Tree Campus Store, as well as in the Affiliated Residential Community Housing (ARCH) offices.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Isolation protocol:</strong> If you are feeling sick please stay home and do not attend classes or work and take a COVID-19 test as soon as possible. If you test positive for COVID-19, immediately mask and self-isolate following these <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675552627549000&amp;usg=AOvVaw04QduGRwhOb_gNeQ0Av7Ld" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>COVID-19 Positive Test Result Instructions</span></a>.

<p><span><strong>Protocolo de aislamiento: </strong>Si se encuentra mal, qu&#233;dese en casa, no vaya a clase ni al trabajo y haga la prueba COVID-19 lo antes posible. Si el resultado de la prueba de COVID-19 es positivo, p&#243;ngase inmediatamente una mascarilla y autoa&#237;slese siguiendo <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675552627549000&amp;usg=AOvVaw04QduGRwhOb_gNeQ0Av7Ld" href="https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/images-pdfs/covid_positive_directions_students.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>estas instrucciones para el resultado positivo</span></a> de la prueba.

<p><span>Si obtiene un resultado negativo en la segunda prueba y le preocupa que pueda tener COVID-19, puede volver a realizar la prueba 48 horas despu&#233;s de la segunda prueba, considerar la posibilidad de someterse a una prueba molecular de laboratorio o llamar a su proveedor de atenci&#243;n sanitaria.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>COVID-19 tratamiento: </strong>Para aquellos que califican, Servicios de Salud Estudiantil (SHS) tiene medicamentos antivirales para COVID-19 que pueden disminuir sus s&#237;ntomas.

array of new programs and services designed to strengthen campus safety at the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park.</p>
<p>The improvements were the result of input from the campus community, recommendations from the Campus Safety Community Advisory Board, and ongoing implementation of the systemwide <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/community-safety-plan/">UC Community Safety Plan</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that the members of our community who live, work and study at UC Santa Cruz feel safe,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;Campus safety is not a once-and-done effort. It is a continuing conversation among our varied campus constituencies, and our efforts continue to evolve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>re-establishing the <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/saferide">Safe Ride program</a></strong>, which allows students to request a van shuttle to get around campus from 7 p.m. to just after midnight;</li>
<li><strong>launching a <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/mobile-team/index.html">Campus Mobile Crisis Team</a></strong> with staff who are trained in mental-health interventions. The team will often make first contact with those possibly in crisis;</li>
<li><strong>assigning unarmed evening security patrols</strong> at the Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park, a first step toward offering dusk-to-dawn security coverage at these locations.</li>
<li><strong>strengthening the campus&#8217;s mass-communication system</strong>, which now will send CruzAlerts for emergency notifications and SlugSafe messages for public safety updates;</li>
<li><strong>implementing a campus police customer-service reporting system</strong>, which allows community members to rate the level of service they received after interacting with an officer; and</li>
<li><strong>forming a new Police Accountability Board</strong>, which will facilitate and enhance communication between the police department and the greater campus community.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Safe Ride shuttles students around in evening</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has restored its <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/saferide">Safe Ride program</a>, a nightly van service that was stopped in 2020 shortly after the start of the pandemic. The revamped program is now managed by Transportation and Parking Services.</p>
<p>To schedule a ride, students simply need to go online, fill out a ride request, and a van will shuttle them anywhere on campus between 7 p.m. and just past midnight seven days a week when classes are in session.</p>
<h3>Campus Mobile Crisis Team responds to behavioral health crisis calls</h3>
<p>In fall, UC Santa Cruz formed a new <a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/mobile-team/index.html">Campus Mobile Crisis Team</a> with two full time intervention specialists and a program supervisor.</p>
<img alt="" class="" height="267" src="images/crisis-team-400px.jpg" style="margin: 7px; float: left;" width="400"/>
<p>The response team members are trained in mental-health interventions and will often be the first ones to make first contact with students who are possibly in crisis. The team is part of the University of California&#8217;s focus on creating a tiered response to emergency calls.</p>
<p>The team is available from Wednesday to Saturday between 2 p.m. and midnight. When it&#8217;s not available, students will have the option to speak with Counseling and Psychological Services or the UCSC Dispatch.</p>
<p>The Campus Mobile Crisis Team answered 20 calls in their first 20 days of operation, the majority resulting in incident de-escalation, outreach, or referrals for additional services without law enforcement contact.</p>
<h3>Increasing security at Coastal Science Campus, Westside Research Park</h3>
<p>Unarmed night-time security guards patrol the Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park. The campus is working toward offering permanent security coverage from dusk-to-dawn, while also increasing security by improving lighting in parking lots and installing lights at the bus stops.</p>
<h3>Strengthening emergency, public safety communications</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has enhanced its <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/campus-notification/index.html">mass communication system</a>. Supported by a service called Everbridge, the communication system now includes two kinds of notices and a mobile app that enables the campus community to receive time-sensitive push notifications.</p>
<p>CruzAlerts are sent in emergency situations in which there is possibly an imminent threat to life and safety, while Slug Safe messages are sent by email and text to keep the campus community informed about less urgent situations, such as road closures, power outages and other situations. Staff, faculty, and students are encouraged to make sure that their <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/campus-notification/index.html">contact information in the campus notification system</a> is up to date.</p>
<p>Additionally, community members, parents, and others can sign up to receive SlugSafe messages by texting SLUGSAFE to 888777.<img alt="qr-code-everbridge.png" height="91" src="images/qr-code-everbridge.png" style="float: left; margin: 7px;" width="197"/></p>
<p>The Everbridge app is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play store. Anyone with a UCSC account can sign into the app and choose which alerts to receive and how to receive updates.&#8239;For more video tutorials and feature information, visit the Campus Notifications <a href="https://oes.ucsc.edu/campus-notification/everbridge-app.html">Everbridge Mobile Application webpage</a>. &#8239; The Office of Risk &amp; Safety Services will test the campus notification system twice a year to ensure it works properly and help familiarize the campus community with how UCSC will operate in an emergency. Tests will be conducted once during the fall and once during the spring. Anyone with a registered ucsc.edu email address and mobile number will receive a test CruzAlert email and text message to their mobile device. The next test is scheduled for May 17. Another announcement will go out one week before to remind the campus community of the scheduled test.</p>
<h3>Customer-service reporting system for police interactions</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz launched a campus-police customer-service reporting system in October. After engaging with an officer, campus community members are given a card that allows them to rate the level of service they received. This can also be done online.</p>
<p>This feedback provides actionable data to reflect on the department&#8217;s services so it can continue to make improvements. By having this insight, public safety leaders will be able to enhance communications and increase efficiencies, or adjust practices that will result in better serving our UC Santa Cruz community.</p>
<h3>Forming a new Police Accountability Board</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is creating a new Police Accountability Board that will facilitate and enhance communication between the police department and the greater campus community. The board will primarily be responsible for reviewing investigation reports from police complaints and making recommendations to the Chief of Police about outcomes. The board includes staff, faculty, and students and will have its first meeting in the coming weeks. The board is still seeking graduate student and Senate faculty participants through the GSA and Committee on Committees.</p>
<h3>Transition of Parking Enforcement from UCPD to TAPS</h3>
<p>As announced in fall of 2021, Parking Enforcement has transitioned from operating under UCSC Police to Transportation and Parking Services, as of fall 2022. This transition was identified as an initial step in the campus&#8217; new approach to campus safety.</p>
<h3>Campus safety training offered monthly</h3>
<p>The Office of Emergency Management is hosting a monthly virtual campus safety training for faculty, staff, and students. The virtual training covers a variety of topics including: campus safety and security issues, emergency response procedures, department emergency action planning, mission continuity, active shooter response, campus safety resources, and an overview of the UCSC Emergency Response Framework.</p>
<p>The training is held via zoom the first Tuesday of every month, from 10&#8211;11:30 a.m. Interested persons can <a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwvd-ysqz8sG9TC8fr0ZQtw5_O1B94MrqVi">register online</a> and add the training to their calendars through the registration confirmation.</p>
<p>For any questions about the campus safety training or to make a special request to have an ad hoc training delivered to your department, please contact Amanda Gullings, Campus Emergency Manager, at <a href="mailto:algullin@ucsc.edu">algullin@ucsc.edu</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="282689fb807270465c807ce5ee1c65bb"><name>gabriel-wall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Pursuing cultural anthropology</title><summary>Gabriel Ephraim Kaplan Wall was awarded the Jeremy Demian Marx Scholarship in 2022.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When applying for colleges, UC Santa Cruz was a major standout for Gabriel Ephraim Kaplan Wall (Porter &#8217;23, anthropology and history of art and visual culture). The Oakland-based student was drawn to UCSC&#8217;s natural beauty and proximity to home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was extremely important to me that Santa Cruz is a town that I can envision myself living in and making my home,&#8221; Wall said. &#8220;I had spoken with friends from high school who were already attending UCSC who spoke very highly of the professors/courses in the humanities fields which I was interested in, as well as the school in general.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall was awarded the Jeremy Demian Marx Award for Cultural Anthropology in 2022. The endowment provides funding for an annual award for an outstanding undergraduate paper in cultural anthropology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am very interested in the overlapping of my two majors, anthropology and HAVC, in a more contemporary, pop-culture context,&#8221; Wall said. &#8220;Whether this is the world of modern music, fashion, art, or cultural practices, I enjoy thinking critically about these aspects of our modern lives through academic theories to reveal their underlying functions and significance that we are often blind to in our daily lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jeremy Demian Marx Award for Cultural Anthropology endowment was established in 1993 by Alan Marx, M.D., to honor the memory of his son, Jeremy Demian Marx, a UC Santa Cruz anthropology major who tragically died in 1992.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall says he is grateful for this scholarship and plans to save the awarded funds for a research-focused trip. He hopes to travel to New Orleans to experience its rich cultural and artistic history and the city&#8217;s profound influence on the music of the last century and is also interested in a trip to Mexico City to explore through an anthropological/cultural-historical lens.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall&#8217;s advice to other students is to take advantage of the resources offered at the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Schedule regular advising appointments, and meet with your professors one-on-one outside class,&#8221; Wall said. &#8220;It took me a long time to fully appreciate that all these people are here to help us, but it won&#8217;t happen unless we reach out. Making personal relationships with your professors, in particular, will enrich your academic experience and open many doors for you.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2853dcd3807270465c807ce5ff488945"><name>vice-chancellor-foa-reiskin</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Welcoming our new Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration </title><summary>Ed Reiskin has spent more than 20 years as a public sector administrator, most recently as the city of Oakland’s top administrative officer.</summary><start-date>1675670400000</start-date><display-name>New campus leader</display-name><path>/2023/02/vice-chancellor-foa-reiskin</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/02/vice-chancellor-foa-reiskin</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1675713830081</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1675789847893</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value><value>Weekly Keynote</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</name><title></title><phone/><email>chancellor@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/02/images/leadership-reiskin.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/02/images/leadership-reiskin.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>leadership-reiskin.jpg</name><display-name>leadership-reiskin.jpg</display-name><file-size>112484</file-size><width>1800</width><height>1200</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Ed Reiskin with his title in text</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Ed Reiskin has spent more than 20 years as a public sector administrator, most recently as the city of Oakland&#8217;s top administrative officer.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am happy to announce that Edward D. Reiskin, our new Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration, has officially joined us in Santa Cruz. His first day was Monday.</p>
<p>The scope and breadth of Ed&#8217;s experience as a public servant, his ability to successfully navigate complex environments and diverse stakeholder groups, and his competency in a host of areas over which he now has direct oversight on our campus make him a fantastic addition to our team. We published a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/12/vcfoa-announcement.html">story on Ed</a> on our campus newscenter in December.</p>
<p>Ed has spent more than 20 years as a public sector administrator, most recently as the city of Oakland&#8217;s top administrative officer. His responsibilities in that post were expansive,and included executing and enforcing all of the city&#8217;s laws and policies, administering city affairs, and overseeing an operating budget of $2.2 billion, roughly 4,500 employees, and the city&#8217;s capital program. He holds a master&#8217;s of public administration degree from Harvard University&#8217;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, a master&#8217;s of business administration from NYU&#8217;s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, and a bachelor&#8217;s of science in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>I offer my thanks to Biju Kamaleswaran, our Associate Vice Chancellor for Financial Affairs and Campus Controller, who has served as interim Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration for the past year. The work of the division is vital to our mission, and the FOA team has continued to strengthen its services and support since Biju took the reins last January.</p>
<p>I am deeply proud of the work so many on our campus are doing, prioritizing student success; elevating our excellence in research, scholarship and creative works; fostering an inclusive and welcoming climate; and improving the efficiency, effectiveness and resilience of our operations. Ed&#8217;s background in the public sector, working to make a difference in the lives of the marginalized, aligns with the mission of our campus, and I am thrilled he is joining us. Please join me in offering him a warm welcome.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2ce5656e807270467c415f8f402a62c9"><name>on-the-margins-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>SlugUnity continues with On the Margins tabling event; individual coaching sessions available for students, staff, and faculty</title><summary>In continuation of SlugUnity: a space for community healing, On the Margins will be on campus this Friday, February 10 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Quarry Plaza.

<p><span>On the Margins centers the struggles of those who lie on the margins of society. Inspired by Dr. Kimberl&#233; Chrenshaw&#8217;s article "Mapping the margins: Intersectionality, identity politics, and violence against women of color," we exist at the intersection of feminism and anti-racism to de-marginalize the margins. On the envisions&#160;a world without prisons and borders; that centers racial, gender, economic and ecological justice; that is pro Black Indigenous Womxn of Color and Trans communities; that cherishes pleasure, creative pedagogy, and imaginative exploration; and that centers community accountability and radical self-care.</span></p>
<p><span>The mission of On the Margins is&#160;to collaborate with others to design and implement anti-racist, equitable, and affirming programs, practices, initiatives, and policies. We strive to do this through love, commitment, political action, and freedom dreaming.</span><span></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2cf01d1c807270467c415f8f430ca509"><name>chief-campus-counsel-visits</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Visits set for finalists for Chief Campus Counsel</title><summary>The Chief Campus Counsel is a key leadership position at UC Santa Cruz, providing the campus with advice on a broad range of legal, regulatory and governance issues.</summary><start-date>1675756800000</start-date><display-name>Candidate visits</display-name><path>/2023/02/chief-campus-counsel-visits</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/02/chief-campus-counsel-visits</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1675791179018</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1675807488931</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The finalists for the position of Chief Campus Counsel will be on campus for one day each from Feb. 21-24.

Member institutions are invited to participate in annual meetings and other events, and can foster best practices through networking with other members.&#160;<br/><br/>Students at UC Santa Cruz can learn about and gain skills in drone operation through the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society&#8217;s (CITRIS) Initiative for Drone Education and Research (CIDER). By participating in the program, which is now hosting its second cohort of students, students get hands-on field research experience with drones and can get a FAA license with the support of the program.<br/><br/>&#8220;We are thrilled to be part of this cohort of institutions preparing our students for successful careers in the drone industry,&#8221; said Becca Fenwick, Director of CIDER. &#8220;We look forward to the continuous dialogue this program will provide on how to best serve our students and the wider community of stakeholders.&#8221;<br/><br/>The CIDER program focuses specifically on supporting and training students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM and underserved students at UCSC.

The UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://legalstudies.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Legal Studies Program,</a> in partnership with the <a href="https://www.santacruzdefenders.us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santa Cruz County Office of the Public Defender</a>, the <a href="https://www.nacdl.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a> (NACDL), and the <a href="https://www.publicdefenders.us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Association for Public Defense,</a> will host its first-ever <a href="https://www.strengthenthesixth.org/Landing/Strengthening-the-Sixth-in-Santa-Cruz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Public Defense Summit</a> on February 24-25 at the Stevenson Event Center.&#160;</p>
<p>The summit, titled <a href="https://www.strengthenthesixth.org/Landing/Strengthening-the-Sixth-in-Santa-Cruz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Strengthening the Sixth in Santa Cruz: Building Cases and Community Through Holistic Defense</a>, will feature a variety of nationally-recognized public defenders, including attorneys, social workers, and investigators, who are doing cutting-edge work in public defense, focusing on early representation, vertical representation, holistic representation, and participatory defense.&#160;</p>
<p>The summit organizers are looking forward to welcoming students, who will have the opportunity to learn about career paths in this area of law. This is especially timely given that the newest U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, is a former public defender, according to Mark Fathi Massoud, a politics professor and director of the Legal Studies Program.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time that Santa Cruz County has hosted such an event, and we are delighted to partner with the NACDL and county officials so that students benefit from attending this training for public defenders,&#8221; said Massoud.&#160;</p>
<p>The summit will kick off on the evening of Feb. 23 with <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bending-the-arc-of-justice-reimagining-the-criminal-system-tickets-525526181957?aff=ebdssbdestsearch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bending the Arc of Justice: Reimagining the Criminal System</a>, featuring author and criminal justice reform advocate Keeda J. Haynes. The event is free, but <a href="https://www.strengthenthesixth.org/Content/SC-Black-Event" rel="noopener" target="_blank">separate registration is required.</a>&#160;</p>
<p>Santa Cruz County Public Defender Heather Rogers, who is also a lecturer in the Legal Studies Program, says she is incredibly excited to include UCSC students in this training. It provides a unique opportunity for the community to come together and celebrate public defense and the defender community while gaining new skills to elevate their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of our mission to courageously defend the accused, demand equal justice for all, and empower our clients with inspired advocacy in the courtroom and community, the Santa Cruz County Office of the Public Defender is pleased to be working with national partners to bring a two-day comprehensive Holistic Defense Training to the Santa Cruz public defender community,&#8221; said Rogers.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to a Bureau of Justice Assistance Grant and the hard work of our partners at the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Association of Public Defense, we have some of the best lawyers, trainers, social workers, and investigators in the public defense world coming to Santa Cruz County to support our vision of transforming public defense to empower those we serve by honoring their experiences, amplifying their voices, and offering real solutions to the root causes of system involvement.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Yanin Monter, Legal Studies program coordinator, agrees that this is a unique experience for UCSC students interested in law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our students are always eager to learn beyond the classroom, and with many students in our program identifying as first-generation or a person of color, I think this allows them to learn directly from professionals in their fields of interest,&#8221; said Monter. &#8220;We hope that students within and outside of our program will join us, and we hope that we can continue to offer similar opportunities to our students in the years to come.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>California attorneys can earn up to 12.5 hours of Continuing Legal Education (CLE) credit for attending the two-day summit.

during a live performance may seem like a wild idea to some, but not to performance and new media professor <a href="https://theater.ucsc.edu/people/marianne-weems" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marianne Weems.</a> Weems, co-founder and artistic director of New York-based multi-dimensional theater company <a href="https://thebuildersassociation.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Builders Association</a>, is used to pushing the envelope with her ground-breaking work at the intersection of technology, media, and theater arts.&#160;</p>
<p>Weems, known for her innovative and award-winning cross-media performances and as a faculty member in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) and Performance, Play &amp; Design (PPD), is currently working on a new bi-coastal production titled Atlas Drugged, based on the ideologies of Russian American writer Ayn Rand. Rand, author of the 1943 book, &#8220;The Fountainhead,&#8221; was widely criticized for her polarizing ethical and political views after her death.</p>
<p>Weems is developing an AI-language generator with her collaborators that will be trained on Rand&#8217;s oeuvre and will produce dialogue in relation to Fox News headlines. The performance will connect and deconstruct the way Fox News discusses contemporary subjects, such as free market capitalism and the role of government, leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Weems has received funding from the Arts Research Institute's<a href="https://ari.ucsc.edu/art-and-oppression-initiative" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Art and Oppression Initiative</a> for the upcoming Rand production.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to find new technology and incorporate it in ways that deeply engage the audience in the telling of our stories using current political and social flashpoints,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Utilizing new and old theater tools allows us to flex boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weems&#8217; most recent show, <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/weems-performance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I Agree to the Terms,</a> involved actual microworkers employed by Amazon through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The crowdsourcing website allows businesses to engage gig workers to complete microtasks for pay. The performance engaged audience members by allowing them to work alongside MTurk workers using their cell phones to train the algorithm that shapes their online experiences.&#160;</p>
<p>Before joining the UCSC in 2017, Weems was head of the graduate directing program for the School of Drama at Carnegie Mellon University and then part of their arts and technology initiative called IDEATE. But Weems was attracted to the interdisciplinary nature of Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has a reputation for being innovative and cross-disciplinary, and the university allowed me to make a lab space to continue my work and engage with students,&#8221; Weems said. &#8220;My goal is to be a pipeline to New York for those interested in this unique style of theater production.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those students was <a href="https://danm.ucsc.edu/people/carl-erez" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Carl Erez</a>, a second-year MFA student in Weems&#8217; <a href="https://danm.ucsc.edu/project_group/future-stages" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Future Stages </a>experimental theater lab, who went with her last month to a workshop in New York City at the famed Juilliard School.&#160;</p>
<p>At Julliard, Weems and her students explored how to &#8220;stage&#8221; virtual reality in a live performance. They experimented with how live performers could interact with those in virtual reality vs. those who weren&#8217;t using virtual reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;The workshop was about finding ways for the audience to work directly with performers, and technology is a great way to do that,&#8221; said Erez, whose academic focus is audience participation in live performances.</p>
<p>Erez said he and his Future Stages colleagues have also recently conducted experiments in Meta&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.oculus.com/horizon-worlds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Horizon Worlds</a>, such as enacting some Fluxist performances and stretching their avatars beyond their routine use.&#160;</p>
<p>As for what&#8217;s next, Weems and her students will spend April-June 2023 conducting workshops and showings in Santa Cruz and New York City of the Rand performance and doing fundraising for the production. The show will then go into a series of rehearsals with the expectation of opening in Fall 2024.

<p><span>While January&#8217;s storms battered the California coast, I was relieved to learn that the seals at A&#241;o Nuevo Reserve, and our researchers, actually caught a break with the timing of the storms. A few weeks later would have been mid-birthing season, with many pups likely lost to the huge waves that struck the reserve. The expectant mothers that had already arrived were able to retreat inland to safety.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>Our reserves are incredible resources. A&#241;o Nuevo, Fort Ord Natural Reserve, the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve, and Younger Lagoon are all within a few minutes to a few hours from campus. A significant portion of our campus is itself a reserve, allowing students to be in an art class in the morning, then learning field-work techniques before lunch.</span></p>
<p><span>I am so grateful for the work of UCSC Natural Reserves Director Gage Dayton and his incredible team who keep the reserves up and running, giving our students access to living laboratories and creating long-term research opportunities that are simply unavailable on most other campuses.</span></p>

<p><span>My thanks to all in our campus community who completed the recent survey on </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676132393837000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hmBxtlBLNE4dT_fL_v32Q" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Leading the Change: The UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan</span></a></span><span>. More than 3,300 responded, including over half the faculty, providing valuable feedback on the work we&#8217;ve undertaken to date. The planning process is helping us develop a shared vision for the future of UC Santa Cruz, one that advances our campus goals of fostering undergraduate and graduate student success, amplifying our research impact, promoting an inclusive climate, and creating a more sustainable and resilient institution.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>We have reached a key period in the strategic planning process. Five thematic committees have been working since early fall, identifying opportunities for campus improvement and ways we can measure progress toward our goals. The survey conducted over the past few weeks provided broad feedback on those efforts. Committee members, with the help of Anna Sher of our Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies (IRAPS) unit, are now analyzing the responses to further refine our initiatives and priorities. Over the next month, the committees will also be engaging the campus community through town halls and focus groups, so look for additional opportunities to share your ideas and provide feedback. We&#8217;ll hit the next major process milestone in early spring, when the committees release draft reports detailing their proposed goals and metrics. Watch for additional calls for campus input on the proposed strategic plan later in the spring quarter.

<h3><span>Institute of the Arts and Sciences opens long-awaited gallery</span></h3>
<p><span>What a fantastic </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/01/ias-gallery.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676132393837000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hUUF0AQL_trkuWEkcFkL_" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/01/ias-gallery.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>launch of the new UC Santa Cruz Institute of the Arts and Sciences home</span></a>&#160;</span><span>this past weekend. It&#8217;s easy to see the attraction of the gallery location, near Delaware Avenue and Swift Street. The building is modern, bright and spacious. It will also serve as a wonderful connection point between our campus and the greater community.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>When many people think about our campus, it&#8217;s often our collective commitment to social justice that is top of mind. This space is a manifestation of that commitment, an example of the power of the arts to catalyze social change and serve as a vehicle to explore the critical issues of our time. Recent IAS exhibits have dealt with mass incarceration, anti-racism, climate change, and issues of borders and belonging. With state-of-the-art exhibit areas, a screening room and event space, this arts and cultural hub will encourage deep conversations around some of the greatest challenges of our day. The IAS will host nationally and internationally significant art shows &#8212; free to the public&#8212;and is poised to become a must-visit in Santa Cruz&#8217;s vibrant arts scene.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Our campus plays an important role in creating a better world, and this gallery space gives us an opportunity to show that to the general public. If you missed the opening, regular hours are noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is free to all exhibits and public programs.

<h3><span>Dr. Talithia Williams to speak at our MLK Convocation</span></h3>
<p><span>Later this month, we are holding our 39th annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Convocation, which celebrates the life and dream of Dr. King through speakers who discuss issues such as equality, freedom, justice, and opportunity through their professional contributions and personal experiences. This year we are honored to have Dr. Talithia Williams as our speaker. Williams, Associate Professor of Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College, is a big-data expert and a host of the public-television show &#8220;NOVA Wonders.&#8221; She has made it her life&#8217;s work to promote the opportunities of STEM-based education to students, parents, educators and community members. Her book, &#8220;Power in Numbers: The Rebel Women of Mathematics,&#8221; challenges stereotypes and offers powerful examples of women mathematicians&#8217; perseverance against gender and racial bias. After her talk, there will be a moderated Q&amp;A with Xavier Livermon, Associate Professor in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies. The event coincides with Black History Month, which celebrates Black excellence in all its facets. Please join me for this year&#8217;s virtual event, 6&#8211;7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 21.

<p><span>Estimada comunidad universitaria,</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Las Reservas Naturales de la UC Santa Cruz son incre&#237;bles laboratorios al aire libre y aulas vivas para la investigaci&#243;n de campo, y las oportunidades &#250;nicas que ofrecen a los estudiantes son uno de los notables beneficios de una educaci&#243;n en la UC Santa Cruz. En conjunto, miles de estudiantes de grado y postgrado de m&#250;ltiples disciplinas utilizan las reservas cada a&#241;o, aprendiendo sobre ecolog&#237;a, practicando la investigaci&#243;n de campo y obteniendo el tipo de inspiraci&#243;n que s&#243;lo puede ser inculcada a trav&#233;s de interacciones directas con los espacios naturales.</span></p>

<p><span>Mientras las tormentas de enero azotaban la costa de California, me sent&#237; aliviado al saber que las focas de la Reserva de A&#241;o Nuevo, y nuestros investigadores, en realidad tuvieron un respiro con el calendario de las tormentas. Unas semanas m&#225;s tarde habr&#237;a sido temporada de partos, con muchas cr&#237;as probablemente perdidas por las enormes olas que azotaron la reserva. Las futuras madres que ya hab&#237;an llegado pudieron retirarse tierra adentro para ponerse a salvo.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Nuestras reservas son recursos incre&#237;bles. A&#241;o Nuevo, la Reserva Natural de Fort Ord, la Reserva Landels-Hill Big Creek y la Laguna Younger se encuentran a pocos minutos o pocas horas del campus. Una parte importante de nuestro campus es en s&#237; misma una reserva, lo que permite a los estudiantes estar en una clase de arte por la ma&#241;ana y luego aprender t&#233;cnicas de trabajo de campo antes del almuerzo.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Estoy muy agradecida por el trabajo del Director de Reservas Naturales de la UCSC, Gage Dayton, y su incre&#237;ble equipo, que mantienen las reservas en funcionamiento, dando a nuestros estudiantes acceso a laboratorios vivos y creando oportunidades de investigaci&#243;n a largo plazo que simplemente no est&#225;n disponibles en la mayor&#237;a de los dem&#225;s campus.</span></p>

<h3><span>Actualizaci&#243;n sobre Leading the Change: El Plan Estrat&#233;gico de la UC Santa Cruz</span></h3>
<p><span>Mi agradecimiento a todos los miembros de nuestra comunidad universitaria que completaron la reciente encuesta sobre </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676132393837000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hmBxtlBLNE4dT_fL_v32Q" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Leading the Change: El Plan Estrat&#233;gico de la UC Santa Cruz</span></a></span><span>. M&#225;s de 3.300 personas respondieron, entre ellas m&#225;s de la mitad del profesorado, proporcionando valiosos comentarios sobre el trabajo que hemos emprendido hasta la fecha. El proceso de planificaci&#243;n nos est&#225; ayudando a desarrollar una visi&#243;n compartida para el futuro de la UC Santa Cruz, una visi&#243;n que promueva los objetivos de nuestro campus de fomentar el &#233;xito de los estudiantes de grado y postgrado, amplificar el impacto de nuestra investigaci&#243;n, promover un clima inclusivo y crear una instituci&#243;n m&#225;s sostenible y resistente.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Hemos llegado a un periodo clave en el proceso de planificaci&#243;n estrat&#233;gica. Cinco comit&#233;s tem&#225;ticos han estado trabajando desde principios de oto&#241;o, identificando oportunidades de mejora para el campus y formas de medir el progreso hacia nuestros objetivos. La encuesta realizada en las &#250;ltimas semanas ha proporcionado una amplia informaci&#243;n sobre estos esfuerzos. Los miembros de los comit&#233;s, con la ayuda de Anna Sher, de nuestra unidad de Investigaci&#243;n Institucional, Evaluaci&#243;n y Estudios Pol&#237;ticos (IRAPS), est&#225;n analizando ahora las respuestas para perfeccionar nuestras iniciativas y prioridades. Durante el pr&#243;ximo mes, los comit&#233;s tambi&#233;n involucrar&#225;n a la comunidad universitaria a trav&#233;s de asambleas p&#250;blicas y grupos focales, as&#237; que busque oportunidades adicionales para compartir sus ideas y proporcionar retroalimentaci&#243;n. El pr&#243;ximo gran hito del proceso tendr&#225; lugar a principios de primavera, cuando los comit&#233;s publiquen los borradores de sus informes con los objetivos y par&#225;metros propuestos. Est&#233; atento a las convocatorias adicionales de aportaciones del campus sobre el plan estrat&#233;gico propuesto m&#225;s adelante en el trimestre de primavera.

Es f&#225;cil ver el atractivo de la ubicaci&#243;n de la galer&#237;a, cerca de Delaware Avenue y Swift Street. El edificio es moderno, luminoso y espacioso. Adem&#225;s, servir&#225; de magn&#237;fico punto de conexi&#243;n entre nuestro campus y la comunidad en general.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Cuando mucha gente piensa en nuestro campus, suele tener muy presente nuestro compromiso colectivo con la justicia social. Este espacio es una manifestaci&#243;n de ese compromiso, un ejemplo del poder de las artes para catalizar el cambio social y servir de veh&#237;culo para explorar las cuestiones cr&#237;ticas de nuestro tiempo. Exposiciones recientes de la IAS han abordado la encarcelaci&#243;n masiva, el antirracismo, el cambio clim&#225;tico y cuestiones de fronteras y pertenencia. Con zonas de exposici&#243;n de &#250;ltima generaci&#243;n, una sala de proyecciones y un espacio para eventos, este centro art&#237;stico y cultural fomentar&#225; conversaciones profundas en torno a algunos de los mayores retos de nuestro tiempo. El IAS acoger&#225; exposiciones de arte de relevancia nacional e internacional, gratuitas para el p&#250;blico, y est&#225; llamado a convertirse en una visita obligada en la vibrante escena art&#237;stica de Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Nuestro campus desempe&#241;a un papel importante en la creaci&#243;n de un mundo mejor, y esta galer&#237;a nos brinda la oportunidad de mostrarlo al p&#250;blico en general. Si te perdiste la inauguraci&#243;n, el horario habitual es de 12 noon&#8211;5 p.m., de martes a domingo. La entrada es gratuita a todas las exposiciones y programas p&#250;blicos.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Talithia Williams is an associate professor of mathematics at Harvey Mudd College and is known for her ability to clearly explain complex numerical concepts to a general audience.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams is the author of </span><a href="https://www.talithiawilliams.com/book"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power in Numbers: The Rebel Women of Mathematics</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 30 women who broke through obstacles to follow their dreams in science, technology, engineering, and math. Her popular TED Talk, </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/talithia_williams_own_your_body_s_data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Own Your Body&#8217;s Data,"</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how high-tech self-monitoring can improve your health, has received nearly 2 million views.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s convocation is again on Zoom and will be free to the public. The MLK Convocation Committee chose to highlight three main themes in its speaker selection: Black excellence, Black joy, and Black contributions to STEM, said Anju Reejhsinghani, vice chancellor for diversity, equity, and inclusion and committee chair. &#8220;Talithia Williams jumped out as someone who could speak on all three,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her </span><a href="https://www.talithiawilliams.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Williams writes that she has made it her life&#8217;s work to "get people of all ages and backgrounds excited about the bold possibilities of a STEM education." In particular, Williams seeks to &#8220;STEMpower&#8221; women and members of underrepresented groups to enter STEM fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams grew up in Columbus, Ga., started entering math competitions in high school, and majored in math at Spelman College. She has developed statistical models that emphasize the spatial and temporal structural pattern of data. Working with the World Health Organization, she developed a model to predict the cataract surgical rate for countries in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xavier Livermon, UC Santa Cruz associate professor in critical race and ethnic studies, will moderate a question-and-answer session with Williams following her talk. David H. Anthony III, a professor emeritus of African history at UC Santa Cruz, will serve as master of ceremonies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a number of structural barriers to a STEM education remain, Reejhsinghani hopes that Williams will offer suggestions about how to increase pipelines and pathways to STEM for all who seek to enter those professions. She would like viewers of Williams&#8217;s talk to come away energized and inspired.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I hope the talk provides our audiences with a greater understanding of the various ways women and folks of color are already contributing to and leading STEM initiatives in this country," she said.</span></p>

The purpose is to provide preventative information to the campus community to aid members from becoming the victim of a similar crime.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Summary of the Crime/Incident&#160;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz police officers are investigating a rape that occurred late Friday night in the Upper Campus forest at the residential campus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The female victim and friends were at a large party in the woods. Around midnight, the friends found the woman passed out and brought her to the fire station on campus for medical attention. The woman shared with her friends that she had been sexually assaulted. Police were called to investigate.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>UC Santa Cruz is providing the woman with support and resources.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Suspect(s) Description</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The suspect is described as a young white man, approximately 5-foot, 10-inches tall with short brown hair and brown eyes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you have any information that might be helpful in this investigation, please contact Detective Paul DeOcampo at <a href="mailto:ppdeocam@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ppdeocam@ucsc.edu</a>, or, if you want, provide information through the UCPD Tip Line at 831-459-3847. Your information can be kept confidential.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Safety Tips:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Do not engage in any behavior that may be considered sexual assault.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Never use force, coercion, threats, alcohol, or other drugs to engage in sexual activity.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>No one deserves to be sexually assaulted or victimized in any way.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Take responsibility for your actions.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Remember, you need active and enthusiastic participation for affirmative consent to engage in sexual activity.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Don&#8217;t mistake submission, intoxication, or other incapacitation, or silence for affirmative consent.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Clearly communicate your intentions to your sexual partner before engaging in sexual activity.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Understand and respect personal boundaries.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>DON&#8217;T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS about consent, about someone&#8217;s sexual availability, about whether they are attracted to you, about how far you can go, or about whether they are physically and/or mentally able to consent. If there are any questions or ambiguity then you DO NOT have consent.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Don&#8217;t be a passive bystander. Intervene!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Watch out for your friends and fellow students/employees. If you see someone who looks like they could be in trouble or need help, ask if they are OK.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>NEVER put yourself in harm&#8217;s way but do something!&#160; Help can be direct or indirect.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Speak up and/or report information to law enforcement, a Campus Security Authority, or a University official when someone discusses plans to take sexual advantage of another person.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Believe someone who discloses sexual assault, abusive behavior, or experience with stalking.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Risk reduction tips can often take a victim-blaming tone, even unintentionally. With no intention to victim-blame and with recognition that only those who commit rape and/or sexual assault are responsible for those actions, these suggestions may nevertheless help you to reduce your risk of experiencing a non-consensual sexual act:</span></p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>If you have limits, make them known as early as possible.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Try to remove yourself from the physical presence of a sexual aggressor.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Find someone nearby and ask for help.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>Take care of your friends and ask that they take care of you.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>If you feel unsafe, it is okay to reach out for help by texting or calling a friend or family member</span><span>. <em><strong>In an emergency, call 9-1-1.</strong></em></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>MYTH: Victims provoke sexual assaults when they dress provocatively or act in a promiscuous manner.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>FACT: </span><span>Rape and sexual violence are crimes of violence and control that stem from a person&#8217;s determination to exercise power over another person. </span><span>Neither provocative dress nor promiscuous behaviors are invitations for unwanted sexual activity.</span><span> Forcing someone to engage in non-consensual sexual activity is sexual assault, regardless of the way that person dresses or acts. </span><span>Rape is never the victim&#8217;s/survivor&#8217;s fault.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>MYTH: It is not sexual violence if it happens after drinking or taking drugs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>FACT: Being under the influence of alcohol or drugs is not an invitation for sexual activity.</span><span> A person under the influence does not cause others to assault her/him; others choose to take advantage of the situation and sexually assault her/him because s/he is in a vulnerable position. </span><span>A person who is incapacitated due to the influence of alcohol or drugs is not able</span><span> </span><span>to consent to sexual activity</span><span>. Rape is never the victim's/survivor&#8217;s fault.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>MYTH: Most sexual assaults are committed by strangers. It is not rape if the people involved know each other.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>FACT: </span><span>Most sexual assaults and rapes are committed by someone the victim knows. A study of sexual victimization of college women showed that about 90% of victims knew the person who sexually victimized them. Most often, a boyfriend, ex-boyfriend, classmate, friend, acquaintance, or co-worker sexually victimized the person. </span><span>It is important to remember that sexual violence can occur in between people regardless of gender or gender identity. Rape is never the victim&#8217;s/survivor&#8217;s fault.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Incidents of sexual assault are taken seriously at UC Santa Cruz. If you are in the midst of any kind of emergency, immediate harm, or threat of harm, dial 9-1-1. If you have experienced sexual assault, seek immediate assistance from local law enforcement and healthcare providers. The Office of Title IX is available to provide you with written and verbal information regarding the applicable University complaint procedure for investigating and addressing your reported incident. Title IX can be reached at 831-459-2462 or via email: </span><a href="mailto:titleix@ucsc.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>titleix@ucsc.edu</span></a><span>.&#160;</span></p>

Library users benefit substantially from the work of students on Jessica&#8217;s team because they experience the world differently than almost every other generation before them.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Waggoner knows the UC Santa Cruz libraries inside and out. She first started using them when she was an undergraduate majoring in legal studies with a philosophy minor (Kresge 2003). Today, as UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s user experience librarian she&#8217;s on the other side, ensuring students and faculty can easily access resources they need to be successful in their classes, push the boundaries of research and create new knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Academic librarians play an essential role in helping community members find and access information. As resources have expanded from tactile pieces&#8212;mainly books, magazines, journals and microfiche&#8212;to digital resources, new fields have emerged in library science. &#8220;There&#8217;s always going to be key physical pieces and research that are important to house,&#8221; Waggoner explained. &#8220;But a lot of things are published only online now. So as more of the information has moved online, the role of the library has changed as well to connecting folks to that digital information and also retrieving it for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that change comes the need for new job skills. &#8220;It's an important component of librarianship now to understand digital information in terms of databases and how databases are designed,&#8221; Waggoner said. &#8220;We also need to understand information-seeking behavior. This is a key part of my job. It's not just what collections we are providing access to, but are we doing that in a way that makes sense to the people that need to use our tools and interfaces to find that information? So, to that end, a lot of my work actually involves user research.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For 15 years, Waggoner has worked at the UC Santa Cruz Library, but she almost went down another path. She majored in legal studies because she wanted to be a lawyer. That changed when Waggoner went into the professional world and worked as a paralegal. Looking back on a field study she did at the Santa Cruz County Law Library as an undergraduate, Waggoner realized what she really liked. &#8220;That was my first time working in a library,&#8221; said Waggoner. &#8220;I experienced this great mix of helping professional attorneys who would come in and need to do legal research, and also people representing themselves or filing their own claim who didn&#8217;t have experience with the law. What I really loved was helping people with their research. I just love doing research.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waggoner started working at the University Library as the government collections coordinator and then moved to emerging library technologies. She designed and developed multimedia, textual, and programmatic content for digital library systems. When she was getting her master&#8217;s in library &amp; information science at the University of British Columbia, Waggoner got her first exposure to coding, HTML, and CSS. A few years later, she enrolled in the Master of Education, Instructional Technologies program at San Francisco State University. That&#8217;s where she went deeper into coding. &#8220;&#8203;&#8203;I took courses in more advanced CSS and also got introduced to JavaScript as part of instructional technologies and designing instructional systems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, Waggoner was hired in the Digital Initiatives department as the project manager and web services librarian, one of five librarians in the department. &#8220;I found myself working with the staff creating web content to think about what the needs were of the users&#8212;the students, the staff, the faculty&#8212;coming to a webpage to do research or to learn about a library service&#8230; to make sure their pages and content really met those users&#8217; needs.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, she moved to the Learning, Research and Engagement department. Waggoner has three undergraduates working with her, two user experience assistants and a web designer assistant. Sher says library users benefit substantially from their work because students today experience the world differently than almost every other generation before them. &#8220;When they use tools like TikTok or Amazon, those are shaping their behaviors, how they engage with the digital world, their expectations and the language that's meaningful to them when they're using a user interface. User interface can no longer be a static thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, the team connects directly with students and faculty. Through interviews, they ask questions and observe how interviewees conduct searches and the words they use when discussing their online experience. &#8220;&#8203;&#8203;That helps us then come back and look at our own tools and services and design them in a way that meets the user needs. We are prioritizing our work based on what their needs are rather than what sounds exciting to me at the moment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Waggoner&#8217;s student workers are planning to go into user experience and interface work professionally. Many are cognitive science majors interested in human-computer interaction. &#8220;Their coursework really prepares them for that and then through working with me, they have additional experiences applying what they've learned in a professional environment.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assistants learn specific job-related skills and techniques, such as conducting usability studies and literature reviews, thematic analysis, user interface design, and recommendation implementation. They also gain valuable collaborative skills, including explaining their design, giving meaningful critiques and feedback, and asking questions to get the information needed to implement someone else&#8217;s vision.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over her more than two decades at the University Library, the thing Waggoner is most proud of isn&#8217;t a specific webpage or user interface she designed and implemented. &#8220;Seeing my students both engage in the research and then come up with a design that really speaks to the user needs and is much more usable than our current web content is what I'm most proud of in this work.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="51f184b9807270462f3150179d0eb709"><name>syria-turkey-support</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Supporting the people of Syria and Turkey</title><summary>On behalf of the university, Vice Chancellor Anju Reejhsinghani and Vice Provost Richard Hughey extend their deepest sympathies to all those impacted directly or indirectly by this terrible disaster. &#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are heartbroken by the devastation caused by last week&#8217;s earthquake in Syria and Turkey, which has already led to the loss of thousands of lives and a far-reaching humanitarian tragedy sure to impact many more. On behalf of the university, we extend our deepest sympathies to all those impacted directly or indirectly by this terrible disaster.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As UCSC is a global community, a number of our students, staff, faculty, and community members hail from, or have roots in, the impacted areas. Last week, Student Affairs and Success, Global Engagement, and Graduate Studies reached out directly to students from Turkey and Syria to provide support and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The severity of the earthquake and uncertainty of ongoing search and rescue operations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may understandably have heightened the concern of those with personal ties to the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone in need of further support, we encourage you to use our campus resources. All students in need of assistance can contact their student life or academic advising staff in the colleges. Support services are also available through </span><a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counseling and Psychological Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program. International students can contact </span><a href="https://isss.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Student and Scholar Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Employees can access the </span><a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee Assistance Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides personal counseling and support. We also urge faculty and supervisors to take into account the impact of this tragedy on affected students and employees.</span></p>
<p><br/><span style="font-weight: 400;">As rescue and aid workers continue their efforts, the people of Turkey and Syria are in dire need of support and aid. If you are able, please consider donating to an organization supporting rescue and relief efforts in the region, such as one from this </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/world/europe/helping-earthquake-victims-turkey-syria.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times list.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The rebuilding will take time, so please consider contributing even after the immediate relief efforts have passed. To our community members with ties to the region, we send our most heartfelt thoughts and support. And to our entire Banana Slug family, we send our gratitude for the work you do every day to build a community that is safe and welcoming to all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In community,</span></p>

And according to <a href="https://education.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=rjibrin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rekia Jibrin</a>, an assistant professor in critical studies of education within UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Education Department, engaging local communities is vital to bringing about transformative change.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I value and enjoy community-based research that responds to the historical moment, to the pulse of the people through scholarship,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Working together enables us all to do better in society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jibrin&#8217;s research focuses on how schools shape the racial order in the United States and globally. She&#8217;s also affiliated faculty in critical race and ethnic studies, and examines how anti-racist school policies and practices challenge or reproduce anti-Blackness and class oppression. Jibrin&#8217;s particularly interested in the ways people in schools negotiate and contest such circumstances while centering racial and economic justice and broader transformative change.&#160;</p>
<p>Jibrin grew up in Jos, Nigeria, under military rule. Her grandfather&#8217;s work as a gardener during British colonial rule and her father&#8217;s experience of the Biafra War largely influenced anticolonial visions of freedom that animate her scholarship. Her mother&#8217;s work as a public school teacher, teaching in Nigerian public schools with earthen floors without desks or school supplies, fed Jibrin&#8217;s questioning of what struggling for justice would take.&#160;</p>
<p>Jibrin feels that her lived experience in Nigeria and later in the United States shaped her interest in education and critical race and ethnic studies.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a highly unequal world, where resources, medications, access to water and basic electricity, climate injustice, and access to quality education fall along geopolitical lines of wealth and power, I quickly learned as a child where we were positioned in the world,&#8221; Jibrin said. &#8220;But how do children make sense of that temporary moment in time, and how can that sense-making fuel their drive to do just work? That&#8217;s what I am thinking about as we consider the value of teaching ethnic studies in schools. How can we facilitate the ways young people make sense of the contradictions that shape their lives and their roles in freedom struggles.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Amidst the reactionary racial politics of our time, Jibrin feels this sense of responsibility even more acutely as a parent now herself.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethnic studies and discerning justice will provide (my daughter) with a sense of understanding of how power and struggle in the world works, with an orientation and commitment to the world that she can use to build relationships based on love,&#8221; she said.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>One of the ways Jibrin is doing this is by working on an interdisciplinary research collaboration related to a new law. In October 2021, California became the first state in the country to require ethnic studies as a graduation requirement with the passage of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB101" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 101</a>. Each school district is responsible for implementing ethnic studies coursework.&#160;</p>
<p>In Santa Cruz County, this means supporting school teachers to source the right content for ethnic studies curriculum, preparing in-service and pre-credential ethnic studies teachers, supporting policy needs that are data-driven and centered on local knowledge, and supporting teachers in a contentious racial climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethnic studies will give kids in schools more historical understanding and depth to make sense of their life experiences to critically examine and reflect on what may seem natural in their world and doesn&#8217;t feel right,&#8221; Jibrin said. &#8220;This is about not teaching with a multicultural approach, but centering histories and radical interventions of peoples and communities that enabled us to all be more free. It&#8217;s about action and getting more activated to make just demands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jibrin and her collaborators recently received a <a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/current-fellows/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sprout Grant</a> from the Institute for Social Transformation and a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/seed-funding-grants-2022.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Seed Funding For Early Stage Initiatives Grant</a> from the Office of Research. Her collaborators include Christine Hong, associate professor of critical race and ethnic studies; Amanda Lashaw, lecturer faculty in education; Cynthia Lewis, professor of education; Daisy Martin, director of History and Civics Project; Jenny Kelly, associate professor in feminist studies and critical ethnic studies; Soleste Hilberg assistant teaching professor and director of teacher education; and Josephine H. Pham, assistant professor of critical studies of education.&#160;</p>
<p>The funding Jibrin received supports a research partnership between UCSC, Santa Cruz County&#8217;s Office of Education, and Santa Cruz County school teachers, focusing on teacher needs around ethnic studies work and identifying local knowledge that can inform ethnic studies curriculum in county school districts. The hope is that research findings will lead to insights not only locally but in the field of education and critical ethnic studies.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a deep desire to develop these partnerships within the county, with community and families, and importantly with school staff to understand how best to do this work,&#8221; Jibrin said. &#8220;We look forward to supporting the incredible work of teachers and school districts in the ways they are conceptualizing the labor of the work locally.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="56f7e64e807270466994f00b9d3473c9"><name>john-rickford</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Speaking his soul: John Rickford to speak at Distinguished Alumni Lecture</title><summary>Stevenson College Distinguished alumnus John Rickford returns to UC Santa Cruz for a reading of a chapter of his memoir, “Speaking my Soul: Race, Life, and Language.” </summary><start-date>1676484000000</start-date><display-name>john-rickford</display-name><path>/2023/02/john-rickford</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/02/john-rickford</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1676496332349</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1676496332349</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Linguistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/rickford.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/rickford.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rickford.jpg</name><display-name>rickford.jpg</display-name><file-size>92763</file-size><width>500</width><height>419</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/rickfordthiumn.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/rickfordthiumn.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rickfordthiumn.jpg</name><display-name>rickfordthiumn.jpg</display-name><file-size>18096</file-size><width>80</width><height>67</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>John Rickford graduated UC Santa Cruz in 1971 with the&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">highest academic honors from Stevenson College and designed his own major in sociolinguistics. </span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Distinguished Alumnus John Rickford returns to campus for a reading of his memoir</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC distinguished alumnus will return to Stevenson College on Feb. 28 for a distinguished alumni lecture, where he will read the ninth chapter of his memoir, &#8220;University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), and the summer of 1969.&#8221; The event will take place at the Stevenson College Library at 3:30 p.m and will be followed by a reception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope people will see the important role that UC Santa Cruz played in my life,&#8221; Rickford said. &#8220;It made a major impact on my life. The courses I took and the people I met, both the students and faculty, had a profound influence.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rickford said he wants to share his story and is excited to do so at his alma mater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stevenson College was a wonderful place for me, and I really loved it at UCSC,&#8221; Rickford said in a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2008/10/2519.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;UCSC gave me the freedom to design my own major and the opportunity to learn how to use linguistics to solve real problems in education.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Attending the University of California, Santa Cruz</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC was not on my university dream list&#8221;&#8212;the ninth chapter of Rickford&#8217;s memoir starts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young scholar in Guyana, Rickford had his eyes set on UC Berkeley. He was encouraged to pursue UCSC&#8212;a newfound institution with a small student population&#8212;since it would be a similar size to what he was used to in the small South American country of Guyana. Upon his first year at UCSC, Rickford quickly decided that it was the school for him and stayed until he graduated in 1971.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rickford arrived at the newly opened UC Santa Cruz campus in 1968 on a Fulbright undergraduate scholarship. By the time he graduated, Rickford had earned highest academic honors from Stevenson College and designed his own major in sociolinguistics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rickford says he was grateful for the small class sizes, impactful professors like Roger Keesing and J. Herman Blake, and his involvement as President of the Black Student Alliance. Classes taught by Keesing and Blake and activist movements spearheaded by the BSA led Rickford to grapple with his racial identity as a Black man in America.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Guyana, I was considered mixed race, but in America, theoretically, even a drop of blood would make you a Black person,&#8221; Rickford said. (He is actually 34% African and 13% East Indian, as later DNA data show.) &#8220;When I attended UC Santa Cruz, there was only Stevenson, Cowell, Crown, and Merrill Colleges, so there weren&#8217;t many Black students (about 25) on campus. In that smaller environment, I began to explore the Black community and consider myself a part of it for the first time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon graduating from UCSC, Rickford earned his Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania and has been on the faculty at Stanford since 1980.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rickford has spent more than 50 years studying varieties of English spoken by African American and Caribbean Creole speakers&#8212;examining how they are structured, how they evolve, and what impact they have in classrooms and courts that discriminate against, deny or disparage them.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is author or editor of more than 15 books, and his publications have been recognized by an American Book Award, a Language and the Public Award, and the Best Paper in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Award, among other honors. He served as President of the Linguistic Society of America in 2015.and was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017, and to the National Academy of Sciences and the British Academy in 2022.&#160;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attending UC Santa Cruz changed Christy Martin&#8217;s life in every way possible.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin (Rachel Carson &#8217;88, computer and information science) was a first-generation college student and a sophomore transfer. She was grateful to have access to professors who kept her motivated and served as early role models for women in STEM. Martin also met her partner of 35 years, Cindy, in the Kerr Hall lab, and Santa Cruz has been her home ever since.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC changed my life in many ways,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;My parents taught me to be an independent thinker, and going to a school that encouraged you to figure out who you were while you were in this creative, safe place made it a lot easier to launch my career and have the confidence to start my own technology services company.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin joined the UCSC Alumni Council in 2019 to reconnect with the UCSC and Santa Cruz community. She currently serves as the Vice President of Finance and says it is rewarding to help the university and its students. Martin enjoys learning more about the university&#8217;s different academic divisions and current student experiences and working with a diverse group of alumni councilors ranging from pioneer classes to recent graduates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was the architect for a system used by the Genomics Institute a few years ago, and I was so impressed by their research,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;It reminded me how much I missed being on campus. UCSC is a powerful network, and it&#8217;s always easy and fun to talk with other alumni. So I felt like joining the Alumni Council was a great way to get better connected into that community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni Councilors are volunteer leaders who collaborate with UCSC staff to connect with and engage over 140,000 alumni, support student success, advocate for UCSC, fundraise to support campus initiatives, and ensure the alumni voice as part of UCSC&#8217;s culture and future. The Council manages endowments that sponsor student scholarships, college experiential learning programs, and provide support for student projects.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://alumni.ucsc.edu/about/council/seeking-councilors.html"><strong>UCSC Alumni Council</strong></a><strong> applications and recommendations are now open through March 10. Candidates will undergo an interview process, and the 2024 cohort will be selected to begin a two-year term on July 1.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would definitely recommend joining the Alumni Council,&#8221; Martin said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great way to build skills and make new friends while you are supporting students and fellow alums via the Alumni Association programs and scholarship funds. There&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s offered.&#8221;</span></p>

a short fictional film and accompanying website about people of Japanese ancestry remaking their lives in the Midwest following their wrongful incarceration during World War II. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-sponsored by the Watsonville-Santa Cruz Japanese American Citizens League, Marcia Hashimoto will speak on the legacy of her late and much beloved husband, educator and civil rights advocate </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/mas_hashimoto_racism_and_america_s_concentration_camps/transcript?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mas Hashimoto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.The event will serve as a Day of Remembrance to reflect on the impact of the signing of Executive Order 9066 in 1942, which authorized the US military to imprison persons of Japanese ancestry in incarceration camps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watsonville&#8217;s Taiko Japanese drumming group will perform, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the screening will be followed by remarks from the project's executive producer, Jason Matsumoto as well as UCSC Dean of Humanities Jasmine Alinder, who served as the project&#8217;s lead academic advisor and member of the education team. Through books, articles, exhibitions, and digital humanities projects, Dean Alinder has focused much of her research on the Japanese American experience during World War II. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that made this project really special was the dedication and passion of its creators,&#8221; Alinder says. &#8220;Each element of the website, each word in the script, and every piece of material was repeatedly poured over, discussed, and modified to fit our collective vision of what the project could accomplish as an accessible and equitable educational resource.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A panel conversation with those involved with the project, moderated by Dean of Arts Celine Parre&#241;as&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shimuzu, and a reception will follow &#8212; all free and open to the public.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Night at the Museum, the Humanities Institute has worked &#8220;with different scholars over the years on topics resonating with our community members,&#8221; THI Managing Director Irena Poli&#263; explains. &#8220;Our mission is to engage with a broad audience, and to have our community members and scholars together discussing questions that matter to all of us,&#8221; Poli&#263; says. &#8220;We encourage all to come to the program, see the current exhibits and connect with one another.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free admission extends to the whole museum, including the multimedia exhibit &#8220;Bay of Life,&#8221; which The Humanities Institute also supported. Created by photographer Frans Lanting and writer, editor, and videographer Chris Eckstrom, &#8220;Bay of Life&#8221; centers on &#8220;a remarkable recovery which shows that damaged ecosystems can be restored when people care and take action together,&#8221; per MAH&#8217;s website. For over three decades, Lanting and Eckstrom have &#8220;documented the crown jewels of our planet&#8217;s natural heritage for National Geographic &#8230; and they consider Monterey Bay to be one of them,&#8221; according to the </span><a href="https://bayoflife.net/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Night at the Museum is steeped in this spirit of collaboration and the bridging of community and scholarship. As MAH&#8217;s Executive Director Robb Woulfe emphasizes, &#8220;Over the years, we have co-hosted exhibitions and public programs, and The Humanities Institute&#8217;s undergraduate and graduate students have worked with us on various interdisciplinary projects and publications.&#8221; Woulfe recalls past collaborations as highly successful at bringing together scholars, artists, and community members together he says, and looks forward to the MAH partnering once again with The Humanities Institute and the Humanities Division on this year&#8217;s UCSC Night at the Museum. &#8220;From revolutions, to local histories, to imagining the future of our world. The work of The Humanities Institute and the Humanities Division at UC Santa Cruz aligns perfectly with the MAH's mission.&#8221;</span></p>

The game&#8217;s new &#8220;OpenASO: RNA Rescue&#8221; challenge will tap into the collective intelligence of Eterna&#8217;s 250,000 registered users to help design an RNA drug for the treatment of hemophilia A.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Eterna player community may be able to come up with designs that we wouldn&#8217;t get using traditional screening methodologies for drug development,&#8221; said Michael Stone, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Eterna is an open science platform that has been engaging citizen scientists in RNA-related puzzles for over 10 years. Previous challenges have included OpenVaccine, to design a more stable mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, and OpenTB, to develop a new diagnostic device to detect tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Stone and his colleagues at UCSC&#8212;including molecular biologist Jeremy Sanford and geneticist Olena Vaske, both faculty in the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology&#8212;have been working to develop therapies for diseases caused by genetic mutations that disrupt the processing of RNA in the cell. One approach that has shown promise in treating this type of disease is called antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy.</p>
<p>In all cells, RNA molecules copy information from DNA and direct the synthesis of proteins. ASOs are short segments of RNA designed to bind to specific cellular RNA molecules. They can modify gene expression or RNA processing and, in some cases, correct defects caused by genetic mutations. But developing an ASO that has the desired effect typically requires &#8220;brute force&#8221; screening efforts that can take many years to yield positive results.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the goals of our project is to accelerate that discovery process,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;That&#8217;s where Eterna comes in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rhiju Das, who leads Eterna and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Stanford University School of Medicine, said Eterna players have come up with RNA design solutions that out-performed the results of supercomputers and expert research teams.</p>
<p>When Stone told Das about his team&#8217;s work on developing an RNA-based therapy for hemophilia A, Das said he thought the Eterna community might be able to help.</p>
<p>&#8220;The community of Eterna players has discovered unusual principles for designing new kinds of RNA diagnostics and stabilizing mRNA vaccines, resulting in dozens of scientific papers. It will be exciting to see what they can now do in ASO therapeutics with experimental feedback from experts at UCSC,&#8221; Das said.</p>
<p>Hemophilia A is caused by mutations in the gene for the blood clotting factor 8 (F8), a protein required for the normal clotting of blood to control bleeding. When a protein-coding gene like F8 is activated, its DNA code is copied into RNA molecules called messenger RNAs. Before these messenger RNAs can direct protein synthesis, however, they undergo a modification process called RNA splicing that involves removing certain sections of the sequence. This RNA splicing process can be derailed by genetic mutations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out that many genetic diseases involve splicing defects,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;Jeremy Sanford&#8217;s research team has identified hemophilia-causing mutations in the factor 8 gene that lead to RNA-splicing defects, and we want to target this &#8216;toxic RNA&#8217; with ASOs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the OpenASO: RNA Rescue challenge, Eterna players are tasked with designing an RNA oligonucleotide that can bind to the F8 messenger RNA in a way that will correct the splicing defect. &#8220;Our idea is to design an oligonucleotide to disrupt a certain tract of the RNA that modulates splicing,&#8221; Stone explained. &#8220;But as players start to dig in, they&#8217;ll come up with solutions based on their own criteria, which may have nothing to do with biology but which might actually work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winning solutions are determined by the votes of the player community. The UCSC researchers will then synthesize the top candidates and test them in laboratory experiments, reporting the results back to the players.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all very excited to see how this goes,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;There is a long list of mutations that appear to cause RNA splicing defects and a lot of interest in exploring the potential for ASO therapies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UCSC team&#8217;s preliminary work on Factor 8 mutations was funded by a seed grant from the UCSC Office of Research. In addition, critical contributions to the investigation of RNA splicing defects in F8 were made by undergraduates in Sanford&#8217;s lab, funded by a National Science Foundation grant to support <a

<p>The Scientific Teaching through Astronomy Research (STARs) programs funded by the grant will increase the number and diversity of students who are able to take part in astronomy activities, both at the observatory on Mt. Hamilton and in local Bay Area communities. The aim is to provide inspiring and transformative experiences to a diverse population of students at different stages in the &#8220;STEM pipeline&#8221; leading to careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
<p>UCO Director Bruce Macintosh said STARs will establish partnerships with Bay Area community colleges and California State University (CSU) campuses to enable their students to use the powerful telescopes at Lick Observatory for educational and research activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to broaden access to this kind of science, giving more students opportunities to use real science-grade equipment and learn research skills in ways that will help them through the STEM pipeline, whether they want to follow astronomy or some other path,&#8221; Macintosh said.</p>
<p>Other STARs programs will &#8220;bring the mountain to the students,&#8221; he said, through outreach activities in Bay Area communities featuring portable telescopes, visiting astronomers, and engaging activities. These programs would reach students at younger ages through activities at K-12 schools and community libraries.</p>
<p>&#8220;In almost every astronomer&#8217;s backstory there is a moment at a telescope when they see something they saw in a book before, and now they realize it&#8217;s real and it&#8217;s something they can study for themselves,&#8221; Macintosh said. &#8220;Our goal is to bring that experience to as many people as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Implementing these programs will require the observatory to hire dedicated staff for education and outreach and refurbish some of the historic infrastructure at Lick Observatory. Some of the dormitory facilities, for example, need to be restored and modernized to accommodate more visitors staying overnight on the mountain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lick Observatory is an amazing place, but it&#8217;s more than 130 years old,&#8221; Macintosh said. &#8220;If we&#8217;re going to do these programs, we&#8217;ll need places for students to sleep, so restoring and modernizing the aging infrastructure is an important part of this effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory remains an active research facility at the forefront of astronomy, with modern telescopes and innovative cameras and instruments developed and used by UC astronomers. Its location just east of San Jose makes it accessible to a large and diverse population, and the beautiful historic site contributes to the observatory&#8217;s power to inspire and inform students and the public. Lick currently hosts a range of visitor opportunities and activities during its <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/">Summer Series</a> program, including night-time lectures, concerts, and telescope viewings.</p>
<p>STARs will build on the successes of existing astronomy education programs developed by faculty at UC Santa Cruz and will work in collaboration with them. These include La Noche de las Estrellas, a popular Spanish-language program at Lick Observatory for high school students and their families, and Lamat, a highly successful mentoring program for students from community colleges.</p>
<p>UCO&#8217;s <a href="https://isee.ucsc.edu/">Institute for Scientist and Engineer Educators (ISEE)</a>, which received a presidential award for excellence in STEM mentoring, will provide training for the teachers, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars participating in the STARs programs, in addition to providing expertise in curriculum development and assessment. ISEE Director Lisa Hunter and her team will lead STARs in the short term as the observatory spins up the new programs and begins hiring permanent staff.</p>
<p>Planning for the new programs has been a long-term effort, and Macintosh acknowledged the contributions of previous UCO directors, including Michael Bolte, Sandra Faber, Claire Max, and Constance Rockosi.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came into this job with an interest in broadening access to science, and to have a grant like this come through right off the bat is pretty awesome,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are deeply grateful to the Moore Foundation for their steadfast commitment to science and astronomy.&#8221;</p>

As career led her to becoming a genomicist, she has focused this passion into a commitment to equity in scientific research, particularly in advancing genomic data sharing and management and responsible research practices.&#160;<br/><br/>Now, that commitment has been recognized as she received the National Human Genome Research Institute&#8217;s (NHGRI) inaugural Staff Award for DEIA Innovation in the Genomics Workforce.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;The notion of reconstructing and reorienting the scientific enterprise toward a more just, equitable, and inclusive future can be uncomfortable and daunting, but it&#8217;s also exciting,&#8221; Mc Cartney said. &#8220;I am thrilled that I have the opportunity to play a very small part in reimagining and creating this future for genomics research &#8211; one where all views are voiced and recognized as co-equal, and where diverse perspectives are viewed as a resource and not an obstacle.&#8221;<br/><br/>Mc Cartney studied at Dublin City University in Ireland, participated in the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship Programme to get her Ph.D., and worked as a postdoctoral scholar in Aotearoa, New Zealand, where she created bioinformatics pipelines to make reference genomes for endemic and endangered species. She was inspired by the need to create genomics tools that respected M&#257;ori practices, protocols, and knowledge systems. She left this experience motivated to address the challenge of operationalizing Indigenous data governance practices in existing data infrastructures.<br/><br/>When Mc Cartney joined the NHGRI&#8217;s Genome Informatics section as a visiting fellow, she seized the opportunity to apply what she learned during her time in Aotearoa to other ongoing projects, where similar issues could be found for other communities underrepresented in science. As the director of the European Reference Genome Atlas pilot project, she was tasked with building an entire distributed genomics infrastructure that could scale to include researchers across Europe. She focused on developing equitable data sharing policies within this context, which led her to be recognized as a leader in this space.&#160;<br/><br/>She was then elected co-chair of the <a href="https://www.earthbiogenome.org/">Earth BioGenome Project&#8217;s</a> Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) Committee, where she developed policy and hosted conference workshops to support researchers globally to embed the JEDI principles across the full scope of Earth BioGenome partner projects. She led an Indigenous data sovereignty working group to ensure that Indigenous voices were recognized and heard in the data sharing and management policy.&#160;<br/><br/>Mc Cartney is also a co-organizer of IndigiData, an annual workshop focused on introducing undergraduate and graduate students to centering Indigenous cultures and data sovereignty in genomics data science research.&#160;<br/><br/>Now at UCSC, she is still working the European Reference Genome Atlas and Earth BioGenome Project, while also a scientist with Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Karen Miga&#8217;s group, collaborating on both the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium (T2T) and Human Pangenome Research Consortium (HRPC) projects. She continues to be focused on the fair management of data in genomics through her various projects.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="755bc1e7807270462d259573d207280a"><name>overleaf-subscription-tn</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Overleaf Pro is now free for campus community</title><summary>Thanks to the combined efforts of the Office of Research, the School of Engineering, and the Division of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, Overleaf Pro is now available to everyone on campus, including students, at no cost through December 21, 2023. </summary><start-date>1676966400000</start-date><path>/2023/02/overleaf-subscription-tn</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/02/overleaf-subscription-tn</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1677006193106</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1677006223377</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span>Thanks to the combined efforts of the Office of Research, the School of Engineering, and the Division of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, Overleaf Pro is now available to everyone on campus, including students, at no cost through December 21, 2023.&#160;<br/><br/></span><span></span></div>

The key policy revisions includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responding to feedback from the previous systemwide review.&#160;</strong>During the 2021 systemwide review of BUS-43, multiple commenters noted that BUS-43 was difficult to understand, and the language didn&#8217;t match best practices for Presidential Policies. As a result, BUS-43 has been rewritten using plain language where possible.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Addresses inconsistencies and formatting errors. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The last full review of BUS-43 was in 2012, and over time subsequent revisions introduced formatting errors such as incorrectly numbered sections and inconsistent styles within each section. This revision corrects those errors and applies a consistent style throughout the policy. This revision also updates BUS-43 to match current Presidential Policy guidelines.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Clarifies what policy does and does not allow. <span style="font-weight: 400;">BUS-43 currently uses &#8220;should&#8221; and &#8220;should not&#8221; in policy requirements. This has caused confusion in determining what are policy requirements vs what is recommended or allowable. The BUS-43 revision clarifies what are policy requirements (&#8220;must&#8221; or &#8220;must not&#8221; do), what is or isn&#8217;t allowed (&#8220;may&#8221; or &#8220;may not&#8221; do), and what is recommended as best practice for procurement at the University of California.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: The revision does not change the intent or requirements of BUS-43. The new language is designed to help faculty, students, and staff understand what the policy requirements are.&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Separates policy from procedure. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">BUS-43 currently contains both policy and procedures for Procurement. The procedures are not required policy, and therefore don&#8217;t belong as part of BUS-43. The BUS-43 revision contains just the policy and required procedures. The remaining procedures will be moved to the Systemwide Procurement portal as guidelines for faculty, students, and staff who participate in the procurement process at the University of California.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft policy is available for </span><a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/policies/policiesinreview/bus-43_2023.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">viewing online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams, a big data expert who has hosted PBS programs &#8220;Nova Wonders&#8221; and &#8220;Zero to Infinity,&#8221; shared her own career journey as an African-American mathematician from self-described average student to college professor. She said her life goal is to encourage more women and people of color to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. &#8220;You have a right to take up space in STEM,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Really believe it and act accordingly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said she never thought about herself as a potential mathematician until her high school teacher, &#8220;an old white guy&#8221; in Georgia, told her she was talented in math and should consider majoring in it in college.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took his advice and studied math at Spelman College, a historically black college for women in Atlanta, where she met her first black female scientist. &#8220;She was a visual example of what I could one day become,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, she enrolled in a graduate program in biostatistics at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, D.C. She then transferred to a doctoral program at Rice University in Houston, which was her first experience not at a historically black college. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things were different. At a math conference, she was asked if she was at the right place. &#8220;I had these slight microaggressions at different moments that made me wonder if this was where I should be.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she did earn her PhD and went on to work at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena and the National Security Agency. She wrote the book </span><a href="https://www.talithiawilliams.com/book"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power in Numbers: The Rebel Women of Mathematics</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 30 women who broke through obstacles to follow their dreams in STEM and gave a popular TED Talk, </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/talithia_williams_own_your_body_s_data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Own Your Body&#8217;s Data,&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how high-tech self monitoring can improve your health.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who want to follow in her footsteps should find joy in the struggle by getting support from friends, family and other communities. She has a husband and three children, and said having a family has always been very important to her.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said it&#8217;s important for everyone to discover themselves in the process as they pursue their STEM studies. For instance, discovered that she really loved making math enjoyable and understandable to those who find it difficult. That love led her to host the PBS shows. She didn&#8217;t have a 5- or 10-year plan to be on a TV show; it just unfolded as she followed her passion day by day. Williams also cited the example of Kizzmekia Corbett, an African-American immunologist who helped with the development of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. Williams said she probably never guessed she would be part of such a historic project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Williams said it&#8217;s important for women and people of color to lead with passion and purpose. For her, this has meant organizing conferences for girls to meet women scientists and participating in mentorship opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams shared how her long interest in data, health and society evolved with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. She was impressed with how Johns Hopkins shared its data on the virus putting out more information in the hands of the public than ever before. People began posting photos of themselves getting the shot on social media. &#8220;All of the sudden with Covid-19 we were sharing our very personal health data,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was surprised when her mother was reluctant to get the shots. Her mother said remember what happened with the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuskegee Study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 40-year experiment in Alabama to study untreated syphilis in black men. The men were recruited without their consent and were offered free food and medicine to participate but were not offered penicillin as treatment. This went on from 1932 to 1972 when an Associated Press story exposed the experiment. Decades later, President Bill Clinton formally </span><a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/classroom-resources/texts/bill-clinton-apologizes-for-tuskegee-experiment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apologized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said many people besides her mother remember that dark time and their perspectives should be taken seriously. Experts should listen to lived experiences and consider that as data as well. &#8220;We would do ourselves a service by valuing that data and making it part of our decision making,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said anyone who has a passion for STEM should keep pursuing that field even if it is difficult and they don&#8217;t do well on a difficult course or test. She reminded students they can always try again and they shouldn&#8217;t give up on the first try.&#160; There is always a way to move forward. &#8220;Make sure you take time to discover that thing that brings you passion and joy,&#8221; she said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8024ecfa8072704639b2afdeacd2eaf5"><name>tci-deepreads-feature-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Introducing The Humanities Institute’s 2023 Deep Read: Elizabeth Kolbert’s Under A White Sky: The Nature Of the Future</title><summary>This year's Deep Read selection is Under A White Sky: The Nature Of The Future by New Yorker staff writer and Pulitzer Prize winner Elizabeth Kolbert.

<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;We're looking forward to engaging with Deep Read participants around the climate change issues that Kolbert details with such nuance and urgency in her book, learning about how our community is involved in efforts to mitigate the climate crisis and discussing the crucial role that the humanities play in communicating the gravity of the crisis,&#8221; said Laura Martin, who teaches the Deep Read course at Porter College and is the THI project manager for the Deep Read program,</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has been an important voice for conservation and environmental protection since it opened in 1965,&#8221; Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder said. &#8220;These Deep Read events will enhance and deepen our understanding of the climate crisis, as well as the potentials, complications, and consequences of countermeasures.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;This a great opportunity to talk about how humanistic modes of inquiry contribute to this conversation,&#8221; Alinder added. &#8220;Science is an important part of the solution, but the humanities can help us center issues of justice and take into consideration how history, culture, and behavior influence our perspectives and actions..&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Those humanistic modes of inquiry also play an integral role in understanding and confronting the consequences of actions taken in response to environmental and climate-related problems,&#160; an issue that Kolbert&#8217;s book addresses in detail, Alinder said.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Under A White Sky</em><span> &#8220;expertly mixes travelog, science reporting, and explanatory journalism, all with the authority of a writer confident enough to acknowledge ambiguity,&#8221; says Carlos Lozada in the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/11/kolbert-white-sky/"><span>Washington Post</span><span>.</span></a><span>&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;</span><span>Kolbert is peerless in her ability to convey hard truths about the impact of human activity on the environment with a sense of humor that encourages us to be hopeful that we can learn from our mistakes, that all is not lost" said professor of literature Sean Keilen, who co-founded </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/deepread/"><span>The Deep Read program </span></a><span>with Irena </span><span>Poli&#263;, managing director of The Humanities Institute at UCSC.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Kolbert&#8217;s book delves deeply into the damage that people have done to the earth, and the great lengths that concerned scientists have taken to mitigate some of that damage, from building &#8216;electric fish barriers&#8217; to recreating entire environments in laboratory settings.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But the book also examines the chilling complications and unintended consequences of humans using their talents, ingenuity, and resources to reverse or at least slow down some of the tremendous damage homo sapiens has inflicted on the environment.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><em>Under A White Sky&#8217;</em>s </span><span>opening chapters show what happened when biologists, a year after the publication of Rachel Carson&#8217;s </span><em>Silent Spring </em><span>in 1962, started using exotic carp in place of pesticides to counter the growth of aquatic plants that choked waterways. It didn&#8217;t take long for the resilient, adaptable carp to become a far bigger problem than the plants, gobbling native species, reproducing at astounding rates, and expanding their territories.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To engage with this book, members of the UC Santa Cruz community will delve deeply into </span><em>Under A White Sky</em><span> while considering </span><span>the stark changes taking place in the world and explore the efforts to adapt and survive in this era of climate change.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Readers will look at how a humanistic approach to the subject of climate change can help humans navigate this difficult reality and live ethically in a period of ongoing climate crisis.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Deep Read activities will include regular weekly emails that will unpack different aspects of the book with the guidance of visiting associate professor of journalism Jody Biehl, professor of environmental studies Sikina Jinnah, professor of marine sciences Mike Beck, who directs the new Center For Coastal Climate Resilience, and assistant professor of environmental art Jorgge Menna Barreto.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There will be online forums to ask questions and connect with fellow Deep Readers, and a salon in which participating professors will lead a discussion with UCSC students and other members of the Deep Read community joining either virtually or in person.&#160;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Deep Read Program is made possible through the generous support of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I continue to be impressed with the quality of the applicant pool and the broad diversity represented. The students make our job very difficult as we work very closely with our faculty to determine who will be offered admission. The resilience and perseverance demonstrated by both students applying from high school and those transferring from another college is so commendable," said Associate Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management Michelle Whittingham. "We also recognize and appreciate all the support provided by family, teachers and counselors who guided them as they navigated a very different educational journey."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz continues to attract a highly accomplished and diverse applicant pool, composed of scholars who are ready to make the world a better place.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Increase in California first-year applicants </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competition to earn a spot at UC Santa Cruz remains strong this year, with a record number of applications received. The campus is continuing to carefully manage its total enrollment while </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/11/kresge-housing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional student housing is built</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New students are eligible for a one-year housing guarantee if they indicate a preference for university housing when accepting their offer of admission and meet all housing application deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus received more than 79,900 applications from first-year students and transfer students combined, a 3.1 percent increase over the previous year, according to </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-announces-application-totals-fall-2023-admission"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary data released today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the UC Office of the President.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus received more than 54,000 applications from California high school students, a 3.3 percent increase over the previous year, and more than 10,100 applications from California students studying primarily at California community colleges, a 3.3 percent decrease, which is reflective of the enrollment changes in the community colleges and in line with trends across the UC system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz received more than 23,500 applications from California students with families with low incomes, and more than 19,000 from California first-generation students. Total applications from international students and U.S.residents from outside California increased by 7 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of California first-year applicants, 5 percent identify as African American; 34 percent as Asian American; 33 percent as Chicanx/Latinx; 1 percent as American Indian and 23 percent as white. Of the California community college applicants who are domestic students, 6 percent identify as African American; 28 percent as Asian American; 31 percent as Chicanx/Latinx; 1 percent as American Indian; and 31 percent as white.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is continuing to build on a string of achievements and honors that are creating transformative change.

<p>Unfortunately, spawning Chinook salmon are increasingly younger and concentrated within fewer age groups, with the oldest age classes of spawners rarely seen in recent years. The new study, <a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjfas-2022-0171">published February 27 in the <em>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</em></a>, suggests changes in hatchery practices and fishery management could help restore the age structure of the salmon population and make it more resilient to climate change.</p>
<p>The researchers focused on Sacramento River fall-run Chinook salmon, which contribute heavily to the salmon fisheries of California and southern Oregon. This population is particularly susceptible to the effects of increasingly severe drought conditions driven by climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we get more variable climate conditions, with greater extremes of rainfall and drought, we are going to see more &#8216;boom-and-bust&#8217; population dynamics unless we start to restore the age structure of the population, which can spread out the effects of good and bad years across time,&#8221; said senior author Eric Palkovacs, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Fisheries Collaborative Program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>If most of the salmon return to spawn at the same age, one bad year could be devastating for the overall population. Spreading the risk over multiple years is an example of what ecologists call the &#8220;portfolio effect,&#8221; like a financial portfolio that spreads risk over multiple investments.</p>
<p>First author Paul Carvalho, a postdoctoral fellow with the Fisheries Collaborative Program, explained that juvenile salmon are especially vulnerable to the effects of drought as they migrate to the ocean from freshwater rivers and streams.</p>
<p>&#8220;We focused on the impacts of drought on the survival of juvenile salmon, but drought conditions can also increase mortality of returning adult salmon as they migrate upstream to spawn,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carvalho developed a life cycle model of the Sacramento River fall-run Chinook salmon population to simulate the effects of different drought scenarios and other variables on the population. The model was grounded in data from field studies, such as research by NOAA Fisheries scientists that quantified the relationship between river flows and survival rates of juvenile salmon.</p>
<p>The model allowed the researchers to assess the effects of different mechanisms that can affect the age structure of the population. A century ago, most of the spawning salmon returning to the Sacramento River watershed were four years old, and some were as old as six years. Today, however, six-year-old fish are rarely observed and most of the spawners are three years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically, you would have seen huge salmon coming back at older ages, but over the past century they&#8217;ve gotten smaller and younger,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;The dominant age class is now 3 years, and there are very few even at age 5, so there&#8217;s been a big shift in the age structure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Decreased size and age at maturity is a classic pattern of fisheries-induced evolution. A high mortality rate for older fish selects for fish that mature at earlier ages, because a fish that dies before it can spawn doesn&#8217;t pass on its genes. But fishing pressure is not the only factor driving changes in the age structure of the salmon population. Hatchery practices can also inadvertently select for earlier maturation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty clear that current hatchery practices are resulting in very homogeneous populations returning at age three,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;Rather than producing a uniform product, it would be better to increase the diversity of the age structure by selecting older, larger fish and making sure you get as many of them into the spawning population as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carvalho noted that improving the age structure of the population by selecting for fish that spend more years at sea (delayed maturation) would be most effective in combination with reduced harvest rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the fish remain in the ocean longer, they are exposed to the fishery and other causes of mortality for a longer period, so that reduces the number returning to spawn if you don&#8217;t reduce fishing pressure on those older age classes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Overall, the results show that maintaining or increasing the age structure through reduced mortality and delayed maturation improves the stability of the salmon population, buffering against the adverse effects of drought and making the population more resilient in an increasingly variable climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regardless of the mechanism, whether it&#8217;s reduced mortality or delayed maturation that&#8217;s driving it, increasing the diversity of the age structure will increase the stability of the population,&#8221; Carvalho said.</p>
