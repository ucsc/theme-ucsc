It is important work &#8212; in California, local steelhead populations are endangered or threatened, and the answers Sharo finds in their genomes could help us figure out how this species has been impacted by habitat loss, introduced species, and climate change.<br/><br/>As the effects of climate change continue to intensify, studying the natural environment will only become more vital, and Sharo believes that the only way we can get the brightest minds working on these problems is through mentoring new generations of scientists.<br/><br/>&#8220;Mentoring students is really important,&#8221; Sharo said. &#8220;I want the field to be a place that is welcoming and exciting for people so we get really smart interested folks into ecology and evolutionary biology. That doesn&#8217;t happen if you don&#8217;t put some effort into training them.&#8221;<br/><br/>This summer, Sharo signed up to be a mentor in a new NHGRI-funded program, &#8220;Genome Research Experiences to Attract Talented Undergraduates into the Genomics Field to Enhance Diversity&#8221; (GREAT), which welcomed six students from California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) to an intensive eight-week research program at UC Santa Cruz. The GREAT program aims to provide students from diverse backgrounds with opportunities to conduct genomics-based research and receive career training from research-intensive universities such as UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>&#8220;The GREAT scholars are not the only beneficiaries of this partnership,&#8221; said Zia Isola, director of the UCSC Genomics Institute Office of Diversity. &#8220;Building a diverse and skilled labor force is vital to support the ever-increasing demand for researchers and faculty in the field of computational genomics, and is a top priority at the state and national level.&#8221;<br/><br/>Mentees in the inaugural GREAT cohort lived on the UCSC main campus this summer and spent around 40 hours a week attending workshops on career development and working on individual research projects guided by UCSC mentors. The idea was to give them a taste of what it is like to be a research scientist and encourage them to consider careers in genomics and bioinformatics.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;It is a really ambitious program, and I mean that in a good way,&#8221; Sharo said. &#8220;It is challenging for the mentors and the students because you only have eight weeks to come up with a project, do the analysis, make the poster, and submit an abstract to a national undergraduate research conference. But I think it is good that they are pushing the students to do so much in such a short time.&#8221;<br/><br/>Andrew Sharo&#8217;s two mentees, Ezra Collins and Delight Lee, both came from CSUMB but had different majors that gave them complementary strengths when tackling a project on trout genetics.&#160;<br/><br/>Collins, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, is a biology major and already knew quite a bit about trout specifically from working on a high-school research project at a hatchery. They loved doing field work, but did not know a lot about DNA or bioinformatics. Their project in the Paleogenomics lab involved looking at genetic markers that influence migration timing, and differences in these markers between samples from current populations of steelhead trout and older samples that had been preserved for over 100 years.&#160;<br/><br/>Collins&#8217; analyses found a very slight trend toward premature migrating in current trout populations compared with the ancient samples. Carrying out this research required learning to run computational analysis on the trout&#8217;s genomes, which is not an easy feat considering the genome contains more than 46,000 known protein coding genes and huge chunks of nearly identical sequence. They said the experience gave them a new tool they can use in their studies, and made them want to learn more about programming.<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing a lot more programming than I ever have,&#8221; Collins explained. &#8220;I still have a lot to learn, but I think I have gotten better at it. It is making me want to go and pursue this more and learn more about programing designs.&#8221;<br/><br/>Delight Lee, Sharo&#8217;s other mentee, is a computer science major and so was more familiar with programming, but didn&#8217;t know much about biology or how computer science could be used to analyze data for conservation efforts.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I knew there were computer science students going into bioinformatics, but I didn&#8217;t know too much about it. I just knew there were vast amounts of genomics data that needed a lot of computer majors. I definitely gained a lot more knowledge about [the field] through this program,&#8221; she said.&#160;<br/><br/>Coming into the program, Lee had been thinking about pursuing graduate school, but wasn&#8217;t sure if she was ready. She worked on a project similar to Collins&#8217;s project, but focused on changes in the age at which the trout matured over time, rather than changes in when they spawn. While Collins struggled most with learning programming during the program, Lee struggled more with learning biology terms, particularly since English is her second language. She credits the program with helping her to learn how to handle stress, and also giving her the confidence to know that she can handle a fast-paced research environment.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Now I know I do want to go to grad school &#8211;- it gave me a good idea of what to expect,&#8221; she said.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Partnering with UCSC on this program has been an incredible opportunity for our students,&#8221; said Nathaniel Jue, associate professor of biology and chemistry at CSUMB and one of the program creators. &#8220;The world class research projects in which our students have been able to participate have been truly impactful to their development as future scientists and will have real impact on their career paths in the future.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>The program wrapped up with a presentation on August 16 at which all the mentees presented the projects and got a chance to show off all they had accomplished in just eight weeks.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;After seeing their research presentations at the end of the summer, you could see real growth in their confidence and capacities as scientists,&#8221; Jue said. &#8220;The UCSC Genomics Institute has been an incredibly supportive partner in this program and we are looking forward to providing more students with this unique opportunity.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5209922f807270460311794325ea13a4"><name>in-memoriam-linda-burman-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Linda Burman-Hall (1947-2023)</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Arts Division community was deeply saddened to hear that Professor Emerita Linda Burman-Hall, recently passed away very suddenly while travelling in Malaysia.

She </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined the UC Santa Cruz Music Department as a Lecturer in 1976, and has been a vital part of the community for the past 47 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burman-Hall retired from teaching in 2014 but became a research professor at the university. Her research was centered on performance practices and improvisation in both Western and non-Western music, and specialized in Baroque and classical literature for early keyboards such as the harpsichord, organ and fortepiano. She was also an ethnomusicologist of traditional Euro-American and Indonesian music and had published articles on South American folk fiddling, traditional and contemporary Balinese and Sudanese gamelans and Ottoman music performances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A noted harpsichordist, cultural musicologist and early music producer, she studied at the College of Letters and Science of University of California in Los Angeles (B.A. in Music with Honors), Princeton University (M.F.A. Music in Theory and Musicology, and Ph.D. Music in Theory and Musicology). She had postdoctoral research at the Institute of Ethnomusicology, University of Amsterdam. While approaching early keyboard literature from an independent perspective, she studied with Alan Curtis and Dutch scholar-performer Gustav Leonhardt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was featured in concerts at the Getty, de Young, and Huntington Museums, and on local and national radio. She performed and recorded with celebrated performers of early music and California artists, including Judith Nelson, Max van Egmond, Randall Wong, Elizabeth Blumenstock, Leta Miller, Anner Bylsma, Amy Brodo, John Dornenburg, Roland Hutchinson, and Nicole Paiement. She appeared with groups such as Philharmonia Baroque, Chanticleer, America&#8217;s premiere vocal ensemble, American Baroque Ensemble, Musica Pacifica, and the group Lux Musica of which she was a founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contemporary music, she performed with artists as diverse as Steve Reich and Meredith Monk, and commissioned, premiered and recorded new music by contemporary Indonesian composers and by her colleagues at UC Santa Cruz (David Jones, David Cope &#8211; EMI, and Robert Strizich).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burman-Hall also was the founder and longtime artistic director of the Santa Cruz Baroque Festival. Under her direction, the Baroque Festival presented hundreds of early music concerts across 46 years. Her Baroque chamber and solo music recordings are available on the Centaur, Helicon, Kleos, Wildboar, GoldenHorn, MSR, East Meets West Music, Gourd and Koustic labels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire UCSC community sends compassionate thoughts to Professor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerita Linda Burman-Hall&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> husband, Tim, and daughter, Sarina. Her loss will be felt deeply throughout the UC Santa Cruz community and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her obituary appeared in the&#160;</span><em><a href="https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2023/08/24/linda-burman-hall-longtime-ucsc-music-professor-and-baroque-festival-founder-dies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Sentinel</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and longtime Santa Cruz arts writer, Wallace Baine, paid tribute to her outstanding career in&#160;</span><em><a href="https://lookout.co/santacruz/city-life/story/2023-08-31/linda-burman-hall-santa-cruz-baroque-festival-death-legacy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lookout Santa Cruz</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noting that &#8220;with the death of Linda Burman-Hall, Santa Cruz loses one of its great artistic souls.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="65a9456980727046313555aff3959378"><name>title-ix-director</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC welcomes new Title IX director</title><summary>Julie Lewis has been named UC Santa Cruz’s new Title IX director.

During the daylong on-campus meeting of the UC Regents Special Committee on Innovation Transfer and Entrepreneurship, UC Santa Cruz had the opportunity to highlight its role as an engine of innovation and economic activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The entrepreneurial spirit runs deep at UC Santa Cruz, and it was great to have the opportunity to share our unique approach,&#8221; said Larive, noting that university faculty, students, staff, and alumni have long been at the forefront of major research advances and cultural movements. &#8220;Our history in innovation, from sequencing the human genome to pioneering the global shift toward organic farming, is extremely impressive for such a young institution, and what we are doing now and where we are heading is equally impressive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Special Committee also heard from members of the campus community via public comments about the impact UC Santa Cruz programs and resources have had on their innovation-transfer efforts. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biomolecular Engineering Professor Ed Green spoke about his experience launching three biotech companies &#8212; Dovetail Genomics, Astrea Forensics and Claret Bioscience &#8212; all of which utilize UC-patented technology, and &#8220;all of which are still going strong.&#8221; He noted that the ability to launch spinoff companies has been game-changing for the students coming out of his lab, allowing them to stay in Santa Cruz and to help build the growing community of biotechnology companies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cameron Pye, a former UC Santa Cruz graduate student and co-founder of Unnatural Products, another Santa Cruz biotech company, said the initiatives underway on campus to establish a better support system for those looking to spin off companies that draw on campus-generated innovations have the ability to create a &#8220;best-in-class ecosystem here in Santa Cruz.&#8221; The company he and co-founder Joshua Schwochert, also a former UC Santa Cruz graduate student, started in 2017 now employs 24, many of them Banana Slugs, Pye said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the day, Computational Media Professor Sri Kurniawan, whose research focuses on the design of interactive systems that help people with special needs, inspired the audience with examples of her group&#8217;s impactful work and described her experience in innovation transfer with both industry and nonprofits.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day ended with a special innovation showcase at the Westside Research Park, the off-campus research center on Delaware Avenue managed by the Baskin School of Engineering. Attendees had the opportunity to visit and engage with the Genomics Institute and learn about projects being advanced through the Lederman Lab in the Physics Department and Hybrid Systems Lab in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. Among those on hand to answer questions was Kelly Harkins Kincaid, founding CEO of Astrea and co-founder of Claret. The former postdoctoral researcher in the UC Santa Cruz Paleogenomics Lab co-founded the companies with Green. She now serves on UC President Michael Drake&#8217;s new Entrepreneurship Network Council to support entrepreneurial activity, from invention to commercialization, across the University&#8217;s 10 campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regents came away impressed. Regent Ana Matosantos said she was pleased with the approach campus leaders are taking with innovation and entrepreneurship efforts, focusing on the unique role Santa Cruz can play in biotechnology, &#8220;and how Santa Cruz and your capabilities can lift up the region.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Special Committee on Innovation Transfer and Entrepreneurship was established in 2021. It was charged with optimizing the way the University of California and its campuses promote innovation transfer and entrepreneurship, and translate their discoveries into products, services, and innovations having societal impact. On Monday, three Regents were in attendance &#8212; Regent Chair Richard Lieb, Jose M. Hernandez, and Matosantos &#8212; as was a group of external advisors and chancellors serving on the committee.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the chancellor for her presentation were Vice Chancellor for Research John MacMillan, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Innovation and Business Engagement Ryan Sharp, and Larry Samuels, who is supporting innovation initiatives at UCSC&#8217;s Monterey Bay Education, Science and Technology Center in Marina, known as MBEST.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Campus research impact on the rise</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university&#8217;s research impact has been on a strong upward trajectory, with a roughly 63 percent increase in extramural funding over the past five years, reaching over $203 million last year. The campus innovation portfolio now includes more than 350 U.S. patents under management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus in 2019 set out to develop a shared vision and framework for innovation and entrepreneurship activities, and two years later launched the Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub to advance innovation and entrepreneurship programs, facilitate expanded industry partnerships, and engage in innovation-led economic development initiatives. Organized as a partnership between the UC Santa Cruz Office of Research and University Relations division, the Hub represents a creative approach by campus units to pool staff resources and expertise to advance the collective work of the university. The Hub acts as the point of entry for industry partners, investors, and entrepreneurs to connect with the university&#8217;s discoveries, innovations, resources, and talent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, UC Santa Cruz has made significant progress on several programs and initiatives to advance innovation and entrepreneurship, and to further encourage a campus culture that recognizes the value of innovation, and fosters an opportunities-centered mindset around translational research, commercialization, and partnering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example is the Chancellor&#8217;s Innovation Impact Awards Program, held for the first time earlier this year. It recognizes and celebrates university faculty, researchers, staff, students, and community partners for their valuable contributions to innovations that have catalyzed transformative change and societal impact. Another program &#8212; the Innovation Catalyst Grant &#8212; focuses on providing targeted gap funding, training, mentorship, and support to UC Santa Cruz researchers advancing early-stage technology innovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hub is also working to build a supportive innovation ecosystem. What has become known as the Innovation Champions Network provides those on campus involved in entrepreneurship efforts with a forum for information sharing, strategic planning, and special initiatives coordination. The network includes members from several long-standing campus organizations including the Center for Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurial Development (CIED), student organizations like Student Creativity Empowerment and Entrepreneurship (SCEE), and the university&#8217;s two Institutes for Science and Innovation, QB3 and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am proud of the work the Hub team and our campus partners have done to build a coordinated innovation ecosystem,&#8221; said Assistant Vice Chancellor Sharp. &#8220;Effectively leveraging our resources and aligning our efforts, we can fill gaps and address the unique needs of our innovators.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>The path to expanded innovation transfer</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus leaders discussed ways to enhance innovation transfer and entrepreneurship activities. They voiced support for a partially decentralized approach that would allow UC to continue to provide back-office support and specialized services, and the creation of a systemwide proof-of-concept fund to help finance promising innovations. Freeing up staff time by eliminating inefficiencies created by antiquated centralized software tools, such as the one used by many campuses to track patents, was also a topic of conversation, and campus leaders backed a recommendation made at the systemwide level to revise promotion and tenure guidelines to include consideration of innovation and entrepreneurship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz has an unparalleled opportunity to broaden impact around our established and emerging areas of research excellence, crossing domains of human and planetary health, drawing on computer science and engineering synergies, and leveraging our strengths in social justice and community engagement,&#8221; said MacMillan, who heads the campus Office of Research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short&#160; and moderate term, campus leaders said, UC Santa Cruz is well-positioned to accelerate innovation activity in two areas &#8212; climate action and advanced aviation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of climate action, UC Santa Cruz has seen early success with its recently launched Center for Coastal Climate Resilience, and the university is looking to increase this momentum through the continued build-out of the Hub&#8217;s Climate Action Solutions Catalyst program, funded through the UC Climate Action Innovation and Entrepreneurship Awards. The program aims to advance the development and adoption of solutions addressing California&#8217;s most pressing climate challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In advanced aviation, campus has an opportunity to build on its leadership in existing aviation and drone initiatives to boost regional economic growth by fully activating MBEST. The center is on part of the land UC received from the U.S. Army in 1994 when Fort Ord was closed. It is adjacent to the Marina airport, which currently houses a facility run by Joby Aviation, one of the world&#8217;s leading fully-integrated eVTOL aircraft companies. The surrounding region is also home to other prominent advanced aviation companies. This industry cluster is reflected in ongoing economic development initiatives.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="66a5d44280727046313555af64366a6d"><name>national-hsi-week-2023</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>HSI Initiatives and El Centro invite campus community to celebrate National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Awareness Week</title><summary>As we prepare to welcome our students, staff, and faculty to the start of the 2023 fall quarter, we are excited to first celebrate National Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Awareness week next week: September 11 - 17.</summary><start-date>1693897200000</start-date><display-name>HSI Initiatives and El Centro invite campus community to celebrate National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Awareness Week </display-name><path>/2023/09/national-hsi-week-2023</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/09/national-hsi-week-2023</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1693939258410</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1694461544931</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/09/images/hsi-week-main-image-2023</path><link>site://news/2023/09/images/hsi-week-main-image-2023</link><site>news</site><name>hsi-week-main-image-2023</name><display-name>hsi-week-main-image-2023</display-name><file-size>33063</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/09/hsi-team.png</path><link>site://news/2023/09/hsi-team.png</link><site>news</site><name>hsi-team.png</name><display-name>hsi-team.png</display-name><file-size>20985</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear UCSC Community,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we prepare to welcome our students, staff, and faculty to the start of the 2023 fall quarter, we are excited to first celebrate </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/about/events/national_hsi_week.html#https://www.hacu.net/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=3739"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Awareness week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next week: September 11 - 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HSI Week is an opportunity to celebrate and build awareness of the work and the important role HSIs play in improving access to education and advancing equity practices for underserved students. Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) are higher education institutions that enroll more than 25% of Hispanic students. Only 19% (571) of higher education institutions meet this definition but HSIs enroll 62% of all Latinx students. UCSC is proud to be certified with the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/seal-of-excelencia.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seal of Excelencia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2022-2025) which recognizes our intentionality and historical effectiveness in serving our Latinx students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past year, </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HSI Initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://elcentro.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">El Centro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deepened our partnership through our unwavering commitment to centering and elevating student voices. We recognize the importance of building a campus community that embraces our students&#8217; voices and stories and provides an opportunity for students to share their cultural knowledge and experience. This year, we are building even more opportunities to engage with students, staff, faculty, alumni, and the community about our role as a Hispanic-Serving Institution and what servingness looks like to us.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us as we continue to connect and build community:&#160;</span></p>

UC Santa Cruz Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Marco Rolandi&#8217;s lab and collaborators at MIT have created a device that mimics this biological concept in order to detect disease.<br/><br/>Using their bioprotonic system, a device that integrates electronic components with biological components and uses electrical currents of protons, the researchers can detect biomolecules that indicate the presence of human disease, among other applications. Details on this device were newly <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40870-1">published in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em></a>.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Cells tend to be interconnected &#8212; they talk to each other, or they talk to the external environment, using these intermembrane channels,&#8221; Rolandi said. &#8220;What we set out to do with our collaborators at MIT was create an artificial ion channel in a way that we could tune the properties of the ion channel and its functionality as we desire.&#8221;<br/><br/>Using a technique called DNA origami, the researchers at MIT can bioengineer a strand of DNA, which naturally forms the shape of a double helix, into any shape that they want. For this project, they created a tiny tunnel specially programmed for a stream of protons (H-plus) to optimally travel through. This tiny channel is known as a nanopore, a concept which was <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/nanopore-feature.html">originally pioneered at UCSC</a>.&#160;<br/><br/>The DNA nanopore sits within Rolandi&#8217;s bioprotonic system, which is designed to mimic the watery, ion-conducting world of the cellular environment. A double layer of lipids similar to a cell membrane separates water representing the environment outside of a cell from an electrode representing the inside of a cell, and the embedded nanopore acts as a channel between the two sides.<br/><br/>The electrode sends a stream of protons through the nanopore channel to the other side of the nanopore, where there is a molecule binding site that can be customized so specific biomolecules of interest attach to it. If one of those molecules is present in the water, it will attach to one end of the nanopore and block the stream of protons through the channel.&#160;<br/><br/>The device translates the proton signal into an electronic signal that the researchers can read. When the device does not detect protons flowing through the channel, the researchers know that a biomolecule is present.&#160;<br/><br/>The device also includes two handles made of cholesterol which position themselves across the lipid bilayer and improve the conductivity of protons through the nanopore channel.<br/><br/>&#8220;The uniqueness of the approach is the combination of these proton-conducting devices with supportive lipid bilayers, and I believe we are the only groups that are working on those, with this dock design for the DNA nanopores,&#8221; Rolandi said. &#8220;The novelty is both the integration of the device and the ability to sense using these DNA nanopores.&#8221;<br/><br/>In the paper, the researchers show that they are able to use the bioprotonic system for the detection of the biomolecule B-type natriuretic peptide, an indicator of cardiac disease. This shows the potential of the device to be used for biomolecule detection in an in-vitro or clinical setting.<br/><br/>In the future, the researchers envision the device could contain multiple nanopores, each programmed to detect a different type of biomolecule.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely part of the attractiveness of the system &#8212; in the near future we could multiplex, so we could have a full suite of biosensors,&#8221; Rolandi said.<br/><br/>UCSC researchers Le (Dante) Luo, Yunjeong Park, and Jesse Sanchez contributed to this paper. Researchers from the University of Washington and the TOBB University of Economics and Technology in Ankara, Turkey also participated in this project. The research was supported by the National Science Foundation.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="70b4a54c807270463a86478f5a3c820e"><name>daniel-anderson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumnus Daniel Anderson receives Wilhelm Exner Medal for scientific achievement in business and industry</title><summary>Alumnus Daniel Anderson received the 2023 Wilhelm Exner Medal in Vienna, Austria.

The Merrill college graduate (Merrill &#8217;92, biology and mathematics) grew up in Berkeley and later went on to UC Davis for his doctorate work before heading to MIT in the late 1990s, but Santa Cruz has always held a special place in his life&#8217;s trajectory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s just an amazingly beautiful place&#8212;it&#8217;s easy to like,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Anderson has taken the skills he learned from the Pacific Coast campus and translated them into worldwide recognition, including his most recent award honoring his direct contributions to science and business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May of this year, Anderson received the 2023 </span><a href="https://www.wilhelmexner.org/en/quotes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilhelm Exner Medal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Vienna, Austria. The award&#8212;presented by the Austrian Industry Association (AIA), and dating back to 1921&#8212;is given to those who have made significant advancements in their respective scientific fields. That impact goes on to influence both business and industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Anderson, as reflected in the announcement from the organization, his achievements have &#8220;changed the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to when he first arrived at Science Hill, however, Anderson wasn&#8217;t sure what career to pursue.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was officially undeclared for two years, because I had no idea what I wanted to do,&#8221; he said. "I was taking classes from philosophy and psychology to biology.&#8221; Ultimately, he picked mathematics because he was good at it, even though he didn&#8217;t have &#8220;a grand vision of how I might use it in the future.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He soon thereafter claimed a second major in biology, leaning into the school&#8217;s recognized study in molecular biology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson worked with </span><a href="https://mcd.ucsc.edu/faculty/feldman.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Jerry Feldman (emeritus)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a year, learning more about molecular biology in the lab through Feldman&#8217;s specialty in biological clocks. He recalls those experiences helping to further push his efforts toward an advanced degree, and ultimately moved to Davis to pursue his graduate work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at Davis, Anderson says he felt prepared for the level of study from his time at UCSC, with his wide plethora of biology, molecular biology and biochemistry classes ensuring he could &#8220;get through&#8221; his first year in graduate school.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forwarding to the end of his graduate work, Anderson was confused as to what his next steps could look like. Davis allowed Anderson to focus on DNA repair in bacteria, and he enjoyed the science aspect of his work&#8212;yet, he still felt he wanted to do something focused more on medicine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, he soon found a new opportunity, 3,037 miles away: a postdoctoral research fellowship for chemical engineer and professor Bob Langer at MIT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving to Cambridge in 1999, Anderson soon recognized his interest in multidisciplinary research which&#160; allowed for inter-lab cross collaboration with chemists, biologists, material scientists, and pharmacists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was that transition to MIT where I became interested in developing materials for medicine and new delivery systems for gene therapy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Along the way, I started building a research group,became a professor, and became interested in taking some of the technologies we developed and getting them into the real world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last 30-plus years, Anderson has honed his impact on various research areas, including medical devices, cell therapy, gene therapy, and material science. He has been a core member of the school&#8217;s </span><a href="https://imes.mit.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Medical Engineering and Science program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (launched in 2012), a member of the </span><a href="https://ki.mit.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a member of the </span><a href="https://hst.mit.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson has also founded several companies, including Living Proof, Olivo Labs, Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), Sigilon Therapeutics, Verseau Therapeutics, Orna, and VasoRx. He recently received a $25 million grant from Sanofi to advance his RNA research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;MIT is a wonderful environment for developing new technology, and it&#8217;s also a great environment for taking these inventions out to help the general public,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One specialty that Anderson yearned to focus on was creating nanoparticle nucleic acid systems, similar to what&#8217;s used in the COVID-19 vaccine. Over the years, his work has gone on to clinical trials, and has been a foundation for starting new companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a fun journey, and it&#8217;s been interesting to go from working in a field that nobody&#8217;s ever heard of to one where everybody&#8217;s had these nanoparticles in their arms,&#8221; he joked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since visiting Vienna for his award ceremony, Anderson has continued his research back in Massachusetts, with a few other trips in between lab sessions. Looking forward, he hopes the award shows the importance of what he and his teams have been able to achieve so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Any award is an honor&#8212;it&#8217;s a recognition from our peers. In this case, it&#8217;s for economic impact, which I think is nice as it highlights the fact that some of our work has left the lab and gone on to help create jobs and products,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking back on his time at UCSC, Anderson acknowledges that there may have been a path where he never went into biotechnology&#8212;but ultimately, everything worked out</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The experience with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s great faculty and the environment made me excited about moving forward in this direction,&#8221; he said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7140c33b807270463a86478f2deeab56"><name>breast-cancer-grant</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New long-term NIH grant supports breast cancer research</title><summary>Cancers are easier to treat if caught early on in their development.

Once the cancer cells metastasize and spread around the body, the disease becomes more difficult to target. Shaheen Sikandar, an assistant professor of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was recently awarded up to seven years of funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institute of Health (NIH), to study the process of metastasis in breast cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The R37 MERIT Award from the NCI supplies $344,000 per year for a guaranteed five years. In the fourth year of her grant, Sikandar can apply for two additional years, which would bring the total award amount to $2.4 million. The funding will support Sikandar&#8217;s lab in researching why certain breast cancer cells metastasize.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And if we can understand the mechanisms as to what's going on within those cells, we&#8217;ll have a better way to treat metastatic disease,&#8221; said Sikandar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before joining UC Santa Cruz three years ago, Sikandar identified a small population of cells within breast cancer tumors that are more likely to metastasize than other cancer cells from the same tumor. These cells, known as LMO2+ cells, only make up one to two percent of tumor cells. But their impact is major. Cells that express the LMO2 gene exhibit more plasticity&#8212;the ability to change characteristics&#8212;and are more likely to metastasize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sikandar&#8217;s lab has already made some progress in understanding the cells. Isobel Fetter, a UC Santa Cruz PhD Candidate in Sikandar&#8217;s lab, found that the LMO2 gene regulates which DNA repair pathway a cancer cell chooses. This could have implications in cancer therapy, Sikandar says. But several questions remain.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do only one to two percent of cells express LMO2,&#8221; asked Sikandar. &#8220;And even though it's such a minority population, it has such a big impact on the metastasis. So is there a way that we can target this minority population of cells?&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new grant will ensure long-term, stable funding for continuing the work. The lab will use a combination of patient-derived xenografts, mouse models and cell lines to better understand the LMO2+ cells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m elated,&#8221; said Sikandar, adding that she would&#8217;ve been happy with a standard, five-year R01 grant. &#8220;But the fact that it was an R37 is even better because I have an opportunity for two more years,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I&#8217;m very excited about it.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="714bc6a3807270463a86478f83de08cf"><name>porter-mural</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Student mural at Porter envisions a future without police</title><summary>A mural by Irene Juarez-O’Connell, addressing community safety and policing, is now on display at the Porter Study Center at Porter College.</summary><start-date>1694070000000</start-date><path>/2023/09/porter-mural</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/09/porter-mural</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1694117906063</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1694122480009</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Wilson</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/09/images/1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-001.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/09/images/1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-001.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-001.jpeg</name><display-name>1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-001.jpeg</display-name><file-size>102625</file-size><width>500</width><height>338</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/09/images/1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-0011.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/09/images/1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-0011.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-0011.jpeg</name><display-name>1-6-1-23-porter-mural-project-carolyn-lagattuta-001.jpeg</display-name><file-size>16932</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irene Juarez-O&#8217;Connell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a senior at UC Santa Cruz in 2012, she sought out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Jota Lea&#241;os</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Professor of&#160;Film &amp; Digital Media at the university, looking for a quote on the role of the arts in Latino civic engagement in San Francisco&#8217;s Mission district for a research project she was working on. Then, a couple years ago, Lea&#241;os got in touch with Juarez-O&#8217;Connell because he was teaching a class on public art and its role in political movements and wanted her to give his students a tour of the murals she&#8217;d done in the Santa Cruz Beach Flats in Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was kind of a full circle moment,&#8221; Juarez-O&#8217;Connell said. &#8220;From there, he said, &#8216;Well, do you think that you'd ever want to do a mural with students?&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mural Lea&#241;os asked Juarez-O&#8217;Connell to be the lead artist on, addressing community safety and policing, is now on display at the Porter Study Center at Porter College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lea&#241;os was pretty much the perfect person on campus to ask to work on this mural. He&#8217;s a Guggenheim fellow whose animation work has been in the Sundance Film Festival and the Morelia International Film Festival, Mexico, and he has had installation exhibitions at the Whitney Biennial in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. He&#8217;s worked on dozens of murals as well as starting a digital mural program at San Francisco&#8217;s famous Galer&#237;a de la Raza, a Chicano arts nonprofit. He thinks working with students on this provided a great opportunity, combining research with experiential learning. Putting paintings in public spaces like Porter is one of the best ways to communicate, he thinks.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The great muralists, the Mexican muralists, were like, &#8216;We're going to put indigenous stories on the walls,&#8217; and &#8216;We're going to teach history for the illiterate,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;All that history is part of mural making in educating, developing, and building community.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juarez-O&#8217;Connell agrees. The full-time director of programs at Food What?!, a nonprofit that works with high school students to grow and cook food, she doesn&#8217;t take on a lot of mural projects. But she made time to work on this one.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>The project came out a recommendation from the&#160;</span><a class="c-link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/committees/community-advisory-board.html" delay="150" href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/committees/community-advisory-board.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Campus Safety Community Advisory Board</a><span>, which provides advice and recommendations to the chancellor on issues related to campus and community safety.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lea&#241;os recruited students, and Juarez-O&#8217;Connell and her partner Victor Cervantes brainstormed with them, drawing on butcher paper and responding to prompts about public safety and police. The artists also looked at pictures of campus protests over the years, and the finished product includes UC Santa Cruz Professor Emerita </span><a href="https://humanities.ucsc.edu/academics/faculty/index.php?uid=aydavis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angela Davis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in front of a sign reading &#8220;Abolish Prisons.&#8221; Other signs in the mural say &#8220;Huelga,&#8221; &#8220;Keep Cops Off Campus,&#8221; and &#8220;Mutual Aid is an act of Love.&#8221; The middle section, Juarez-O&#8217;Connell says, imagines a campus with no police, with a group of students holding a banner reading, &#8220;We Take Care of Us&#8221; and a police car seemingly fading back into the land, with vines growing up it and the tires coming off.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juarez-O&#8217;Connell says she and the students are pleased with how it turned out.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t quite believe it&#8217;s up because there&#8217;s not a lot of murals on campus like it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s telling a story of something that is possible. Envisioning a future without police &#8212;I think that&#8217;s radical.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="717d48c3807270463a86478f51307d11"><name>kevin-lunzalu</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Alumnus Kevin Lunzalu wins major award for his work in  plastics pollution reduction around the world</title><summary>UCSC alumnus Kevin Lunzalu received an award from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since June, Lunzalu has graduated from </span><a href="https://csp.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s Coastal Science and Policy Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of the program&#8217;s fourth cohort, spoke as the student speaker for his graduating class, returned to his native country, Kenya, to get back to work with his organization </span><a href="https://youth4biodiversity.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and was named one of the 7 New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) </span><a href="https://www.nyas.org/awards/new-york-academy-of-sciences-marine-science-and-oceanography-teaching-fellows/?tab=2023%20fellows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marine &amp; Oceanography Fellows 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, he&#8217;s added another milestone to that already impressive list: an award from </span><a href="https://www.thegef.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Global Environment Facility (GEF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 21, Lunzalu traveled from Kenya to Vancouver, Canada, to accept the award and speak to the larger consortium during the Seventh GEF Assembly. The Assembly was attended by representatives of all 185 member countries. It also featured keynote addresses from Canada&#8217;s Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Hon. Steven Guilbeault, and from Canada&#8217;s Prime Minister, Hon. Justin Trudeau. </span><a href="https://www.thegef.org/newsroom/press-releases/winners-inclusive-gef-assembly-challenge-program-announced-vancouver"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This award is one of just 23 awarded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to individuals and nonprofits across the globe from the first-ever inclusive GEF Assembly Challenge Program.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, this year&#8217;s awards are working directly with civil society organizations, meaning the funds go directly to the people on the ground doing the work. As such, Lunzalu&#8217;s organization received a direct grant of $100,000 to put toward their continued efforts at addressing common environmental challenges through innovative youth solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As exciting as this news is, Lunzalu remains humble and thoughtful about how the last few years&#8212;from Kenya to Santa Cruz and back again&#8212;have helped him to reach this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Lunzalu co-founded the </span><a href="https://youth4biodiversity.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from his homebase in Busia, which over the years has become one of the country&#8217;s largest youth-led conservation organizations. In 2018, he met Abel Mkulama in Nairobi; years later, Mkulama (a 2021 graduate of the CSP program, based in Malawi) reached out to Lunzalu to encourage him to apply for the CSP program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He took me through the process, told me about UCSC as an institution, and I was particularly excited that the program is different from other Master&#8217;s or graduate programs, because it&#8217;s centered on grassroots action and the link between science and policy,&#8221; Lunzalu said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunzalu was accepted to start the program in September 2021, and his move to Santa Cruz marked his first time in the United States. He notes that the move&#8212;some 9,450 miles from Kenya&#8212;was a major shift, but his cohort and the university as a whole made it easier to settle in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is generally welcoming, and my cohort was 10 people&#8212;I love my cohort, I miss my cohort so much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They would invite me for Thanksgiving with their families, my landlords would give me a bike to move around, take me to the movies, share quality time with me, follow up on my progress, cheer me on, and introduce me to new people. I met my project co-advisor, Mr. Dan Brumbaugh, through my landlord! To me, it meant everything that I had met this new family.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunzalu compares the CSP Program Director, Professor Anne Kapuscinski, to a mother figure, helping to make him both comfortable and more confident in his two-year track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he started in the program, Lunzalu aimed to learn more about how to create a tool that could help significantly reduce plastics waste ending up in the ocean, particularly in nesting zones of key species, namely endangered sea turtles. This has been a tremendous problem in his native country, leading to a &#8220;pollution crisis&#8221; in the Indian Ocean, and Lunzalu wanted to find a solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The CSP program is designed in a way that students come in with their ideas for solving a coastal problem, but they are taken through a very thorough process of fine-tuning these ideas, making them more practical and more efficient,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, Lunzalu worked diligently with Kapuscinski and his faculty advisors, Katherine Seto and Dan Brumbaugh, to refine his ideas and finalize a capstone project to conduct in his second year. For his capstone, Lunzalu looked at informing policies on a national and local level to lead to a significant reduction of plastics. He also worked with his vast network and the Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network to mobilize beach management and routine cleanups, all while creating a growing marine debris database to characterize plastics pollution on the beaches themselves.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can now use this data on ocean plastics to engage policymakers, show them what shows up on the beach, and identify potential sources of the plastic waste to give us an idea of where to focus efforts to reduce plastic pollution at its source,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the assistance of Kapuscinski, Lunzalu connected with the Wildlife Conservation Network (WCN) and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, both on his capstone project and in continuing conversations related back to his work in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapuscinski remembers when she first interacted with Lunzalu&#8212;during the second round of interviews for the CSP program&#8212;that he was an incredibly effective communicator, very engaging, and already a clear leader. Those elements have furthered in their time together and his recent award illustrates his future influence on the global stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would always help to spread the word about what Kevin was doing,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she notes, Lunzalu has received a number of awards since starting at UCSC. The addition of GEF is no surprise.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I imagine him becoming a really major national leader,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s going to keep moving forward on getting more of our decision makers to not only accept, but actually act at the nexus of climate action and biodiversity conservation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Lunzalu is dedicated to the Kenyan Youth Biodiversity Network and seeing how much further he can grow this network with other organizations. With the GEF funding, Lunzalu will work with other youth organizations from six other countries as part of a biodiversity alliance.&#160;</span></p>

of 2024</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birong Hu (M.S. &#8217;00, computer science) has a message for young women interested in STEM: &#8220;Believe in Yourself!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She reinforces this message through her support of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Girls in Engineering (GiE), a summer program that provides middle school students opportunities to engage in hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Girls face mounting barriers to pursuing educational and career paths in STEM,&#8221; Hu says. &#8220;They don&#8217;t always receive the encouragement and opportunities [that boys do]. And for girls from underrepresented backgrounds that&#8217;s even more true. So Girls in Engineering is a program that is very important to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a study by the </span><a href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Association of University Women (AAUW)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 74 percent of middle school girls express interest in STEM fields and subjects.&#160; By the time they reach high school, however, only 15-20 percent of girls continue to express interest in pursuing STEM careers. Their fading interest can be attributed to a variety of factors, including limited exposure to role models, lack of hands-on experiences, and social pressures. A lack of female representation in STEM fields can lead to feelings of isolation and underrepresentation for young girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Girls in Engineering offers middle school students opportunities to explore and reinforce their interest in engineering. During the week-long summer camp, students build, code, and fly drones; visit state-of-the-art research labs; create their own robots; and explore careers and educational opportunities available to them in the STEM fields. Importantly, they see and interact with college students, scientists, and engineers who mirror their backgrounds and lived experience&#8212;allowing them to envision themselves learning and working in STEM.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have been so lucky to have been surrounded by brilliant women when I was in school and in the workforce,&#8221; Hu says. &#8220;These girls, especially if they are seeking a scientific career, can benefit so much from role models and leaders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Girls in Engineering has proven to be the experience that encourages students to stay on the path toward higher education and careers in STEM. Past participant Sophia Natividad was in Girls in Engineering as an eighth grader. Today she is a biochemistry major at the University of Chicago working toward a career in research. Girls in Engineering also inspired Iris Manriquez&#8212;now a software engineer at Twitch&#8212;to pursue a career in STEM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Girls in Engineering shows students that this future is an achievable option for them&#8212;and allows them to truly imagine it,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hu&#8217;s gift will fund a cohort of 25 middle school students to participate in Girls in Engineering next summer 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hu has a stellar STEM background.&#160; She received her B.S. degree in biochemistry from Peking University, M.S. in computer science from UC Santa Cruz, and Ph.D. in molecular biology from UCLA. Early in her career, she worked as an engineer at Ventro Corporation and Agilent Technologies in the Bay Area.&#160; Her professional career has also included translating and publishing two educational books from English to Chinese. She co-founded a bilingual children&#8217;s library, Peekabook House, which has grown into a well-recognized independent children&#8217;s library, with several branches in Beijing and Tianjin.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, she partnered with fellow alumni of Peking University to form SV Tech Ventures. Since its founding, SV Tech Ventures has been active in investing in early stage startups mainly in the areas of healthcare, new energies &amp; materials, consumer products, IOT technology, and media &amp; telecommunications.&#160; Hu serves as the financial controller at SV Tech Ventures. She recently joined the UC Santa Cruz Baskin Engineering Dean&#8217;s Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Council members can play a key role in opening doors for faculty and students. We really view them as valued partners,&#8221; says Alexander Wolf, Dean of Baskin School of Engineering. &#8220;Birong&#8217;s success brings an important network to Baskin Engineering, and we are grateful for her active participation in the council.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hu is impressed by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s commitment to supporting students, particularly students from historically underrepresented backgrounds, on their college pathways.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think public universities should play a role [in creating opportunities],&#8221; Hu says. &#8220;If public universities don&#8217;t, then who will? UC Santa Cruz is really doing a better job than even the larger UCs. UCSC pays more attention to underrepresented students and has accepted more this year.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/08/admissions-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 5,500 new Banana Slugs admitted this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">34 percent will be the first in their families to attend a university, a 27 percent increase over last year's admitted cohort, and 37 percent are from low income families. UC Santa Cruz extended admissions offers to 1,723 African American high school and transfer students from California, 11,206 Chicanx/Latinx California high school and transfer students, and 304 American Indian high school and transfer students from California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy&#8212;and really honored&#8212;to contribute to Girls in Engineering. I would really like to see these girls go on to college. I want them to know they can do it. If they work hard, take the tough courses in high school, and believe in themselves, they can set the foundation for their success,&#8221; Hu says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambert is recognized by the seismology section for his fundamental theoretical advances.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through an elegant blending of numerical, analytical, and observational approaches he has&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shown that the largest earthquakes on the planet are likely operating at low stresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborator UC Santa Cruz Professor Emily Brodsky remarks that Assoc. Researcher Lambert &#8220;is the rare breed of theorist with a deep understanding of the important questions in the observations and complex data of earthquake science.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honorees will be recognized at AGU23, which will convene more than 25,000 attendees from over 100 countries in San Francisco and online everywhere on 11-15 December 2023. This celebration is a chance for AGU&#8217;s community to recognize the outstanding work of our c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">olleagues and be inspired by their accomplishments and stories.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internships are coveted opportunities for college students nationwide. Yet, unpaid internships rather than paid,&#160; disproportionately disadvantage first-generation, underrepresented, and low-income college students. UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute for Social Transformation is combating that inequity, one student at a time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its second year, </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/transforming-futures-interns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;a program within the Division of Social Sciences&#8217; Institute for Social Transformation&#8212;awarded up to $7,500 scholarship stipends to 12 students (double the amount of its inaugural year) from underrepresented backgrounds to allow them to pursue unpaid internships over the summer. The instrumental hands-on experience these students gained from their summer internships wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without financial support.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures&#8217;s mission is to open up opportunities and remove financial barriers for first-generation, underrepresented, and/or low-income college students at UC Santa Cruz so they can participate in career-advancing summer internships. All funds for the Transforming Futures program were made available to students through the generosity and invaluable support of </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/transforming-futures-donors.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MR Macgill and Ho Nam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who were attracted to the campus because of its reputation for supporting first-generation college students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MR says she is committed to amplifying opportunities for students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is clear that internships provide an important experiential learning opportunity for students to gain professional experience, build professional networks, create future career pathways, and are an important component of student success,&#8221; MR said. &#8220;But unfortunately, a number of meaningful internships are unpaid, particularly at non-profit or government organizations, and therefore are not an option for many students with limited financial resources.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-year student Leslie Salgado (Kresge &#8217;25, psychology) says it would have been impossible for her to pursue her dream internship without the support of a Transforming Futures scholarship.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel very fortunate to live in a community where donors make it possible for us to immerse ourselves in this short but intense internship without worrying about financial expenses,&#8221; Salgado said. &#8220;I know that otherwise, I would have never gotten the opportunity to participate in an internship of this form, which was a very impactful and great experience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the </span><a href="https://cdn.fourwaves.com/static/media/filecontent/421fe962-b1c7-492c-ac87-616a8f8d12ff/81343264-b367-419f-acce-fa67da670532.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Colleges and Employers 2021 Student Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><strong>74% of white students said they&#8217;d had unpaid internships and 73% had paid internships, compared to 8% and 6.6%, respectively, for Black students and 10.2% and 7% for Hispanic or Latinx students. Among first-generation students, 25.6% reported they were unpaid interns, and 20.5% were paid.&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re called the Institute for Social Transformation,&#8221; Institute Director of Operations Evin Knight said. &#8220;So trying to offer these transformative experiences to the students, especially students who might not be able to take advantage of those opportunities otherwise, is instrumental to our identity and mission.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight and Chris Benner, Director of the Institute for Social Transformation and the Everett Program for Technology and Social Change, spearheaded the debut of Transforming Futures in 2022 with the invaluable support of the Experiential Learning Team of the campus&#8217;s </span><a href="https://careers.ucsc.edu/about/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Career Success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> department. Career Success Internship Coordinator Lauren Orme was instrumental in designing the program and preparing the students to benefit the most from their internship experience. Dean of Social Sciences Katharyne Mitchell emphasized the importance of offering a program like Transforming Futures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m truly thrilled that we have been able to continue to provide this type of experience for our students,&#8221; Mitchell said. &#8220;Transforming Futures is a rare program that can change student lives in constructive and meaningful ways for the long term. I&#8217;m so grateful to everyone who makes this initiative possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Career-advancing opportunities</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Salgado always knew she wanted to work with kids. So when the opportunity to work with children arose this summer, she knew she had to pursue it. Salgado spent the past three months interning at </span><a href="https://www.jacobsheart.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacob&#8217;s Heart Children&#8217;s Cancer Support Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacob&#8217;s Heart provides family-centered care that addresses the emotional, practical, and financial struggles for families of children and teens during cancer treatment, families experiencing anticipatory grief, and those who are bereaved. Salgado had heard about the organization while she was a long-time volunteer at Second Harvest Food Bank.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got to see how important impactful organizations like these are and how important it is to have them in our community,&#8221; Salgado said. &#8220;The resources they provide for families in need make a big difference. I&#8217;ve also always known that I wanted to work with kids, so I knew that having the opportunity to work with them would be a great experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a clinical therapist intern at Jacob&#8217;s Heart, Salgado worked on updating case notes, participated in weekly meetings where challenging cases were discussed, created service fliers, did a hospital visit, and more. She says that the experience she gained allowed her to explore multiple paths in the psychology field. She is excited to pursue other internships in the future to continue exploring different paths and hopes to pursue a Master&#8217;s degree after graduating from UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salgado emphasized that she is grateful to have participated in a program like Transforming Futures.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I want to thank the Jacob's Heart team, the donors, UCSC, and everyone else who made this possible for all of us."&#160;</span></p>

The program tied for fifth place with Rochester Institute of Technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As the gaming industry continues to grow in significance and complexity, our Computer Game Design program equips students with the technical, narrative, and creative skills needed to excel in this dynamic field,&#8221; Chancellor Cynthia Larive said. &#8220;This recognition is well-deserved, and also underscores the vital role of game development in today's cultural and economic landscape.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The computer game design industry is a multibillion dollar industry, with a size and scope that continues to grow.&#160; Its vast ecosystem spans developers, publishers, and a passionate player base in the hundreds of millions.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advancing excellence in game development and design</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Computer Game Design program, part of Baskin Engineering&#8217;s Computational Media Department, provides students with unique opportunities to engage in boundary-pushing research and education. Students integrate technical expertise, interpretive skills, and design work to create human-centered media solutions addressing complex societal challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has been a leader in game development education since 2004 when Professor of Computational Media Jim Whitehead launched a program for computer science students interested in game development. The introduction of the B.S. in Computer Game Design program in 2006 marked a significant milestone, being the first of its kind in the UC system and one of the few nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the intervening years, the computer games design faculty have earned recognition for their outstanding contributions to the field. Among the highest accolades for computer games scholars is the distinction of becoming a Fellow of the Higher Education Video Game Alliance (HEVGA). UC Santa Cruz holds the record for having the most HEVGA Fellows among all universities worldwide&#8212;an unmistakable testament to their commitment, dedication, and excellence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased that UC Santa Cruz has been recognized for its overall excellence in games education,&#8221; Whitehead said. &#8220;The campus is committed to educating a diverse student body that will actively contribute to the growing diversity of the California computer games industry. We take pride in our track record of offering an economically accessible education to students from various backgrounds.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Computer Game Design program falls under the Baskin School of Engineering, students also have the flexibility to enroll in courses offered by the Department of Performance, Play, and Design within the Arts Division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grounded in the ethos of experiential learning, the Performance, Play and Design program immerses students in the fundamentals of artistic practice while delving into the rich history of both digital and non-digital game design. This interdisciplinary program ensures students receive a holistic education encompassing art, technology, theory, and practice, fostering adaptability and creativity.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empowering students and amplifying our impact</span></h3>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>Creating a digital presence that reflects excellence and impact, UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu">debuted today a new homepage</a> with a modern and responsive design, crisp language, stunning photos, and compelling videos.</p>
<p>The new site, enabled by the launch of a <a href="https://websites.ucsc.edu">campuswide WordPress service</a>, marks a new era for showcasing UC Santa Cruz to the world.</p>
<p>Leaders with Information Technology Services and University Relations worked closely on the WordPress service, the campuswide theme to reflect the campus's design standards, and the new homepage.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz is an incredible campus, and I am so thrilled that we have a new website and content platform that will enable us to demonstrate that to the world," said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;This website sends a powerful and clear message about who we are and what drives us to do our best work. This new site is a step toward making our digital presence as impressive as our physical one.&#8221;</p>
<h2>A powerful first impression</h2>
<div class="callout-right narrow">
<h3>See it in action</h3>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/3XLRqZoUJCPfzCKN7">Sign up to be invited to an information session</a> in October to see the new theme, hear more about why we chose WordPress, and how folks are approaching their web planning.</p>
</div>
<p>Many people&#8212;including prospective students and their families, faculty, and staff&#8212;turn to the web to learn more about UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>The reimagined website is designed to deliver a clear message about the campus's excellence in research, teaching, and learning, and supporting students in becoming leaders who will create real, lasting change in the world. <br/><br/>The new site aims to easily and seamlessly guide visitors to the top questions that people have about the university including academics, research, admissions, financial aid, campus life, and more.<br/><br/>The new homepage features a 35-second video montage of the campus, students, events, and the iconic Banana Slug, points of pride, edge-to-edge images, and a fluid design that adapts to all screen sizes.<br/><br/>Over the past several months, several other UC Santa Cruz websites have shifted to WordPress, including <a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/">The Teaching and Learning Center</a>, and <a href="https://gch.ucsc.edu/">Global and Community Health</a>.<br/><br/>Over the coming year, University Relations and ITS will be working to help site managers reimagine and refresh high-visibility websites as they migrate to WordPress. The team will also begin building a modern news site to create more dynamic and engaging news articles that can better feature photos, videos and other dynamic elements. The goal is to launch a refreshed news site by summer 2024.</p>
<h2>Built on modern technologies</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz in mid-August launched the <a href="https://websites.ucsc.edu">new campuswide Wordpress service</a>, beginning a multi-year transition to a new content management system after more than a decade with Cascade WCMS. <br/><br/>WordPress enables more flexibility and creativity, while also ensuring a consistent look and feel for users. It also prioritizes accessibility so that UC Santa Cruz can continue to provide equal access for everybody.<br/><br/>WordPress is the most popular content management system and powers nearly 43 percent of all websites, according to Web Technology Surveys. Building and maintaining websites should be much easier, and the popularity means new staff members can more quickly help maintain the campus&#8217;s digital presence. <br/><br/>The new service also provides an easy way for staff and faculty to get started building an improved web presence with resources and support. The includes guides, trainings, and information about attending regular open labs so that the campus community make the most out of WordPress and the new web theme. <br/><br/>To get started, site owners should confirm that WordPress will suit their needs and begin developing a strategy for creating and maintaining an effective website, including understanding the needs of site visitors. The move to WordPress also provides an opportunity to improve the digital experience across campus websites.</p>
<h2>Continuing to iterate</h2>
<p>Adopting WordPress as the primary content management system for UC Santa Cruz will enable Information Technology Services and University Relations to keep pace with changes in the digital environment, both in evolving the look and feel and in implementing new features.<br/><br/>The theme and underlying service will continue to be expanded and developed over the years ahead. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ae354f448072704653a8eb255ec88ad2"><name>citris-funding</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Fund your student research project or event with the 2023 CITRIS Tech for Social Good program</title><summary>The Tech for Social Good program provides up to $5,000 in funding for research projects and up to $1,000 for events.</summary><start-date>1695106800000</start-date><path>/2023/09/citris-funding</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/09/citris-funding</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1695139843891</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1695139895940</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/09/images/citris-funding.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/09/images/citris-funding.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>citris-funding.jpeg</name><display-name>citris-funding.jpeg</display-name><file-size>14361</file-size><width>306</width><height>135</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The Tech for Social Good program provides up to $5,000 in funding for research projects and up to $1,000 for events</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2023 CITRIS Tech for Social Good program at UC Santa Cruz is now open for proposals from student teams, with an application deadline of November 15, 2023.

These new grants, administered by the <a href="https://innovation.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Innovation &amp; Business Engagement Hub</a>, are designed to support and propel early-stage technology innovations developed by UCSC researchers.&#160;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s grant recipients are <a href="https://stemcellgenomics.ucsc.edu/people/david-haussler/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">David Haussler, </a>distinguished professor of biomolecular engineering and scientific director of the <a href="https://genomics.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Genomics Institute</a> with <a href="https://danserlab.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mircea Teodorescu</a>, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering, and <a href="https://holman.chemistry.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ted Holman,</a> professor of chemistry and biochemistry.&#160;</p>
<p>Haussler and Teodorescu were awarded $50,000 for their work in developing a revolutionary approach to cell culture that allows for more efficient testing on human organoids. Their innovation eliminates the need for traditional incubators in cell culture by using &#8220;incubator-free&#8221; vessels that do not rely on air intermediates for gas regulation. This breakthrough technology promises to significantly enhance the realism and scalability of experiments in biological research and will enable higher-fidelity experiments in all areas of biology. The device will also allow for new discoveries in cancer treatment, stroke, heart attack, and brain development research.</p>
<p>Yohei Rosen, a postdoctoral scholar who works closely with Haussler and Teodorescu at the Genomics Institute, is leading the project.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Innovation Catalyst Grant is a huge help in accelerating our development of a new method of cell culture. It gives us the freedom to validate and scale our technology outside of the constraints of traditional research grants,&#8221; Rosen said. &#8220;Internally, the technology we are developing is an important part of the Genomics Institute&#8217;s big push to deploy transformative technologies for computer-integrated, automated biology. We are excited that the grant is taking this even further, supporting our ability to de-risk our invention to allow its commercialization. This will allow the technology to stand on its own outside of UCSC, helping external groups perform new experiments we haven't even imagined yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ted Holman, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, received $41,520 to help fund work on a therapeutic for heart bypass and transplant patients. Holman&#8217;s project is focused on jumpstarting the drug discovery process for cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) by developing a novel human 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) inhibitor, determining its properties, demonstrating its effectiveness in a mouse model. &#160;</p>
<p>Approximately 350,000 people in the United States receive heart bypass surgery every year, with more than 90,000 experiencing CIRI after surgery. There are currently no therapies on the market to prevent CIRI, so Holman&#8217;s innovation could not only save the healthcare industry and patients from costly surgeries but, more importantly, it could save lives.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The money from the Innovation Catalyst Grant is crucial because it will help me gather preliminary pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, which can subsequently be used to inform the formulation and establish the case for follow-on funding to further develop this treatment,&#8221; said Holman.&#160;</p>
<p>The Innovation Catalyst Grant program, which was established to foster transformative change and societal impact through innovation, provides targeted gap funding, training, mentorship, and support to UC Santa Cruz researchers. The program helps de-risk and validate the implementation and adoption potential of cutting-edge technology innovations from the university.</p>
<p>Haussler and Holman&#8217;s teams also participated in the <a href="https://officeofresearch.ucsc.edu/iatc/lean-launchpad/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lean Launchpad workshop series</a> as part of the program, which provided them with training on identifying pathways for adoption and implementation and finding a scalable business model through the customer discovery process. The series taught them how to better translate their science to potential funding agencies. In addition to this training, both teams are working with industry mentors from the external Selection Committee who are providing direct market insights and guidance on advancing the innovations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Securing resources to de-risk and validate an early-stage innovation has been a longstanding challenge for university researchers,&#8221; said Ryan Sharp, assistant vice chancellor of Innovation &amp; Business Engagement, who is overseeing the program. &#8220;This work is at a stage generally beyond the scope of basic research funding but is typically necessary to position the innovation for attracting investment capital. I am thrilled that we launched the Innovation Catalyst Grant program this year to help fill this gap in the innovation capital landscape while also providing our researchers with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the pathway to innovation implementation and adoption.&#8221;</p>

The federal Public Health Emergency ended in May, along with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements for federal employees and federal contractors. California&#8217;s COVID-19 State of Emergency ended in February, and the California Department of Public Health rescinded its healthcare worker vaccination requirement in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 16, 2023, the University issued its Policy on Vaccination Programs &#8211; With Interim Revisions. The interim revisions moved the University&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccination program to a systemwide&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opt-out program for all covered individuals. The University&#8217;s seasonal influenza vaccination&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">program remains an opt-out program. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, the University of California Office of the President is moving to finalize the changes published in August and invites comments on the key provisions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy will require covered individuals to either be up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccination or to opt out of COVID-19 vaccination. In the event applicable law or public health orders impose stricter vaccination requirements, such as for healthcare workers, the policy will continue to require compliance with those stricter requirements.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As policy will enable covered individuals to opt out of COVID-19 vaccination in lieu or needing to or receive a University-approved exception, model forms and other content regarding the exception process were removed.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 vaccination program implementation guidelines were removed. Relevant language regarding vaccination data moved to the main policy. Policy noncompliance language was added to the main policy, including citations to relevant University policies.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removed content regarding rescinded California Department of Public Health (CDPH) health care worker vaccine requirement.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated language consistent with current public health usage. Removed outdated deadlines and content.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The draft policy is posted on the Policy Coordination website at the UC Santa Cruz Policy Coordination </span><a href="https://ucscpolicy.ellucid.com/manuals/binder/24"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website for policies in open comment.&#160;&#160;</span></a></p>

This award is presented to an individual to recognize excellence in organized teaching and advising in some aspect of fisheries education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palkovacs is the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Director of the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://fisheries.ucsc.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fisheries Collaborative Program</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">which supports collaborative projects between UC Santa Cruz and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#8217;s (NOAA) Southwest Fisheries Science Center. He is also a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> professor of Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology, where he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in freshwater ecology and fisheries ecology, and has been the faculty mentor for the </span><a href="https://ucsc.fisheries.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz-Monterey Bay Area Student Subunit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since its founding in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excellence in Fisheries Education Award recognizes Palkovacs&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">k</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ey contributions to fisheries education through teaching, mentoring, and DEI efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palkovacs engages students who take his courses in active learning and connects theory with practical applications. He is an engaged mentor and adviser for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers alike. He has advised 11 Ph.D. students, five master&#8217;s students, 10 postdoctoral researchers, and many undergraduate thesis projects, and has served on numerous graduate advisory committees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students and researchers he has mentored have gone on to secure esteemed positions in the realm of academia, state and federal agencies, and prestigious non-governmental organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Palkovacs is active in creating an inclusive culture by launching programs such as the Diverse Voices in Fisheries Science seminar series, which takes place annually at UC Santa Cruz. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diverse Voices in Fisheries Science events offer a platform for diverse speakers to share their research and create space for early career scientists to network with professionals in the industry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palkovacs&#8217;s research interests include freshwater ecology, eco-evolutionary dynamics, fish ecology, fisheries management, and conservation. He is particularly interested in the ecological consequences of intraspecific genetic and phenotypic variation and applications of eco-evolutionary dynamics for fisheries management. He is also actively engaged in conservation and management of U.S. Pacific coast anadromous fishes &#8211; fish that migrate to spawn &#8211;and river herring of the U.S. Atlantic coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For those who know my work, you might know that I am interested in &#8216;extended phenotypes&#8217; &#8211; the traits of organisms that go on to shape their environments,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;To me, teaching and mentoring are our most powerful &#8216;extended phenotypes.&#8217; Through these, we can share knowledge and experience, inspire new ways of thinking and acting, and build community and broaden diversity. We are all both mentors and mentees. I encourage everybody to exercise your own &#8216;extended phenotype&#8217; for the betterment of our field, our fisheries, and our world.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2><strong>Dr. Priya Crosby</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Priya Crosby, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ph.D., is a European Molecular Biology Organization (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMBO) long-term postdoctoral fellow in the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at UC Santa Cruz. She researches circadian rhythms, the 24-hour biological oscillations that occur in almost all animals, plants, and some bacteria that allows them to anticipate daily events. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The circadian rhythm that is likely familiar to most of us is the sleep-wake cycle, but there are thousands of other biological processes that have a circadian rhythm and vary across the day, from hormone levels to wound healing. In fact, few biological processes don&#8217;t have a circadian rhythm. At their smallest level, circadian rhythms happen in single cells&#8211;every single cell in our bodies&#8211;and it is the collection of these rhythms in every single cell that drives rhythms in whole organisms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosby focuses specifically on how these cellular rhythms work in mammals. She does this using an approach known as protein biochemistry that allows her to look at how proteins&#8211;one group of chemical building blocks that make up a cell&#8211;interact with each other to generate this 24-hour circadian oscillation at the subcellular level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosby was introduced to the circadian field during a lecture series in the final year of her undergraduate degree. She remembers being immediately fascinated by it. She was (and still is) amazed by the fact that our biology is intrinsically linked to the fact that we live on a rotating planet and so have a circadian day-night cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She went on to complete her Ph.D. in the field under the supervision of </span><a href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/john-oneill/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John O&#8217;Neill at the MRC-LMB in Cambridge (UK)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, before moving to UC Santa Cruz to do a postdoc with Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Carrie Partch. In Crosby&#8217;s words, O&#8217;Neill and Partch have been phenomenal mentors to her and are responsible for shaping the scientist that she is today. &#8220;They are both intensely analytical in their approach to questions, and both are entirely unafraid to push the boundaries of the field, thus serving as brilliant examples,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosby is currently in the process of starting her own lab back in the UK. "I&#8217;m extremely excited about this; I can&#8217;t wait to build a team to start asking all the questions I&#8217;ve been thinking about for the last ten years!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For her work as a postdoc at UCSC, Crosby received one of two </span><a href="https://graddiv.ucsc.edu/postdocs/outstanding-postdoc-award/2023-outstanding-postdocs.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Graduate Division Outstanding Postdoc Awards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a prize of $1,500 for professional development, that she plans to use to attend a conference next year. She received the award at the June 2023 UCSC Postdocs Association Symposium. In response to receiving the award, Crosby states, &#8220;It was a huge surprise and honor, and I am extremely grateful.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2><strong>Dr. Will DeRocco</strong></h2>
<img alt="William DeRocco" height="447" src="images/will-derocco_780.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;" width="335"/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will DeRocco works on the overlap of &#8220;beyond the Standard Model phenomenology&#8221; and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">strophysics. In other words, he uses stars and planets to look for evidence of new physics. A major target of his work is dark matter, which we know makes up eighty percent of all matter in the Universe. But we have no idea wh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at it is! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeRocco's work extends more broadly than this, though, with much of his recent attention being directed toward gravitational wave detection with pulsar timing arrays and looking for free-floating planets with &#8220;gravitational microlensing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeRocco knew he wanted to be a physicist as early as third grade. He read a book by Michio Kaku at the time and, despite understanding virtually none of it, thought, &#8220;this is what I want to be doing.&#8221; In fifth grade, he hand-wrote a letter to CERN, the famous particle physics laboratory in Switzerland, with a series of questions. A researcher there surprisingly wrote a letter in response and encouraged him to keep at it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a transformative moment for him, and from then on, he was committed. He pursued his interest in physics through high school, eventually getting invited to work at a lab at Yale during his summers. When he entered college as an undergraduate, he had the opportunity to work at CERN, which felt to him like the "completion of a cycle"...&#160;except it wasn&#8217;t the end! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As DeRocco continued his studies, he realized that experimental physics wasn&#8217;t exactly right for him. "<span>These hands should not be trusted to build </span>anything," he explains. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e then explored theory before eventually settling on theoretical astrophysics in graduate school.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>"It&#8217;s been two decades since I decided to do physics and I </span>still<span>&#160;can&#8217;t get enough of it," DeRocco said.</span>&#160;In the future, he hopes to be a professor or lab scientist at an institute and build a career around his interest in physics.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alumni are at the forefront of innovation, the cutting-edge, and social justice. They are inspirers, ground-breakers, world-changers, truth-seekers and tellers. With a population of over 145,000, UCSC alumni are the voices that will define the century.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alumni Association at UCSC is proud to present this year&#8217;s honorees of the <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/alumni-awards/2023/">UCSC Alumni Awards</a>. These awards recognize and honor alumni who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievements, made distinct contributions to society, provided impactful contributions to UC Santa Cruz, and who have embodied the values and spirit of the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are honored to recognize these outstanding alumni,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Vice Chancellor of Alumni Engagement John D. Pine. &#8220;This year&#8217;s UCSC Alumni Award recipients have made significant contributions to their alma mater, the state, the country, and the world. We are beyond excited to celebrate this year&#8217;s honorees.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://specialevents.ucsc.edu/events/alumni-awards/2023/">UCSC Alumni Awards</a> consist of four categories: Fiat Lux, Alumni Achievement, Outstanding Recent Alumni, and UCSC Ethos.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fiat Lux Award honors alumni and friends of UC Santa Cruz who have demonstrated outstanding achievement and distinguished service in support of the university&#8217;s programs and goals. This year&#8217;s Fiat Lux awardees are Lisa Rose, Susan (Su) Nerton, and Jim Lapsley for their multi-year dedication to Crown College which recently resulted in raising $1 million for the Crown College Endowment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jim, Lisa, and Su&#8217;s work will have a long-lasting impact on Crown College,&#8221; said Crown College Provost Manel Camps in his nomination of the trio. &#8220;Through their constant presence, they have modeled for current students what it means to continue to be engaged with the college. I have no doubt in my mind that they deserve the Fiat Lux Award for their outstanding achievement and distinguished service in support of Crown College.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alumni Achievement Award is presented to UC Santa Cruz graduates who are renowned for their distinguished professional achievement, leadership, and service to the community. This year UC Santa Cruz is proud to present the award to bell hooks (posthumously) and Mark Philips. With over 30 books and articles to her name, hooks&#8217;s world-renowned contributions to the literary field amplify Black voices and expand feminist ideals. Phillips has made key contributions and discoveries both in the fields of active galactic nuclei and supernovae.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Outstanding Recent Alumni Award recognizes UC Santa Cruz alumni who have graduated within the past 10 years, who are recognized for their notable achievements. Abel Pineda&#8212;the youngest person to ever serve as Council Member, Vice Mayor, and Mayor on the San Pablo City Council&#8212;will receive the award.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Abel's extensive experience in public service and leadership has made a profound impact on the San Francisco Bay Area and communities throughout California,&#8221; said nominator Guadalupe Morales. &#8220;As the one of youngest mayors in the state, Abel has spearheaded transformative initiatives in the City of San Pablo, including expanding college access, providing COVID-19 relief, and advocating for high-quality education. His remarkable achievements, dedication, and commitment to positive change truly exemplify the core values of UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC Ethos Award recognizes alumni who have demonstrated a deep and abiding commitment to causes of social justice, diversity, equity and inclusion, and who exemplify and enrich UCSC&#8217;s principles of community. Bettina Aptheker, alumna and Professor Emeritus of Feminist Studies at UCSC, will receive the award for her scholar and activist work during the Free Speech Movement, the LGBT Movement, and the international movement to free Angela Davis. Her actions during pivotal moments in history, along with her 40-year teaching career at UCSC, embody the ethos of the university.&#160;</span></p>

The Air Quality Index (AQI) generated by the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat%3D36.4859632%26lng%3D-121.73266650000001%26zoom%3D10&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695336139053000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2UrLB5EMXT448_1419iQSP" href="https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=36.4859632&amp;lng=-121.73266650000001&amp;zoom=10" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>EPA&#8217;s AirNow system</span></a>&#160;provides general air quality ranges along with corresponding health messages. Over the next several days, the air quality in the region is expected to reach &#8220;Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups&#8221; to &#8220;Unhealthy&#8221; overnight and into the morning.</span></p>
<p><span>For air quality levels that are &#8220;Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups,&#8221; the EPA advises people to keep outdoor activities light and short and that anyone feeling symptoms from poor air quality should go indoors.</span></p>
<p><span>For areas with &#8220;Unhealthy&#8221; air quality levels, the EPA advises that some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.</span></p>
<p><span>The AQI for campus locations and the Santa Cruz area is likely to continue changing over the next few days.</span></p>
<p><span>At the current air quality level, some people may be more comfortable staying inside and minimizing exposure to outdoor air. Others with preexisting medical conditions that may be exacerbated by elevated airborne particulates are encouraged to follow recommendations from their medical provider.</span></p>
<p><span>Campus affiliates with respiratory illness, other medical conditions that may be exacerbated by smoke exposure, and any others that may be concerned about their smoke particulate exposure may pick up filtering masks (N95s) from the following locations:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I accepted the invitation to serve on this task force because of my commitment to diversify the academy and recruit, retain, and promote faculty of color in psychology,&#8221; Azmitia said. &#8220;And I was drawn by the opportunity to work for two years with colleagues from around the country who shared this commitment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force recently released their final&#160;</span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/tenure-promotion-faculty-of-color"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a>&#160;on the topic,<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;which captures the myriad obstacles that college and university faculty of color in psychology face in their pursuit of promotion and tenure. Those challenges include disproportionate financial constraints from student loans and limited research funding, the expectation to engage in &#8220;invisible labor&#8221; in support of campus DEI efforts, workplace issues like microaggressions and social isolation, and mismatch between what institutions value in the promotion process and what faculty members themselves value in their work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also offers recommendations to address these issues including:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing faculty of color with effective, engaged mentoring from the time of hire through promotion, tenure, and advancement across all domains important to the institution</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviewing promotion and tenure processes to evaluate the presence of implicit biases</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educating department colleagues and academic administrators about the prevalence and scope of invisible labor expectations and demands, and their toll on faculty of color</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including metrics beyond traditional metrics such as citation counts to evaluate impact of a promotion or tenure candidate&#8217;s work</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding the definition of scholarly excellence to include contributions to the public good</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying policies and procedures to address the conditions in an academic department that lead to attrition and retention challenges for faculty of color.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is imperative to act upon these findings and work towards fostering an inclusive and equitable academic environment where all faculty members, regardless of their racial or ethnic background, can thrive and contribute to the advancement of the field,&#8221; the report concludes.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cd94fb5e8072704653a8eb2564bf674a"><name>vcsas-welcome-to-fall-quarter</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Vice Chancellor Akirah Bradley-Armstrong shares a welcome message with all students</title><summary>As we kick off the 2023-2024 academic year, Akirah Bradley-Armstrong, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success, shares a welcome message with all UC Santa Cruz students. </summary><start-date>1695625200000</start-date><display-name>Vice Chancellor Akirah Bradley-Armstrong shares a welcome message with all students</display-name><path>/2023/09/vcsas-welcome-to-fall-quarter</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/09/vcsas-welcome-to-fall-quarter</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1695666207553</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1695683555141</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/09/akirah-headshot-thumbnail</path><link>site://news/2023/09/akirah-headshot-thumbnail</link><site>news</site><name>akirah-headshot-thumbnail</name><display-name>akirah-headshot-thumbnail</display-name><file-size>16224</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Welcome to fall quarter, Banana Slugs!</article-subhead><article-text><p><img alt="welcome-week-website-billboard.png" class="" height="266" src="../welcome-week-website-billboard.png" width="830"/></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="#spanish">Spanish version</a></p>
<p>Dear slugs,</p>
<p>Welcome to the 2023-2024 academic year! My name is Akirah Bradley-Armstrong, and I am proud to be your vice chancellor for student affairs and success. As we begin a new year, I wanted to be among the first to welcome you to campus.&#160;</p>
<p>Whether this is your first year as a Banana Slug or you are graduating in the Spring, I want you to know how excited we are that you are here. You are the reason UC Santa Cruz is such a special place. Your dreams, your hopes, and your unwavering belief in a better tomorrow are central to our community&#8217;s vibrancy.&#160;</p>
<p>And, so, as we begin a new quarter, I invite each of you to make this year your best year yet.&#160;Try new things. Meet new people. Pursue your interests with unabashed tenacity. Commit to your goals. Advance your studies. Expand your co-curricular activities.&#160;</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already&#8211;and are interested&#8211;join a student organization. If you are already in a student organization, consider a leadership position. Apply for an on campus job or pursue that dream internship. Plan for the future, but be sure to enjoy every single&#160; UC Santa Cruz moment you can.</p>
<p>Take in the breathtaking views of the bay from East Field. Go support your fellow slugs at a sporting event&#8211;soccer, basketball, volleyball, and more. Attend a concert in the Quarry Amphitheater. Go for a hike with your roommates. Find your first banana slug&#8211;it&#8217;s good luck to find one before your first exam. Snap a photo with Sammy. Head to the beach for a day of fun in the sun. Connect with friends, staff, and faculty. In all you do, take care of yourself&#8211;and each other.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>To kick start this new year and help deepen your connection to campus, we&#8217;ve planned a fun-filled Welcome Week. The excitement begins Monday, September 25 with Laser Tag in the Stevenson Event Center and continues through Saturday, September 30 with Movie Night in the Quarry.&#160;</p>

Encuentra tu primera babosa bananera: da buena suerte encontrar una antes del primer examen. Hazte una foto con Sammy. Ve a la playa a divertirte bajo el sol. Con&#233;ctate con amigos, personal y profesores. En todo lo que hagas, cuida de ti mismo y de los dem&#225;s.</p>

Those accomplishments only crack the surface of her contributions</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to space, ocean, and Earth exploration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recognition, Sullivan was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Washington, DC,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on Sept. 22.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is a huge honor,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;When I read through the roster of previous enshrinees, every</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">name I recognized was someone I&#8217;d heard about since I was a kid. They&#8217;re legendary names</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that first flew, that established the earliest airplane production companies, the airlines we know</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">today, and the aerospace companies of today. So it&#8217;s very wonderful company to join.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Aviation Hall of Fame was founded in 1964 in Ohio&#8212;the birthplace of aviation&#8212;as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a museum, learning and research center, and an annual awards ceremony. It recognizes the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tenacity, genius, and ingenuity of the people of air and space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We believe this is an excellent class, and we are already looking forward to their induction in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington, DC,&#8221; NAHF Board of Nominations Chair Tom Lodge said in a May press release</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing the enshrinees. &#8220;From pioneers Benn and Coffey to visionaries Gittens and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stimpson and to aerospace heroes Haise and Sullivan, the NAHF&#8217;s Class of 2023 represents</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the best in aviation. We applaud the Board of Nominations for their challenging and thorough</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">work.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan served as Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Obama administration, was the Former President and CEO of Ohio&#8217;s Center of Science</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Industry, and was appointed by President George W. Bush to the National Science Board.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Sullivan flew on three shuttle missions, including the mission that deployed the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubble Space Telescope. She says aiding the deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope was</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the most transformative moments of her career.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m fortunate to have one very tangible legacy that I&#8217;m quite proud of and tickled by,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and that&#8217;s the Hubble Space Telescope,&#8221; Sullivan said. I played a significant role in getting that vehicle to orbit and ensuring that NASA had the tools and equipment needed to keep it running,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and it&#8217;s now been running for well past twice its expected lifetime. Then there&#8217;s the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transformations that Hubble has wrought in the world of astronomy and cosmology. &#8216;Impressive&#8217;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is way too weak a word for how transformative it&#8217;s been. It&#8217;s wonderful to have played a role and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">made it happen along with thousands of other people. It&#8217;s great to be on Team Hubble.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>From UC Santa Cruz to the Beyond</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan has repeatedly underscored that her undergraduate education at UCSC was the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">foundation for her groundbreaking career. Sullivan entered her first year at UCSC pursuing a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">B.A. in foreign languages, but after a couple of science courses and an encounter with Earth &amp; Planetary</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sciences Professor Gary Griggs, Sullivan&#8217;s curiosity was piqued. She asked him what an</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">oceanographer does, and instead of dismissing her question, he heard the curiosity beneath it;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He responded to the interest, invited me up to his lab the following Saturday, and spent</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">three-quarters of a day fielding my questions, one after the other.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan soon switched her major to Earth and planetary science. She says the encounter</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transformed her education, and she hopes to offer current students pivotal opportunities through</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a planned gift to UCSC, which will augment a student award fund she already established and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">also will support the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kathryn D. Sullivan Research Impact Award in Earth &amp; Marine Sciences supports teams</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">consisting of an undergraduate and a graduate student mentor in conducting research projects.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Awardees receive financial support that covers their living expenses for a summer plus funds to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">participate in laboratory or field research, attend conferences, or engage in other professional</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">development activities. Award winners build scientific knowledge while shaping a broad</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding of environmental stewardship and policy issues.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The kind of experience I had at UC Santa Cruz, the ability to actually do some real things that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">count in the real world and to work closely under professors and grad students, that&#8217;s</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transformative. There&#8217;s plenty of research that confirms the value of undergraduate research</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">experiences in impacting careers.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This academic year, UC Santa Cruz welcomes 54 new faculty members to the campus, bringing the number of Senate Faculty&#160; to 686. They bring a wide array of expertise in research and creative scholarship that will open new areas of investigation and expression and expand existing areas of work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to welcome our new faculty members,&#8221; Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer said. &#8220;These dynamic scholars and educators join a vital faculty community committed to creative and innovative research and scholarship, teaching, mentoring and service that enriches our campus, our diverse communities, the state and far beyond.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The&#160; research, scholarship and creative endeavors of the new faculty, often interdisciplinary, traverse the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences and social sciences. Their distinct areas of inquiry and performance include Afro-Latin social dances; game design; machine learning; refugees, borders and colonialism; climate change; aquatic ecosystems, human-computer interaction; food systems and economic equity; and archeological preservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz prioritizes inclusive hiring practices. We are in the process of adding 100 additional Senate faculty members by 2032. Coupled with an anticipated 200 to 250 additional faculty hires to replace departures due to retirement and separations, UCSC has an unparalleled opportunity to advance its research impact, bolster student success and increase the diversity of our faculty to better reflect our campus and the state of California. Of the new senate faculty, 35% identify as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx or Multiple Races, 28% as white and 13% as Asian.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the ethnic identification of non-emeriti senate faculty is 55% white, 17% Asian, 9% Multiple Races, 7% Hispanic/Latino/a/x, 3% Black/African American, 1% identify as either American Indian/Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.&#160;</span></p>

(photo by&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nestor Guerrero)</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Today, two UC Santa Cruz researchers were honored at the Library of Congress for the invention of nanopore sequencing, which became a new and revolutionary method to read DNA and RNA.<br/><br/>David Deamer and Mark Akeson, both emeritus professors of biomolecular engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering, received the American Association for the Advancement of Science&#8217;s (AAAS) Golden Goose Award for the invention. Their colleague and friend Daniel Branton, a Havard biologist and co-inventor of the technology, was also honored.&#160;<br/><br/>The Golden Goose award is given to scientists whose federally-funded research was seemingly obscure or silly at the outset but created a deep societal impact. Each year, three groups of scientists are lauded by members of congress for their contributions to transformational research breakthroughs in a variety of science and engineering fields.&#160;<br/><br/>The concept for nanopore sequencing technology, licensed to the UK-based company Oxford Nanopore Technologies, led to the creation of the MinION, the only hand-held device for genetic sequencing, priced at a fraction of the cost of other sequencers. This transformational technology allows sequencing to take place in remote and resource-poor environments and has enabled some of the most significant genomics breakthroughs of the last two decades.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I like to think of scientists as prospectors, and grants are the grubstakes that keep us going while we search for new knowledge,&#8221; Deamer said. &#8220;Like the rare prospector who discovers the motherlode, the discoveries emerging from basic research can sometimes change the world. The three of us have a sense of deep satisfaction that we helped to increase our understanding of how the human genome functions in health and disease.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Nanopore&#8217;s impact</strong><br/><br/>Nanopore sequencing is a unique method for achieving long reads of DNA and RNA. Long read sequencing means scientists can read longer stretches of genetic material all at once, instead of piecing together the short pieces that are achieved with traditional short read technology. Long reads are essential for whole genome sequencing efforts, such as the first complete sequence of a human genome and the first human pangenome, both efforts led by UCSC Genomics Institute researchers.&#160;<br/><br/>Use of nanopore sequencing technology is widespread across the genomics field &#8212; there are currently around 73,000 research publications that cite the technology. It is being used in a large number of current wide-scale genomic studies, from mapping the spread of diseases such as Ebola and Covid-19, to understanding the genetic mechanisms that regulate cancer, to creating resources for the protection of endangered species.&#160;<br/><br/>Nanopore sequencing is revolutionary because its size and portability allows sequencing to happen anywhere beyond just a typical lab setting. It can be taken to remote or resource-poor areas to do on-demand sequencing, and empower local scientists and clinicians to do DNA and RNA sequencing in their communities. The MinION has even been taken to the international space station to sequence the organisms growing there.&#160;</p>
<p>Akeson called the award a great honor, noting the rich history of the field that began when Nobel Prize-laureate Fredrick Sanger initiated the modern era of DNA sequencing.<br/><br/>&#8220;Beginning with Sanger Sequencing in 1977, DNA sequencing technology has impacted all of us,&#8221; Akeson said. &#8220;It is an honor to be a part of this legacy.&#8221;</p>

Each of the bases of DNA (A, G, C, and T) have slightly different sizes and chemical properties, and so make a distinct change to the current as they are pulled through it. These base-specific changes are then translated to read the genetic material.&#160;<br/><br/>Deamer came up with the initial concept for nanopore sequencing in 1989 while at UC Davis researching nucleic acids, the material that makes up the bases of DNA and RNA. He moved to UC Santa Cruz in 1994 where he began research on his new idea, recruiting Akeson and Branton as collaborators on a project that seemed impossible to many in the field.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;When we began to work with nanopores there was extreme skepticism, which is why the Golden Goose award is recognizing nanopore sequencing,&#8221; Deamer said. &#8220;Think about it &#8212; we were proposing to pull a single molecule of DNA through a nanoscopic pore, then detect and identify each base as it zipped through. Impossible! Because it seemed so unbelievable, for ten years we were the only group working on the idea.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I often tell students to be skeptical when they read research papers because exaggeration and even fraud happen in science and technology,&#8221; Akeson said. &#8220;But I also tell them that obstinate rejection of new ideas or theories is wrongheaded. Just look at the early days of CRISPR or AI to see how wrong critics can be. In the case of nanopore sequencing, our colleague Dan Branton challenged obstinate skeptics to explain what physical law prevented implementation of the technology. The usual answer was a muffled &#8216;There is no fundamental law &#8211; it's just too hard,&#8217; before the critics scurried off. So we persevered &#8211; another lesson for students.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After years of experimentation in the labs at UCSC and Harvard, the team was able to solve a myriad of biological and technological challenges to prove their idea was viable. These ideas were licensed in the form of patents to the founders of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), and in 2012 the company unveiled the MinION, the first device for nanopore sequencing.<br/><br/>The MinION was sold for just $1,000 at a time when competing devices were $100,000 and up. Since then, ONT has improved the speed and accuracy of the technology significantly and now offers several other more powerful devices for nanopore sequencing such as the GridION and the PromethION.

NAHM, a nationwide extravaganza, aims to showcase the profound impact that arts and humanities have on our lives and society.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After three decades since its inception, this month-long observance continues to enlighten the public about the magic of creativity and knowledge brought forth by these fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"National Arts and Humanities Month raises public awareness about the ways these disciplines foster creativity and new forms of knowledge, bringing meaning to our lives,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder. "Our series of on-campus events will help our students learn what it means to become citizens of the world, whether they are engaging with a message of justice at the Arivu concert or considering issues of identity and community at the Festival of Monsters."</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In today's rapidly evolving world, the importance of humanities and the arts is abundantly clear," Alinder said. "As we navigate complex technological advancements and global challenges, it is the humanities that provide us with a profound understanding of our history, culture, and the human experience. The arts, in all their diverse forms, allow us to express our creativity, emotions, and perspectives, fostering empathy and connection in an increasingly disconnected world. They serve as a mirror to society, reflecting its values, aspirations, and struggles.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers of National Arts &amp; Humanities month point to the many ways in which these disciplines contribute significantly to critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovation, while providing an intellectual and emotional foundation for a more enlightened and compassionate future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As research repeatedly shows, the arts help understand ourselves and each other and what binds us together,&#8221; said UCSC Arts Dean Celine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parre&#241;as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">himizu. &#8220;The pandemic surely proved the arts as necessary for survival. The arts help us to grapple with the unpredictability of life itself. NAHM makes art accessible, bringing the community together to experience the power of the arts and humanities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is no stranger to the cultural and artistic significance of NAHM, and this year is no exception. The campus has curated a captivating lineup of events, including a not-to-be-missed free open-air concert featuring the groundbreaking Indian rapper </span><a href="https://csas.ucsc.edu/ambassa-in-america-featuring-arivu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arivu on October 7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This musical extravaganza promises to deliver an electrifying message of justice to the audience. Another highlight will be the annual </span><a href="https://www.monsterstudies.ucsc.edu/2023festival"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Festival of Monsters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which starts on an appropriately monstrous day: Friday the 13th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of some key events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In keeping with the&#160; celebration&#8217;s spirit, Arivu will perform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the Quarry Amphitheater at UCSC at 8 p.m. on </span><strong>Saturday, October 7. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doors open that evening at 7 p.m. The concert is being presented by the Center For South Asian Studies (CSAS) at UC Santa Cruz. </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/ambassa-in-america-featuring-arivu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advance registration is required for concert attendees.&#160;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through his singles such as &#8216;Anti-Indian,&#8217; &#8216;Kalla Mouni,&#8217; and &#8216;Sanda Seivom,&#8217; Arivu is known as a prodigal talent with the guts to speak truth to power.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arivu has achieved a high profile in India for his powerful music aimed at, among other things, destroying the country&#8217;s rigid caste system, "</span><a href="https://lookout.co/santacruz/wallace-baine/newsletter/2023-09-14/book-bans-censhorship-baroque-fest-linda-burman-hall-js-bach-arivu-rapper-ucsc-quarry-amphitheater-sol-festival-best-bets-osmosys-app-work-around"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lookout Santa Cruz</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in its recent write-up of the upcoming show.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the UCSC concert, Arivu will lead members of his Ambassa band, an experiment in bringing together the western elements of hip-hop, beat boxing and rock with the native sounds of Folk, Gaana, and Oppari.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ambassa&#8217;s mission is to showcase the need for justice in an increasingly divided India, through the transformative as well as rousing powers of music,&#8221; said UCSC Professor of Feminist Studies Anjali Arondekar, founding director for the Center For South Asian Studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On</span><strong> Sunday, October 8, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Humanities Institute at UCSC and Bookshop Santa Cruz are </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/oliver-jeffers-begin-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsoring an author talk at the bookshop with Oliver Jeffers, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">globally renowned artist and internationally bestselling author. Jeffers will read from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BEGIN AGAIN: The Story of How We Got Here</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where We Might Go</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an artistic journal through humankind&#8217;s history. Jeffers examines humankind&#8217;s shared motivations for existence in his first illustrated book aimed at a broad audience. This event includes a solo presentation by Jeffers, a moderated Q&amp;A, and book signing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the highlights of the month-long arts and humanities celebration will take place </span><strong>October 13-15. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;UCSC&#8217;s unique </span><a href="https://www.monsterstudies.ucsc.edu/2023festival"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Festival of Monsters, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">presented by UCSC&#8217;s Center For Monster Studies, will call attention to the many monsters that dwell in the murky depths of popular culture, film, art, and literature, allowing artists and writers to explore the themes of social conflict, prejudice, and injustice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From werewolves to kaiju, from ghosts to golems, from doppelg&#228;ngers to Dickens, from the medieval to the modern, the 2023 Festival of Monsters explores the monstrous through scholarly, creative, dramatic, and visual mediums, offering us all new and exciting ways to think about monstrosity,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Performance, Play &amp; Design Professor and Chair Michael M. Chemers, director of the </span><a href="https://www.monsterstudies.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Center For Monster Studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Monsters intrigue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">us as much as frighten us for their capacity to shiver our orthodoxies and, in so doing, present the possibilities for new (transgressive) ways of being,&#8221; Chemers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Held in two locations in Santa Cruz, the 2023 Festival includes a</span><a href="https://bit.ly/PublicMonster"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">free public day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a paid</span><a href="https://bit.ly/MonsterConference"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">academic conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with performances, readings, presentations from monster-makers, and an exhibit at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History (MAH) entitled</span><a href="https://www.santacruzmah.org/exhibitions/lost-worlds"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Werewolf Hunters, Jungle Queens, and Space Commandos: The Lost Worlds of Women Comics Artists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

Lagattuta.</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $2 million grant from the </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/articles/us-department-energy-announces-165-million-funding-carbon-utilization"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will support a partnership between UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://kapsar.sites.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecological aquaculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research team and the company </span><a href="https://www.globalgae.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Algae Innovations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to test whether </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spirulina</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> microalgae grown using carbon dioxide captured from power plant emissions could be an effective aquaculture feed ingredient for farm-raised rainbow trout.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project is one of seven nationwide that received a total of $16.5 million in federal funding to advance technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using algae as a carbon sink. Algae can absorb carbon dioxide waste and use it to grow, and the resulting algal biomass can then be turned into animal feed, biofuels, and other useful products.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Algae Innovations will use carbon dioxide captured from flue gas&#8212;the exhaust from combustion power plants&#8212;to grow and process a microalga called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spirulina sp.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while maximizing energy and cost efficiency. Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Pallab Sarker will then test the resulting product to better understand its biochemical characteristics, including nutrients, anti-nutrients, minerals, and trace or heavy metals, compared to conventionally grown </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spirulina</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarker will also add the product to an experimental fish feed formula to see how well rainbow trout can digest the flue gas-grown </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spirulina,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether they like the taste, and how much of the nutrients they absorb versus excrete in their waste, compared to conventionally grown versions of the algae. The ultimate goal of the partnership is to identify ways to fine-tune the production of flue gas-grown </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spirulina</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize its potential as a fish feed ingredient.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have the technology to grow algae inexpensively, and there&#8217;s a lot we can do to change and optimize the biomass, but to do that, we also needed to bring in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s aquaculture experience,&#8221; said Dave Hazlebeck, founder and CEO of Global Algae Innovations. &#8220;This is our first long-term, in-depth testing where we are actually trying to grow algae specifically for fish feed, so it has been a joint venture from the beginning.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazlebeck hopes that flue gas could prove to be an effective and inexpensive source of concentrated carbon dioxide to help scale up the commercial production of <em>Spirulina</em> while more efficient means of capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air are being developed. And if the current experiments are successful, Sarker says that, for rainbow trout, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spirulina</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could potentially become a sustainable, high-performing alternative source of protein to replace conventional fish feed ingredients like wild-caught fish products or terrestrial crops.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe that aquaculture, when done correctly, can provide more environmental benefits than harm,&#8221; Sarker said. &#8220;By working together interdisciplinarily and with industry partners on projects like this, we can offer critical improvements to this rapidly expanding industry, so that commercial fish farms can benefit in the near future.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dc6f542d8072704653a8eb2563a6dc14"><name>new-wifi-service</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New WiFi service for educational and smart devices</title><summary>Information Technology Services (ITS) is pleased to announce a new campus WiFi service for educational and smart devices.</summary><start-date>1695798000000</start-date><display-name>New WiFi service for educational and smart devices</display-name><path>/2023/09/new-wifi-service</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/09/new-wifi-service</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1695915398172</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1695915398172</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Information Technology Services (ITS) is pleased to announce a new campus WiFi service for educational and smart devices.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Campus Community,&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the 2023-24 academic year! I love the rush of energy, anticipation, and enthusiasm that accompanies the start of classes each fall. It is a time of such promise and possibility. Volunteering during Move-in Weekend, seeing our new Slugs arrive often with generations of family in tow, made my heart soar, and it was wonderful to see the huge crowd at Tuesday&#8217;s Cornucopia event. So many smiling faces!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall feels especially energized, as in addition to welcoming new and returning students, we are swinging open the doors to our stunning new Rachel Carson/Oakes College Dining Hall, and unveiling phase one of our Kresge College revitalization and expansion. The new dining facility features a state-of-the-art kitchen and a seating area with sweeping views of the Monterey Bay. The Kresge project includes three new residence halls with beds for 400 students, plus a fantastic new academic building. The project earned a mention in a recent </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/arts/design/architecture-fall-preview.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times round-up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of top-notch architectural makeovers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have even more housing projects in the works. The second and final phase of the Kresge project, which is underway and expected to be finished approximately two years from now, will include another 600 beds. We expect to break ground this spring on a new family-student housing complex and on an early-education center for the young children of students and employees, both near the corner of Hagar and Coolidge drives. That project will be immediately followed by another housing project &#8212; this one on Heller Drive &#8212; that will serve nearly 3,000 upper-division and graduate students!&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, we received some additional good news. A new funding plan announced by the state will allow a housing project we are pursuing in partnership with Cabrillo College to move forward. It will include roughly 250 beds for UC Santa Cruz students and help us strengthen transfer pathways between our institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these projects &#8212; and others we are working on &#8212; will greatly benefit our community. It&#8217;s so exciting to see our hard work on new housing and academic space paying off.&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Slug Support is there when you need it</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now we expect to welcome roughly 5,500 new undergraduates this fall, a mix of first-year and transfer students, plus approximately 620 new graduate students. We are committed to providing all our students access to an unparalleled educational experience and the tools and resources they need to succeed. We are ready to help students who might need extra assistance &#8212; housing, basic needs or overcoming other hurdles they may encounter. Our </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Support Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promotes early intervention to prevent problems from escalating into a crisis. Do not hesitate to reach out.&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Get involved with campus life</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my experience, participating in activities that interest you is essential to getting the most out of your college experience. We offer hundreds of programs, college-based events, academic opportunities, concerts, exhibits, and recreational activities that are available to you as UCSC students, staff and faculty. Check out our </span><a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">events calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Visit our many </span><a href="https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resource centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Investigate our many student clubs, see what&#8217;s happening at your </span><a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/colleges/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">college</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in the </span><a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Division of Student Affairs and Success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You never know what might inspire you, who you might meet, or where your curiosity might lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am so proud of our campus, faculty, staff and students. Over the past year, we have seen so many successes. We opened the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/01/ias-gallery.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Institute of the Arts and Sciences gallery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Researchers with our Baskin School of Engineering released a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/pangenome-draft.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">draft of the first human pangenome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Faculty in Physical and Biological Sciences played key roles in the release of some of the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/exoplanet-images.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first images from the James Webb Space Telescope</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our reputation for creative interdisciplinary exploration across the humanities and social sciences earned us an </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/06/acls-humanities-ucsc-dw.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invitation to the prestigious American Council of Learned Societies Research University Consortium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our Research Center for the Americas celebrated 30 years of groundbreaking work with an official </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/10/dolores-huerta-research-center-naming-event.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renaming for social justice icon Dolores Huerta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a university on an incredible upward trajectory. I am grateful for the contributions to our mission that we get from all corners of our campus, and I cannot wait to see what we accomplish next! Wishing you all a successful, rewarding and meaningful academic year. Go Slugs!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sincerely,<br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cindy</span></p>

<h3>&#160;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimada Comunidad del Campus:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#161;Bienvenidos al a&#241;o acad&#233;mico 2023-24! Yo amo el impulso de energ&#237;a, anticipaci&#243;n, y entusiasmo que acompa&#241;an al comienzo de clases cada oto&#241;o. Es un momento de tantas promesas y posibilidades. Servir de voluntaria durante el Fin de Semana de las Mudanzas de Llegada y ver arribar a nuestros nuevos </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a menudo con generaciones de familiares a la zaga, me aviva el coraz&#243;n, y fue maravilloso ver la inmensa multitud que acudi&#243; al acto de Cornucopia del martes. &#161;Tant&#237;simos rostros risue&#241;os!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Este oto&#241;o se siente especialmente energizado, ya que adem&#225;s de darles la bienvenida a los estudiantes, novatos y los que regresaban, abrimos de par en par las puertas de nuestro nuevo y deslumbrante Comedor del Colegio Rachel Carson/Oakes, y develamos la fase uno de la revitalizaci&#243;n y expansi&#243;n de nuestro Colegio Kresge. El flamante comedor cuenta con una modern&#237;sima cocina y &#225;rea de mesas con vista panor&#225;mica a la Bah&#237;a de Monterey. El proyecto Kresge incluye tres nuevos pabellones de residencia con camas para 400 estudiantes, m&#225;s un fant&#225;stico nuevo edificio acad&#233;mico. El proyecto mereci&#243; una menci&#243;n en un reciente </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/arts/design/architecture-fall-preview.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resumen del New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sobre remodelaciones arquitect&#243;nicas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenemos en camino a&#250;n m&#225;s proyectos de vivienda. Se espera que la segunda y final fase del proyecto Kresge, que ya est&#225; en marcha, quede terminada en aproximadamente un par de a&#241;os, e incluir&#225; otras 600 camas. Esperamos empezar a construir esta primavera un nuevo complejo de viviendas para familias/estudiantes y un centro de ense&#241;anza a temprana edad para los hijos peque&#241;os de los estudiantes y empleados, ambos cercanos a la esquina de Hagar Drive y Coolidge Drive. A ese proyecto de vivienda le seguir&#225; otro &#8212; este en Heller Drive &#8212; que &#161;servir&#225; a casi 3,000 estudiantes de nivel superior y de posgrado!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A principios de este mes, recibimos m&#225;s noticias de las buenas. El estado anunci&#243; un nuevo plan de financiamiento que facilitar&#225; un proyecto de vivienda que estamos contemplando en sociedad con el Colegio Cabrillo, para llevarlo adelante. Este incluir&#225; unas 250 camas para estudiantes de la UC Santa Cruz y nos ayudar&#225; a fortalecer las v&#237;as para los traslados de una instituci&#243;n a otra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Todos estos proyectos &#8212; y otros en los que ya estamos trabajando &#8212; beneficiar&#225;n grandemente a nuestra comunidad. Es tan emocionante ver como nuestra ardua labor en cuanto a nuevas viviendas y espacios acad&#233;micos est&#225;n dando resultado.</span></p>
<h3>El apoyo a los Slugs est&#225; ah&#237; cuando hace falta</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actualmente esperamos darle la bienvenida este oto&#241;o a unos 5,500 estudiantes de bachillerato novatos, una mezcla de novatos y de estudiantes trasladados, m&#225;s aproximadamente 620 nuevos estudiantes de posgrado. Tenemos el compromiso de proporcionar acceso a todos nuestros estudiantes a una experiencia educativa sin paralelos, as&#237; como los instrumentos y recursos que ellos necesitan para triunfar. Estamos listos para ayudar a los estudiantes que pudieran necesitar ayuda &#8212; vivienda, necesidades b&#225;sicas o como superar otros obst&#225;culos que se le presentasen. Nuestro </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programa de Apoyo a los Slugs </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">promociona intervenciones tempranas para prevenir que los problemas escalen a nivel de crisis. No vacile en solicitar.</span></p>
<h3>Invol&#250;crese en la vida del campus/h3&gt;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">En mi experiencia, participar en actividades que le interesen a Uds. es esencial para sacarle el m&#225;ximo a su experiencia en el colegio. Ofrecemos cientos de programas, basados en eventos del colegio, oportunidades acad&#233;micas, conciertos, exhibiciones, y actividades recreativas que est&#225;n disponibles para Uds. como estudiantes, personal y facultad de la UCSC. &#201;chele una mirada a nuestro </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">calendario de eventos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Visite nuestros muchos </span><a href="https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">centros de recursos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Investigue nuestros muchos clubes estudiantiles, vea lo que est&#225; sucediendo en su </span><a href="https://housing.ucsc.edu/colleges/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">colegio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> y en la </span><a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Divisi&#243;n de Asuntos y &#201;xitos Estudiantiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Uds. nunca saben qu&#233; pudiera inspirarlos, a qui&#233;n pudieran conocer, o hasta d&#243;nde pudiera llevarlos su curiosidad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siento mucho orgullo de nuestro campus, facultad, personal y estudiantes. En el transcurso del pasado a&#241;o, hemos visto tantos &#233;xitos. Inauguramos la </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/01/ias-gallery.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">galer&#237;a del Instituto de Artes y Ciencias de la UC Santa Cruz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Los investigadores de nuestra Escuela de Ingenier&#237;a Baskin emitieron un </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/pangenome-draft.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">borrador del primer pangenoma humano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. La facultad de Ciencias F&#237;sicas y Biol&#243;gicas desempe&#241;&#243; un papel clave en la divulgaci&#243;n de algunas de las </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/exoplanet-images.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primeras im&#225;genes del Telescopio Espacial James Webb Space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nuestra reputaci&#243;n en la exploraci&#243;n interdisciplinaria creativa en todas en las humanidades y ciencias sociales nos ha ganado una </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/06/acls-humanities-ucsc-dw.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invitaci&#243;n al prestigioso Consorcio de Investigaciones del Consejo Americano de Sociedades Cient&#237;ficas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nuestro Centro de Investigaciones para Las Am&#233;ricas celebr&#243; 30 a&#241;os de trabajos innovadores con el </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/10/dolores-huerta-research-center-naming-event.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renombramiento oficial de nuestro icono de justicia social Dolores Huerta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somos una universidad que tiene una incre&#237;ble trayectoria ascendente. Agradezco las contribuciones que recibimos para nuestra misi&#243;n desde todos los rincones de nuestro campus, y &#161;apenas puedo esperar a ver nuestros pr&#243;ximos logros! Dese&#225;ndoles a todos Uds. un exitoso, recompensante y significativo a&#241;o acad&#233;mico. &#161;Adelante </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slugs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sept. 21 visit began at the Hay Barn, where UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, and students shared information about USDA-funded research and education projects with special guests from the USDA, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics Sanah Baig</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Program Leader for the Division of Community and Education Dr. Carlos Ortiz</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate Area Director for the Agricultural Research Service Dr. John Dyer</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff Caitlin Balagula&#160;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were really honored to welcome the representatives from the USDA,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacy Philpott, professor of Environmental Studies, faculty director for the Center for Agroecology, and Alfred &amp; Ruth Heller Chair in Agroecology.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;I was blown away by all of the students and faculty who jumped in to tell their stories and by all of the thoughtful questions and insights shared by the USDA staff. It was exciting to revisit all of our accomplishments together and share that with the funders that make our work possible.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philpott and Center for Agroecology Executive Director Darryl Wong shared presentations on USDA-funded workforce development projects focusing on increasing opportunities and support for learners from underrepresented populations to create a more diverse food and agriculture workforce. These projects include a new multi-campus</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/09/usda-organic-agriculture-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UC partnership</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to improve and expand undergraduate education in organic agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a recently-awarded $10 million </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/06/usda-10m-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NextGen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grant to cultivate diverse food and agriculture professionals who are equipped to advance equity in food systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;NextGen is an incredible focus for the USDA and for Secretary (of Agriculture) Vilsack and President Biden,&#8221; Deputy Undersecretary Baig shared. &#8220;We&#8217;re thinking about this as an opportunity for UC Santa Cruz to develop and share best practices with institutions, leaders, faculty, and students all over the country that are aligned in this mission and this vision.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USDA representatives then learned how UC Santa Cruz researchers are working to develop solutions to challenges in the field of agriculture through projects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Colleen Josephson&#8217;s research on </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/04/colleen-ffar-award.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measuring the health of soil microbes using bio-electrochemical systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Marco Rolandi&#8217;s work studying the potential of </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/03/leaf-wetness-sensors.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biomimetic leaf wetness sensors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enable better plant disease management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, the group heard from students involved in research projects spanning from ag tech to agroforestry initiatives in Ethiopia, as well as peer mentors and participants in the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2018/02/superdar.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUPERDAR program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which supports underrepresented students in exploring agriculture-related fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students shared experiences of getting involved with agriculture and food systems through unexpected avenues. &#8220;I was born and raised in Salinas, my mother is a farmer. I never thought I&#8217;d end up learning about robots and technology,&#8221; said Mauricio Chavez, an undergraduate student who is collaborating on a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/06/farm-robotics-challenge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project to develop autonomous tractors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to aid small farmers with weed control. &#8220;I want to make farming better, easier on the body, and more cost efficient, especially for organic growers who spend more time weeding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edith Gonzales, a Ph.D. student who has mentored two SUPERDAR undergraduates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shared how meaningful being a peer mentor has been for her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;As someone who was raised in a farmworker community, it is transformative to learn and work with students sharing similar backgrounds and interests in agroecology,&#8221; she shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Carlos Ortiz shared that he was impressed by the diverse opportunities available to UC Santa Cruz students. &#8220;You do a really good job at exposing students to things they didn&#8217;t know they were interested in, and I commend you for it,&#8221; said Ortiz. &#8220;All these different roles we&#8217;ve heard about today make up agriculture, and there is a place for everyone to take part in it in a way that works for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After final presentations on </span><a href="https://ucanr.edu/News/?routeName=newsstory&amp;postnum=43758"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing non-fumigant soilborne disease management for strawberries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/01/usda-grant-aquaculture.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecological aquaculture research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a new project focused on building a pipeline for </span><a href="https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=99693&amp;format=WEBFMT6NT"><span style="font-weight: 400;">training and recruiting Indigenous students in coastal resilience and seafood safety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the group toured the campus farm. While there, the USDA guests learned about additional food systems research and initiatives UC Santa Cruz is taking part in, including a new USDA </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/regional-food-center.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Regional Food Business Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/09/basic-needs.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic Needs program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The visit concluded with lunch prepared by staff and students from the non-transactional Cowell Coffee Shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Undersecretary Baig shared that she was glad she could observe impactful USDA-funded work being done at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The Department of Agriculture is proud to support UC Santa Cruz across so many different efforts, and we&#8217;re really pleased for the chance to come here and learn about NextGen and workforce development, as well as some of the research in action,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to thank you for having such an inspiring model for community engagement and bringing many students from many disciplines together to recognize the interconnectedness of the work that we do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was incredibly powerful for our staff, faculty, administrators, and especially our students to see the USDA so engaged and interested in the work UCSC is doing and the pathways our students are making in the world,&#8221; Wong reflected. &#8220;As we embark on this new work, it is invaluable to know that we have partners like these in Washington.&#8221;</span></p>

style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers from UC Santa Cruz received a subaward on the newly announced National Science Foundation (NSF)</span><a href="https://www.umass.edu/cbiks"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledges and Science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a five-year, $30 million international </span><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=308168&amp;org=BCS&amp;from=home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NSF Science and Technology Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The center will focus on connecting Indigenous knowledges with mainstream &#8220;Western&#8221; sciences to address complex, evolving challenges brought on by climate change. Those challenges include impacts to land, water, and plant and animal life; the danger posed to irreplaceable archaeological sites, sacred places, and cultural heritage; and changing food systems, all of which disproportionately affect Indigenous communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center will take a transdisciplinary approach to these issues, using community-based research to conduct place-based studies and projects in partnership with 57 Indigenous communities, 29 universities, two tribal colleges, five NGOs, two national museums, and two industry partners. These efforts will be organized around eight regional &#8220;hubs&#8221; across the U.S., Canada, Aotearoa New Zealand, and Australia. And eight thematic working groups will distill key lessons to produce cross-cultural research methodologies and ethics guidelines. The center&#8217;s team of over 50 affiliated scientists includes more than 30 of the world&#8217;s leading Indigenous social scientists, natural scientists, and environmental scientists.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$500,000 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subaward on the project, Associate Professor of Anthropology Tsim Schneider&#8212;an archaeologist and citizen of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria who studies the heritage and resilience of California Indian peoples&#8212;will co-direct the new center&#8217;s &#8220;Relationality&#8221; working group. Schneider and the team will focus on best practices for problem-solving approaches that prioritize Native and Indigenous communities' diverse knowledges without being extractive or transactional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Relationality is one of the things that stands to make this center&#8217;s work so impactful,&#8221; Schneider said. &#8220;It foregrounds the role and value of sustained relationship-building with communities who, for the most part, have been excluded from the decision-making about when and how their cultural and ecological knowledge can be accessed and used and by whom, as well as about who benefits from the work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, UCSC Associate Professor of Anthropology Jon Daehnke will serve as co-director of the new center&#8217;s Pacific Northwest Regional Hub. Daehnke&#8217;s prior work includes an ethnography produced in collaboration with the Chinook Indian Nation and archaeological research of Indigenous peoples&#8217; connection to the land near the Columbia River and Hart Mountain in Oregon. Daehnke will help to administer sub-awards for field-work case-studies and other research in the region and coordinate among projects so that they build upon each other&#8217;s work and lead to meaningful long-term research networks, collaborations, and partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The key to all of this will be funding projects that truly and fully embrace collaboration, that center and are guided by Indigenous concerns, knowledge, and priorities, and which already have a track record demonstrating that they can put their collaborative projects into practice,&#8221; Daehnke said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a national level, the new center also has an important educational mission. Undergraduate, graduate, and community research assistantships and internships will be available in all regional hubs and working groups. The center will also develop formal curriculum materials for college and K-12 levels and informal camps, after-school programs, and museum exhibits. Additional educational efforts will include trainings and workshops for government agencies and museum scientists and a publicly-available knowledge base to share lessons from the center&#8217;s work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sonya Atalay, director of the center and provost professor of anthropology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said that the project ultimately aims to provide mindful, ethical methods for integrating Indigenous and Western sciences and a future workforce of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers who are skilled at applying these approaches to address pressing climate and environmental challenges. She hopes this work &#8220;can help lead to healthier Indigenous futures and new possibilities for science.&#8221;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>

The Sept. 27 event took place on a quintessential warm fall day in the Kresge College courtyard, the stunning architecture coexisting beautifully with the college&#8217;s natural landscape. The new buildings at Kresge are some of the few on campus that are nestled in the redwoods and feature stunning views of Monterey Bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today is such a wonderful celebration,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive in her remarks just before she and Kresge College Provost Mayanthi Fernando cut the ribbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kresge College was built around the idea of community. These new buildings&#8212;the academic space, the residential space, the Owl&#8217;s Nest cafe, the new lounges for the students&#8212;all bring the Kresge community together,&#8221; Larive said. &#8220;But what I&#8217;m most proud of is that the changes don&#8217;t just modernize the architecture, modernize the spaces, and keep true to the spirit of Kresge&#8212;they do so in a way that embeds accessibility. That&#8217;s important so all members of our community can feel at home at Kresge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustainability and accessibility were at the forefront of the project&#8217;s design led by noted architect and MacArthur Fellow Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang Architects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three new residential halls are home to more than 400 moved-in students and feature open spaces and lounges where students can connect and collaborate. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new 35,000-square-foot academic building houses multiple departments and faculty offices, affirming the college as a scholarly space as well as a residential one. The entire campus community will benefit from the building&#8217;s multipurpose classrooms, study lounges, a state-of-the-art computer lab, and a 600-person lecture hall&#8212;the largest on campus&#8212;for events and performances. The remodeled North Bridge, now accessible to people of all abilities, connects Kresge to the rest of the campus and helps facilitate foot traffic to the west side of campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With all the thoughtful decisions that went into the design&#8212;the myriad sustainable design features, student lounges with views of the bay, abundant natural light for the building interiors&#8212;what is perhaps most striking is not what is new but what remains: an ever-evolving educational experiment set within our spectacular natural environment,&#8221; remarked Jolie Kerns, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Director of Physical and Environmental Planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge was founded as an intentional living and learning community with academic and living spaces intertwined. The college&#8217;s original design imagined Kresge&#8217;s students, faculty, and staff reading, eating, and creating together and was designed in close collaboration with students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These founding values&#8212;creativity, sustainability, and collaboration&#8212;continue to resonate at Kresge, and they informed what we see here today: the culmination of the first phase of the Kresge renewal project,&#8221; said Fernando, the college&#8217;s provost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renewal project began in 2016 with a community-generated vision for a dynamic renovation plan that meets the needs of today&#8217;s students while maintaining the original spirit of Kresge College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What an exciting time to be here,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, Lori Kletzer. &#8220;This [Kresge] is a place that will celebrate teaching, that will celebrate learning, celebrate living together in a 21st-century way. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited for this stage for Kresge and then of course thinking a few years down the road when we can reopen all of Kresge College.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second and final phase of the Kresge project, slated to reopen in fall 2025, will restore existing buildings&#8212;adding more space for housing and residential life&#8212;resulting in a total of 970 beds. The treasured Town Hall will be rebuilt on the south end of the college and will once again host concerts, conferences, and other large events including town halls where students will come together to continue to envision the present and future of Kresge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will continue to center the student experience,&#8221; Fernando said. &#8220;The opening of these buildings today continues a long and storied legacy at Kresge of enabling students to live and learn together.&#8221;</span></p>

Dianne Feinstein, a towering figure in the history of both our state and nation. Senator Feinstein trailblazed a path for countless women in politics, working her way from the halls of San Francisco government to the Senate Chamber in the U.S. Capitol, all the while fighting on behalf of the underserved and overlooked. Senator Feinstein was a strong advocate for higher education in general and for the University of California specifically. Her steadfast support for higher education complemented the work done by her late husband, Richard Blum, a longtime member and former chair of the UC Board of Regents. Senator Feinstein was a compassionate, forthright and effective leader, and her positive impact undeniable and extraordinary. My condolences to her family, friends and colleagues. California and the country have lost a great leader.&#8221;</span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f0fd5ecd8072704653a8eb25463bcc0b"><name>fire-and-safety-report</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report</title><summary>The 2023 Annual Campus Security &amp; Fire Safety Report is now available online, in accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act and Higher Education Opportunity Act.&#13;

By joining two units that have been close partners over the past years, the merger officially brings together the expertise of both units to support the campus as it navigates the contemporary instructional landscape and strives to become a learner-centered research university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015, the original vision for CITL called for the new center to &#8220;provide an organizational structure for improvements to teaching and learning.&#8221; In launching this work, the Office of the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs and the Academic Senate Committee on Teaching also foresaw the need for pedagogy support to include technology-enhanced learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today, all instruction is technologically enhanced,&#8221; said Associate Campus Provost for Academic Success and former CITL Founding Director Jody Greene. &#8220;It no longer makes sense to have a separate unit which has most of the instructional design expertise, especially but not only in how to use technology to enhance student learning, and not have that be part of the work we do in the teaching center.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of the partnership between CITL and OE has expanded far beyond the original charge to include redefining access, addressing practices and policies contributing to inequality, prioritizing the call for educational accountability, and forefronting the continuity of instruction.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve watched as this partnership has extended the reach of the teaching and learning center and opened more pathways and connections across campus, demonstrating the necessity of this work and how it can and will transform UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;The Teaching and Learning Center is our future, secured in a foundation that is CITL and Online Education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Greene&#8217;s visionary leadership, student success expanded to bridge the gap between thinking of student success and faculty success as different things, and rather as integral pieces of the same conversation. &#8220;Now we have a much more care-based and science-based approach to learning, and we take a more research and evidence-based approach to teaching,&#8221; Greene said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the merger, Greene stepped down as CITL&#8217;s faculty director after seven years leading the center through the first development phase. They are now the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/07/acp-greene-announcement.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">associate campus provost for academic success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Office of the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor. Robin Dunkin, associate teaching professor in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, is TLC&#8217;s faculty director. Dunkin served as CITL&#8217;s assistant faculty director supporting Greene and partnering with center staff to develop and deliver faculty workshops, the STEM Teaching and Learning Community, Project REAL and New Faculty Teaching Academy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TLC, located on the first floor of McHenry Library, will be an even more comprehensive center better positioned to serve all members of UCSC&#8217;s teaching community with integrated course design and redesign, promoting and assessing student learning, making equity data actionable, and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rethinking</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how to evaluate and reward teaching on campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re changing what it means to teach and learn by looking at how to shape the future of teaching so that faculty have the skills they need, and students have the right sort of experiences and knowledge for using educational technologies so they can thrive,&#8221; said Michael Tassio, assistant vice provost for educational innovation and former director of Online Education.&#160;</span></p>
