<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Finlay&#8212;president of </span><a href="https://www.glynwood.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Glynwood Center for Regional Food and Farming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Hudson Valley and founder of </span><a href="https://www.pleiadesnetwork.org/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pleiades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;has advanced her undergraduate experiences along the Pacific Coast into action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 5, Finlay was one of three female leaders honored at the 20th annual Women in Conservation luncheon, hosted by the National Audubon Society at Bryant Park Grill in Manhattan. </span><a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/audubons-women-conservation-luncheon-honors-susanne-durst-kathleen-finlay-and-laura-odonohue"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Audubon Society&#8217;s event press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the prestigious award recognizes visionary women whose &#8220;dedication, talent and energy have advanced positive environmental change locally and on a global scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As National Audubon CEO Elizabeth Gray shared with the audience, Finlay and her counterparts&#8217; leadership in both sustainable or regenerative farming and toward creating a sustainable future &#8220;embodies the true spirit of the award."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Finlay, that desire for a more sustainable future began when she first came to UCSC&#8217;s campus. She had originally wanted to study physics or &#8220;natural philosophy,&#8221; but her interests soon turned to biology because of the local environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was just being immersed in the campus amongst the redwoods and along the Pacific Ocean, which was formative in deepening my passion around thinking about the world we live in,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sacramento native began taking biology, marine biology and writing courses, and took lessons from the university&#8217;s </span><a href="https://scicom.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Communication Master&#8217;s program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helped compel her to &#8220;communicate what I felt were really important ideas about how we can live in the world more harmoniously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea of writing and thinking of environmental issues was at the core of my inquiry at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finlay had another environment to also expand on her understanding of the natural world: her mother&#8217;s native country of Bermuda. Upon Finlay&#8217;s move to Santa Cruz, her mother returned to Bermuda; upon graduation, Finlay moved to the country as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Bermuda, Finlay volunteered for a number of nonprofits and worked on environmental issues, all while planning to attend graduate school. She soon thereafter moved from the island nation to Boston to attend Boston University, where she focused on science journalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I got my graduate degree, I also realized I didn&#8217;t want to be a science journalist, because I was too opinionated about what I thought could happen,&#8221; she said of the time, often going between Bermuda and Boston. &#8220;I wanted to be on the nonobjective side of a movement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On returning to Bermuda, Finlay then worked for a U.S. Oceanographic Institution based in Bermuda in their communications department. From there, she joined Harvard Medical School&#8217;s Center for Health and Global Environment, eventually becoming a managing director during her 11 year tenure there.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that position, she studied and wrote about the relationship between the ocean and human health, with seafood being one of the primary and important connections.That led Finlay to develop an interest and attraction to using food in ways that &#8220;help people understand how much a part of the natural world we are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Food is a really tangible way that all of us interact with ecosystems&#8212;it is a very fine vehicle for having conversations about our interdependence and connection to the natural world,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finlay took those seedlings to help plant the way to creating a food-centered program at Harvard Medical School, where she remained until 2012. Eventually, Finlay yearned to do something less academic by implementing tangible actions that could lead to better health outcomes for people and the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what inspired her to join the Glynwood Center for Regional Food and Farming, a nonprofit serving food and farming changemakers from its home base in New York&#8217;s Hudson Valley. The organization works to advance local food production, educate a national audience, and promote regenerative agriculture, all in service of the natural environment, local economies, and human health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The center has a demonstration farm which they use for education programming, a residential apprenticeship program, and a market development team for specific food sectors across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Finlay joined the organization 11 years ago, the center has tripled the scale of its work, while also evolving to address food justice, food sovereignty and food equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You know, 11 years ago, the kind of food that we think is a basic human right&#8212;healthy, beautifully produced, culturally appropriate&#8212;was celebrated as something that was for the elite or well-resourced folks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re really trying to shift that paradigm, to acknowledge that we all deserve dignified food.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back to her time on the West Coast among the redwoods, Finlay believes that there are aspects of her UC Santa Cruz education that directly relate to her current work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just the privilege of walking amongst those trees has stayed with me&#8212;it was a culture that truly acknowledged the natural beauty around us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Those experiences were incredibly formative.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, she said, her lifelong friends and mentorships made the experience of being a Slug all the more imperative to her current work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those relationships I started at UCSC that I treasure, that are really loving, respectful and caring, I have to think that the overall culture of the university gets some credit.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bd74ef0c8072704638487124f3d7823d"><name>biopharmaceutical-industry-governance</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Student-supported global research compares regional relationships with Big Pharma</title><summary>Recent UC Santa Cruz graduates helped to author a study on the strategies governments use to attract and manage the biopharmaceutical industry, focusing in particular on the different types of economic value and health value that these efforts provide, or fail to provide, to citizens.&#13;

<p><a href="https://gch.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global &amp; Community Health Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Executive Vice Director Matt Sparke led the research team in comparing biopharmaceutical hubs in California, Puerto Rico, China, Singapore, and South Africa. The article&#8217;s findings detail the varying strategies that governments use to attract and manage the industry, focusing in particular on the different types of economic value and health value that these efforts provide, or fail to provide, to citizens.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malmberg, who majored in sociology, first got involved with the project through the Institute for Social Transformation&#8217;s </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/funding/building-belonging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Belonging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, which provides fellowship funding for undergraduates to work alongside faculty on research projects. As a transfer student, she said the program helped her to make the most out of her time on campus. She also enjoyed bringing her Spanish-language skills to the team and realized that she&#8217;d like to continue doing research as she pursues a career in public health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This research experience has given me a new lens on how to go into my professional life,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was fun in a way that I was not expecting. Some of the types of information that we were looking for about these biopharmaceutical companies are not straightforward to find and make sense of, so it was a bit of a puzzle and a challenge that we had to overcome.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparke said the research team&#8217;s work comparing governance models for the biopharmaceutical industry was all the more important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which demonstrated vast inequities in access to vaccines and other medications around the globe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People in the Global South have always been very familiar with unequal access to medicines, and we also experience it to some degree within our population here in the United States,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It remains a huge problem, and most governments have found themselves very weakly positioned in relation to Big Pharma. They therefore often tend to be price takers, rather than price makers.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, for example, the paper explains that governments provide public funding, infrastructure, and tax incentives to support the development of biopharmaceutical hubs, and the industry then helps contribute to regional economic growth. But the research team argues that these policies also turn public resources into private profits, creating corporate monopolies that reduce the affordability and accessibility of medications for populations both locally and globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countries like China and Singapore take different approaches that aim to capture increased health benefits alongside the economic value of biopharmaceutical innovation, the paper shows. It details how China&#8217;s policies focus partly on domestic procurement and production of medicines to support biosecurity goals. And Singapore encourages companies to tailor medicines to the needs of the local population by hosting clinical trials and serving as an experimental frontier. However, biomedical development is still primarily market-based under both models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, South Africa&#8217;s public healthcare system provides antiretroviral drugs to citizens for AIDS treatment, and the paper discusses how the government&#8217;s role in purchasing such medications relates to its efforts to regulate monopoly pricing. South Africa also promotes domestic production of essential medicines and is working toward state production of active pharmaceutical ingredients. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization picked Cape Town, South Africa, to serve as a new mRNA vaccine hub, with the goal of both producing medications and sharing technology throughout the Global South.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper argues that the new Cape Town mRNA hub, in particular, shows how a different type of governance of the biopharmaceutical industry is possible. The researchers also shared some evidence of changes that might be coming to the United States. For example, the paper discusses how medicare price caps and other recent federal policies, along with efforts by the state of California to produce its own insulin, successfully pressured the biopharmaceutical industry to lower costs of the medication.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those efforts have made great progress in pushing down the prices on insulin, and this is a lifesaving transformation,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;People were rationing supplies because they couldn&#8217;t afford the amount of medicine that they needed, and some people were dying as a result. Now, that&#8217;s going to change. This is a huge policy achievement, not least of all here in California, that really should be more widely acknowledged.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For undergraduate student coauthor Ted Malpass, studying this success story was one of the most exciting aspects of the research. Malpass, who recently graduated with a degree in politics, is a type 1 diabetic and has sometimes struggled to afford insulin. Those experiences inspired him to found a chapter of Universities Allied for Universal Medicines (UAEM) at UC Santa Cruz and to join the research team working on the article.

A proponent of hands-on learning, Hein chose oceanography where fieldwork would be more easily accessible. This decision shaped a career that took him to the depths of the ocean floor and to 75 countries around the globe.</p>
<p>His lifelong research is as vast as the oceans he explored. His Ph.D. thesis, using ground-breaking sedimentology techniques to study plate tectonics, was published in top geophysical research publications and caught the attention of the United State Geological Survey, where he was recruited and worked for 45 years. He became internationally renowned for his work in interdisciplinary research in geology, oceanography, geochemistry, and mineral deposits.</p>
<p>Now retired, Hein is acutely aware of the need for the next generation of scientists to continue deep-ocean exploration, as current research is influencing green energy, land resilience, and climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still so much we need to learn about the ocean, and there are not enough scientists. UC Santa Cruz needs to keep providing brilliant researchers,&#8221; said Hein, who was a Teaching Assistant during his doctoral program and taught courses at UCSC throughout his career.</p>
<p>One way he is ensuring the pipeline of scientists continues is by establishing an endowment to support Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) students who are focused on blue water (deep ocean) research.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;I had Ph.D. students who utilized funds from other endowments to attend conferences or participate in research that was of great value to their careers. I want to ensure that others had those same opportunities,&#8221; Hein said.</p>
<p>Hein&#8217;s career was shaped by the experiences and the people he collaborated with at UC Santa Cruz. One of his graduate courses was instrumental in developing unique skills that effectuated his global reputation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They invited world-famous field geologists to teach this particular course. Each geologist took us on field excursions that related to their area of expertise. They took us to the Rocky Mountains to look at thrust faulting, to the Sierra Nevada to study batholiths, and a large selection of other key geological sections. &#8220;The skills I learned enabled me to become one of only a few people in the world that did both land-based and deep-ocean geological research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on this global experience in land and off-shore geology, Hein brought several hundred international researchers from both practices together in a program he designed for the International Geological Correlations Program; he led the program for 15 years. In addition, he represented the United States Department of State as its chief scientific advisor to the International Seabed Authority, comprised of 168 Member States and the EU, and participated in the Council and Assembly meetings in Jamaica for 17 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a fascinating career, but I couldn&#8217;t have done it without collaborations, connections and curiosity,&#8221; said Hein. &#8220;The people at Santa Cruz were brilliant thinkers, and the classes were amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>His insatiable curiosity and fervor for data led to authoring and co-authoring more than 700 papers and abstracts. He encourages current EPS majors to stay curious, become lifelong learners, keep their connections open, and become expert writers.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Connections and collaborations are key in this field,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But curiosity will propel you forward. I value education and like learning and using data to understand what nature is doing. I&#8217;ve been one of the luckiest people in the world to be able to work with amazing colleagues and scientists all over the world. I hope this endowment will open doors for the next generation to collaborate, connect, and expand their curiosity and knowledge.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d13f9ab1807270466941120ec5cff9b0"><name>treehouse-mccabes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>A childhood cancer survivor becomes a cancer researcher </title><summary>This summer, 15-year-old Robert McCabe helped to sequence and analyze a tumor sample in the lab of the UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative.&#13;

He is also a pediatric cancer survivor, and most recently, a pediatric cancer researcher. This summer, he helped to sequence and analyze a tumor sample in the lab of the UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative.<br/><br/>In late July, Robert joined his older sister, Molly (Cowell &#8217;22, molecular, cellular and developmental biology), a junior researcher in Associate Professor of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology Olena Vaske&#8217;s lab, on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Vaske leads the Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative with the goal of leveraging genomics to improve the outcomes for pediatric cancer patients. The siblings helped develop Treehouse&#8217;s ability to sequence tumor specimens at the Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory using the lab&#8217;s new DNA sequencer.<br/><br/>The McCabe family has been deeply impacted by cancer. Robert was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a form of pediatric brain cancer, when he was three years old. Treatment involving emergency brain surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and growth hormones led to Robert&#8217;s recovery, but unfortunately, that was not where the family&#8217;s story with cancer ended.&#160;<br/><br/>Molly and Robert&#8217;s mother passed away from melanoma when Robert was just six and Molly was 13, and Robert was later diagnosed with thyroid cancer, likely from the radiation treatment for medulloblastoma. After treatment that involved a surgery that partially paralyzed his vocal chords, Robert is now in remission.<br/><br/>These experiences inspired Molly to get involved with cancer research while she was an undergraduate student at UCSC. She first worked with Vaske on a project at Blaze Bioscience focusing on tumor paint, an innovative technique to help doctors identify brain tumors during surgery, then later helped with the COVID-19 diagnostics lab, which Treehouse helped establish along with other UCSC colleagues during the pandemic. After the COVID-19 lab completed its mission, she stayed on with Treehouse to help develop in-house RNA sequencing protocols for human tumors &#8212; how to prepare samples for sequencing by creating what are called &#8220;libraries&#8221; from the tumor RNA, and how to do the sequencing itself.<br/><br/>Since it was established in 2013, Treehouse has focused on leveraging their bioinformatics expertise to analyze pediatric cancer RNA sequencing data. RNA data tells the scientists which genes within the DNA are expressed, or &#8220;turned on.&#8221; In studying RNA data, the Treehouse researchers&#160; look for abnormal gene expression, which doctors can potentially use to diagnose or target with medication. Studying RNA has been shown to be an effective strategy for understanding childhood cancers specifically, as childhood cancers are less likely to be a result of the buildup of DNA mutations that occur throughout a lifetime to cause many adult cancers.<br/><br/><strong>Sequencing real tumors</strong><br/><br/>In the past, the Treehouse Initiative has worked solely with sequencing data produced by other institutions, collaborating with partners such as Stanford Medicine. But over the past year or so, Molly has been working with Treehouse Lab Manager Anouk van den Bout to set up a wet lab protocol that will enable the researchers to work directly with tumor samples to extract and then analyze the RNA sequencing data themselves. In collaboration with UCSF Associate Professor Patrick Devine, Treehouse is working on getting a CLIA license for the Colligan Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory, which will allow them to offer RNA sequencing assays to more patients.<br/><br/>Robert and Molly helped Treehouse develop capabilities to sequence real human tumors. They worked on a tumor sample from a child with a rare cancer who is currently out of treatment options.&#160;<br/><br/>Treehouse offers research analysis for such children as part of collaborations with pediatric cancer hospitals. In several cases, Treehouse's RNA-based findings have been used to guide treatment and even to contribute to disease remission. Molly, Robert, and the Treehouse team are hoping for a similar outcome for this patient.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s so inspirational to hear your story and have you here,&#8221; Vaske said to Robert in a lab meeting, which members from the McCabe family attended to learn more about the project. &#8220;This is the reason we&#8217;re doing this work. We want to have a cure for every child&#8217;s cancer, and have cures that don&#8217;t produce side effects.&#8221;<br/><br/>During their week together in the lab, the siblings worked with Van den Bout to extract RNA from a flash-frozen tumor sample and lung tissue sample, which they then turned into libraries to be sequenced. The process of breaking open the tumor sample to extract the RNA proved difficult, but they were ultimately successful.<br/><br/>&#8220;I was mostly working with pipettes, so I got to do the measuring and sometimes actually used them, and that was pretty fun,&#8221; Robert said.<br/><br/>&#8220;Robert was catching on so quickly,&#8221; Molly said. &#8220;He was doing math and asking questions that it took me months to start asking. I was so impressed.&#8221;<br/><br/>Once the libraries are sequenced, Molly and Robert will work with the bioinformatics experts in the lab to identify genes that may be under- or overexpressed and could be the target of a drug therapy. The sibling team hopes to see the project through and participate in the meetings during which the researchers go through the bioinformatic analyses.&#160;<br/><br/>After this project is complete, Molly plans to return to Alaska and later pursue medical school to one day be a pediatric oncologist working directly with kids with cancer and their families, helping them to navigate the process that her family went through. But for the time being, this project was the &#8220;cherry on top,&#8221; of her time at UCSC, a deeply meaningful full-circle moment.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;When we were vortexing the tumor sample to lyse the tissue for the RNA extraction,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Robert asked me, &#8216;Is this what they did with my brain tumor sample?&#8217; It was a really humbling question &#8212; they probably did.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d59ca2a6807270466941120ef4966cae"><name>inmemoriam-salman-tehrani</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Brandon Salman-Tehrani</title><summary>Brandon Salman-Tehrani passed away on Friday, May 19, 2023.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a steadfast commitment to excellence, inclusivity, and diversity, UC Santa Cruz employs a holistic approach to recruit, evaluate, and support applicants throughout the decision-making journey. The campus is dedicated to fostering equity and promoting excellence in higher education, and embraces holistic application review as a means to admit a diverse student body that will thrive and enrich its vibrant academic community.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Academic excellence and diversity</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The admitted cohort of first-year and transfer students stands out for its remarkable academic achievements, boasting a mean weighted high school GPA of 4.01 and a mean transfer college GPA of 3.48. Among these exceptional students, approximately 34 percent will be the first in their families to attend a university, a 27 percent increase over last year's admitted cohort, and 37 percent are from low income families. UC Santa Cruz extended admissions offers to 1,723 African American high school and transfer students from California, 11,206 Chicanx/Latinx California high school and transfer students, and 304 American Indian high school and transfer students from California.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The campus extended offers of admission to 35 percent more students from underrepresented groups this year than last year, including 33 percent more Black students, 65 percent more American Indian and Alaskan Native students, and 34 percent more Chicanx/Latinx students.&#160;</p>
<h3><strong>California students at the forefront</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campus&#8217;s commitment to serving California students remains a top priority, and UC Santa Cruz has extended offers of admission to 33,128 California high school seniors and 6,727 transfer students from California community colleges. This dedication to providing access to a high-quality and affordable education ensures that the campus community remains diverse and inclusive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We are proud to serve as a destination for transfer and first-year California students seeking a transformative educational experience," said Michelle Whittingham, Associate Vice Chancellor for Enrollment. "Our ongoing outreach and recruitment efforts in high schools and community colleges have resulted in increased interest from talented scholars across the state. The resilience, perseverance and passion of our applicants and admitted students continues to impress me each year.&#8221; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to maximize access to a quality experience for California students, the campus for the first time made several hundred first-year admission offers for winter quarter when additional campus housing capacity will become available because of December graduations. &#8220;While we have historically brought in transfer students in January, we are very excited to ensure a quality winter start for first-year students as well,&#8221; Whittingham said.</span></p>

T2I generative AI can create convincingly realistic photos and videos which are being used more and more for a multitude of purposes, from art to political campaigning.&#160;<br/><br/>However, the algorithmic models that power these tools are trained on data from humans, and can replicate human biases in the images they produce, such as biases around gender and skin tone. These biases can harm marginalized populations, reinforcing stereotypes and potentially leading to discrimination.&#160;<br/><br/>To address these implicit biases, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Xin (Eric) Wang and a team of researchers from Baskin Engineering at UC Santa Cruz created a tool called the Text to Image Association Test, which provides a quantitative measurement of complex human biases embedded in T2I models, evaluating biases across dimensions such as gender, race, career, and religion. They used this tool to identify and quantify bias in the state-of-the-art generative model Stable Diffusion.&#160;<br/><br/>The tool is detailed in <a href="https://t.co/VN7yeSJjaP">a paper</a> for the 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference, a premier computer science conference, and is available for use in a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/Jialu/T2IAT">demo version</a>.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I think both the model owners and users care about this issue,&#8221; said Jialu Wang, a UCSC computer science and engineering Ph.D. student and the first author on the paper. &#8220;If the user is from an unprivileged group, they may not want to see just the privileged group reflected in the images they generate.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>To use the tool, a user must tell the model to produce an image for a neutral prompt, for example &#8220;child studying science.&#8221; Next, the user inputs gender specific prompts, such as &#8220;girl studying science&#8221; and &#8220;boy studying science.&#8221; Then, the tool calculates the distance between the images generated with the neutral prompt and each of the specific prompts. That difference between those two distances is a quantitative measurement of bias.&#160;<br/><br/>Using their tool, the research team found that the state-of-the-art generative model Stable Diffusion both replicates and amplifies human biases in the images it produces. The tool tests the association between two concepts, such as science and arts, to two attributes, such as male and female. It then gives an association score between the concept and the attribute and a value to indicate how confident the tool is in that score.<br/><br/>The team used their tool to test whether the model associates six sets of opposing concepts with positive or negative attributes. The concepts they tested were: flowers and insects, musical instruments and weapons, European American and African American, light skin and dark skin, straight and gay, and Judaism and Christianity. For the most part, the model made associations along stereotypical patterns. However, the model associated dark skin as pleasant and light skin as unpleasant, which surprised researchers as one of the few results in opposition to common stereotypes.<br/><br/>Additionally, they found that the model associated science more closely with males and art more closely with females, and associated careers more closely with males and family more closely with females.<br/><br/>In the past, techniques for evaluating bias in T2I models required researchers to annotate results received from the models when entering a neutral prompt. For example, a researcher might enter a gender neutral prompt such as &#8220;child studying science&#8221; and label whether the model produces images of boys versus girls. But the labor that goes into this annotation process is costly and could potentially be inaccurate, and is often constricted to just gender biases.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We want to get rid of this human annotating process and propose an automatic tool to evaluate those biases, without the tedious laboring,&#8221; Xin Wang said.<br/><br/>Additionally, unlike others, the UCSC team&#8217;s bias evaluation tool considers aspects of the background of the image such as the colors and warmth.<br/><br/>The researchers based their tool on the Implicit Association Test, a well-known test in social psychology used for evaluating human biases and stereotypes. This test evaluates how closely people associate concepts such as &#8220;doctors&#8221; or &#8220;family&#8221; with attributes such as &#8220;men&#8221; or &#8220;women.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Beyond evaluating and analyzing biases in existing tools such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, the team envisions that the tool will allow software engineers to get more accurate measurements of biases in their models while in the development phase and track their efforts to address those biases.<br/><br/>&#8220;With a quantitative measurement, people can work on mitigating those biases and use our tool to quantify their progress in doing so,&#8221; Xin Wang said.<br/><br/>The team said they received plenty of positive feedback from other researchers when presenting this work at the ACL conference.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Many in the community showed a great interest in this work,&#8221; Xin Wang said. &#8220;Some researchers immediately shared this work within their groups and asked me for the details.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Going forward, the team plans to propose suggested methods to mitigate these biases, both in training new models from scratch, or to de-bias existing models during fine-tuning.&#160;<br/><br/>Researchers involved in this project also include undergraduate student Xinyue Gabby Liu, Ph.D. student Zonglin Di, and Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Yang Liu.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f5d789f780727046673f4f97634297d0"><name>new-mena-minor-story-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> UC Santa Cruz launches new Middle Eastern and North African Studies Minor </title><summary>Starting this fall,  a new interdisciplinary minor in Middle Eastern and North African Studies will immerse undergraduates in the region’s languages, culture, politics and history.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of History Jennifer Derr </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has noticed a consistent push for courses about the Middle East and North Africa over the past ten years, as well as a strong demand for language courses focusing on those areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Courses about the region are usually packed with enthusiastic students,&#8221; said Derr, who started teaching at UC Santa Cruz in 2012. &#8220;In the time since I've been here, there has been consistent student interest in building more formal programs that center Southwest Asia &#8211; the Middle East &#8211; and North Africa. This is a tremendous opportunity to respond to that energy and build an academic community of students from different departments in order to enhance their education.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an exciting moment,&#8221; Derr said, referring to the imminent launch of the minor. &#8220;The minor will highlight the breadth and strength of faculty research across different departments to give students the courses and the educational opportunities that they have been asking for.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derr, Founding Director of the </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/centers/middle-east-and-north-africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center For The Middle East And North Africa (CMENA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which launched in 2019, said that pursuing this minor can help students explore the synergies between their primary fields of interest and secondary subjects.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, that sense of openness can influence career decisions, said Derr, noting that she pursued a major in biological sciences during her undergraduate years at Stanford, with a minor in history, before going on to study history in graduate school, also at Stanford.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derr is the author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lived Nile: Environment, Disease And Material Colonial Economy In Egypt (</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanford University Press.) She is the recipient of the National Science Foundation Early Career Award and a $225,000 Andrew W. Mellon Foundation humanities grant </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">supporting &#8220;Race, Empire, and the Environments of Biomedicine,&#8221; a Sawyer Seminar on the Comparative Study of Culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MENA minor also reflects the campus&#8217;s longstanding commitment to top-notch research and scholarship focusing on the Middle East and North Africa, said Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder. &#8220;When it comes to research and scholarship focused on those regions, particularly North Africa, we are one of the leading universities in the UC system and in the United States,&#8221; Alinder said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also committed to developing new pathways in undergraduate and graduate education and professional development,&#8221; Alinder said. &#8220;For our students, equity necessitates opening the globe and expanding horizons of imagination and possibility, as well as supporting the acquisition of tangible and useful skills, which the MENA minor will give them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMENA is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a project of </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute at UCSC (THI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which is housed in the Humanities Division. CMENA&#160; is a hub for academic research, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and public engagement. Affiliated scholars study politics, economics, race, law, the environment, film, literature, linguistics, archeology, the digital humanities, and the histories of science and medicine.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new MENA minor will also provide strong institutional support for undergraduates who are already taking classes focusing on the Middle East and North Africa, while encouraging other students to delve into the region&#8217;s history and culture, Derr said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the state of California is home to historic and sizable communities with roots in the Middle East and North Africa, the minor will also give students a richer understanding of the diverse histories of Californians.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minor, which will be housed in the Humanities Division, has a strong interdisciplinary focus. Affiliated faculty include Derr, Muriam Haleh Davis, Alma Heckman, and Elaine Sullivan (all in History), as well as Martin Devecka (Literature), Camilo Gomez-Rivas (Literature), Jennifer Mogannam (Critical Race and Ethnic Studies), Yasmeen Daifallah (Politics), Thomas Serres (Politics), Ashwak Hauter (Anthropology), Maria Evangelatou (History of Art and Visual Culture), and Peter Limbrick (Film and Digital Media).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This minor will be one of a small number of programs at UCSC that build foreign languages into the curriculum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To complete the minor, students will have to complete at least three quarters of a Middle Eastern language. UCSC offers classes in Arabic, Farsi, and Hebrew. In addition, students must take minor-affiliated courses in at least three different departments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Giving students an incentive to study language is one way of helping them graduate with tangible skills, especially because language study is integrated into a curriculum that also includes the history, politics and culture of the region,&#8221; Derr said.&#160;</span></p>

Her outstanding dedication to bridging the diversity gap in tech through developing free, virtual STEM education programming and hosting inclusive hackathons has led to global recognition with Lee being named<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://top.mlh.io/2023">one of 50 top hackers of 2023</a><span>&#160;</span>by Major League Hacking (MLH).</p>
<p>Each year, MLH, the official student hackathon league and the largest global early-career developer community, selects 50 hackers from a pool of over 150,000 active community members worldwide for their outstanding contributions to the tech community. Lee is the second Baskin Engineering student selected into MLH&#8217;s top 50 list in two consecutive years.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The MLH Top 50 spotlights the unique stories and meaningful contributions of hackers within our community,&#8221; said Mike Swift, CEO of MLH, in<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://top.mlh.io/about">his note announcing this year&#8217;s top 50</a>. &#8220;Members of the MLH Top 50 have a broad variety of backgrounds, experiences, and stories, but each makes our community stronger.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A knack for technology</strong></p>
<p>Growing up, Lee was drawn to technological ideas and concepts and would often ask her dad, an engineer, questions while he worked from home. Her first exposure to tech education was in the sixth grade when she participated in a Google-sponsored mentorship program called More Active Girls In Computing (MAGIC) that matches female and non-binary middle and high school students to female industry mentors.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really enjoyed that all female and non-binary environment because it made me feel like I belonged in tech,&#8221; Lee said of the program.</p>
<p>After being introduced to Python programming through MAGIC, Lee was inspired to continue coding. Self-motivated to learn, she established a strong knowledge base in coding by watching online tutorials. In high school, she completed computer science and cybersecurity courses and pursued extracurricular programs that allowed her to further develop her technical skills.</p>
<p>One of the programs Lee participated in was the AI4ALL summer program, where she was introduced to the field of artificial intelligence and its applications. While there, she learned that many of the other attendees did not have access to computer science education programs at their high schools. Lee, who attributed much of her success and passion for tech to the programs her school district offered, became determined to find a way to deliver tech education to all students despite their location.</p>
<p><strong>Making an impact in the tech community</strong></p>
<p>Lee went on to found<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://citro.tech/">Citro Tech</a>, an online organization dedicated to making computer science education accessible to students worldwide and inspiring more students to pursue STEM education and careers. Lee and her Citro Tech team provide free tech education content, workshops, and hackathons, reaching an online community of more than 100,000 students across 85 countries.&#160;</p>

</figure>
<p>She first learned about MLH when searching for resources and support for organizing Citro Hacks, Citro Tech&#8217;s virtual hackathon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I joined MLH during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;Although everything was virtual, I found the community to be very supportive and welcoming, and it was through MLH I was given the tools needed to run my own successful hackathon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s impact through technology doesn&#8217;t stop with Citro Tech, though. She recently created an educational music therapy app called<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://github.com/namarilee/PocketStory">PocketStory</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As someone who attended and benefited very much from music therapy lessons as a child, I wanted to find a fun and engaging way to make music therapy accessible to all children,&#8221; Lee explained. &#8220;I used my childhood experiences and love for music as inspiration to drive the creation of PocketStory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee taught herself Apple iOS application development and worked with two close friends on the visual design, digital illustrations, and composition of the music.</p>
<p>In 2022, she was awarded a Gold Award, the highest award you can receive from the Girl Scouts organization, for her work on PocketStory. She plans to publish an updated version of the app to the Apple store soon.</p>

<p><strong>Building belonging</strong></p>
<p>At Baskin Engineering, Lee has found a strong community of fellow designers, hackers, and female engineers. She enjoys the diversity and the many opportunities and programs available for students to exercise their technical creativity.</p>
<p>In her first year at UCSC, she participated in CruzHacks, where she built a platform with her friends called SlugShop that promotes UCSC student-run businesses, and joined the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://creativetechdesign.soe.ucsc.edu/">Creative Tech Design club</a><span>&#160;</span>and the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/">Tech4Good Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next few years at Baskin Engineering, she hopes to continue participating in and leading projects with real-world impact, including finding new ways to support STEM education in the K&#8211;12 space. She also hopes to help organize and lead on-campus hackathons, inspiring more students&#8212;especially those who have been historically underrepresented in STEM&#8212;to get involved.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I try to remind those who face impostor syndrome that everyone starts as a beginner, and if you&#8217;re looking to learn new coding skills and meet like-minded people, hackathons are the place to go,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;For anyone interested in participating in hackathons but are intimidated to take that first step, try signing up with a group of friends. I promise, once you put yourself out there, you will not be disappointed.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fac3caf380727046673f4f971dee30f3"><name>open-data-science</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Marine scientists explore the future of open data science</title><summary>Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences considers open science to be a vital part of their academic career and a key way to make the field of marine science more transparent and inclusive.

The Biden-Harris administration, NASA, NOAA and several other US Government agencies declared 2023 the Year of Open Science. Alexa Fredston, an assistant professor of ocean sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz and Julia Stewart Lowndes, a marine data scientist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis of the University of California, Santa Barbara, both consider open science to be a vital part of their academic careers and a key way to make the field of marine science more transparent and inclusive. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published an article in the journal Annual Review of Marine Science about improving open data science practices within marine science.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a marine ecologist, but I write code all day,&#8221; said Fredston. She uses large data sets and models to understand human impacts on the oceans. Like many other researchers trying to answer large-scale questions, Fredston spends much of her time deciding which data sets to use and how to process them. The amount of data available through open science is exciting, she says, but it can also become overwhelming and requires new skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Twenty or 30 years ago, if you were doing a PhD project on glacier ice, you would probably go to a glacier, take some measurements, write that up, and that would be your dissertation,&#8221; said Fredston. &#8220;Now, you'll still go to the glacier and take some measurements, but then you're expected to put that in the context of global climate models and historical precipitation. And all of a sudden, you're pulling climate data from a server somewhere in one format. You're dealing with data on precipitation or sea surface temperature in a different format, and that's really where we think a lot of people struggle.&#8221; To encourage high-quality science that takes advantage of and contributes to open science, Fredston and Stewart Lowndes make several suggestions about where to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They recommend that expert working groups create guides for choosing appropriate datasets. They encourage paid time for learning new skills, including coding. They also suggest that academic incentives should change. Institutions tend to reward journal articles over other types of publications and contributions to science, such as software packages and databases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way that academic tenure and promotion happens has been revised many times in academic history, and there's no reason why it couldn't be broad enough to recognize those kinds of contributions,&#8221; said Fredston.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers also point to an increase in open-access articles and pre-prints that eventually link to the final, peer-reviewed version. For-profit journals are having to shift their models towards open access to accommodate recent mandates in Europe and the United States that state and taxpayer-funded research must be published open access within the next few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to fully take advantage of the huge amounts of open science data available, the researchers state that journals should also rethink their emphasis on novelty. Currently, they favor papers with unprecedented results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There's nothing wrong with celebrating new exciting results as they come out,&#8221; said Fredston. &#8220;But we don't have a great system for rewarding going back to papers and saying, &#8216;Was this result really accurate? If we do it with 100 times as much data, does it still hold up?&#8217; Often, the answer is no.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers also address where the data that researchers use comes from. Popular apps like iNaturalist and eBird provide huge amounts of reliable information from the public about species distribution and human impacts. These apps have been slower coming to the oceans since people don&#8217;t spend as much time there, Fredston says. But the public is beginning to use them in marine environments more often.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to better science, the researchers say open science practices have the potential to create a more inclusive environment that supports diversity and collaboration. Fredston is considering these points as she starts her own lab at UC Santa Cruz. She says she will focus on helping students build data science skills and learn to code in an approachable way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t ever want them to feel like one person alone in an office,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What excites me the most about the future of open science is the ability to work on really big, interdisciplinary, collaborative teams.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="facc71a780727046673f4f976878b83f"><name>maria-gaspar-opening</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz’s Institute of the Arts and Sciences presents West Coast Premiere of Maria Gaspar: Compositions </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz’s Institute of the Arts and Sciences, is opening a new exhibition beginning on September 26, 2023 that goes through March 3, 2024.

Entitled <strong><em>Maria Gaspar: Compositions</em></strong>, it is the first West Coast solo exhibition by the Chicago-based, Guggenheim-winning artist. Bringing together newly commissioned and existing artworks engaging the demolition of a wing of the Cook County Department of Corrections, the largest single-site jail in the United States, <em>Compositions</em> forms complex questions of how debris from the jail&#8217;s destruction might, through collaboration and social transformation, become the building material for a liberated world. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>&#8220;<em>Compositions</em> introduces our audiences to existing artwork by this important, award-winning artist, and also a new, major series of sculpture created for Visualizing Abolition, our thematic programming on prisons and abolition,&#8221; explains Dr. Rachel Nelson<strong>,</strong> director of the Institute and co-curator of the exhibition. &#8220;Asked to think about the relationship between art and prison activism, Maria has offered us aesthetically rich acts of alchemy, transfiguring materials that were made to confine &#8211; like iron prison bars and concrete walls &#8211; into that which can create a new, more just society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>With large-scale sculptures of demolition equipment, delicate hole-strewn works-on-paper, a 60-hour time-lapse video of the bulldozing of the Cook County Jail building, paintings of a cloud-filled sky, and other works, <em>Compositions</em> offers an immersive environment in which to reflect &#8211; and act &#8211; on the artist&#8217;s provocations. The exhibition is accompanied by a selection of short films developed through the artist&#8217;s collaborations with people incarcerated. Throughout the exhibition&#8217;s duration, sculptural renderings of the jail&#8217;s fragments will be sonically and visually activated through performances. <br/><br/>The acclaimed composer and theorist</span> <a href="https://music.ucsc.edu/people/james-gordon-williams"><span>James Gordon Williams</span></a><span>, assistant professor of music at UC Santa Cruz, will perform an improvised musical piece using the jail&#8217;s iron bars on October 7, 2023, 4-5:30 p.m. and the artist will speak about her practice. Workshops with the artist will also be held, with dates TBA.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Also on view at the Institute is <em>Sadie Barnette: Family Business, </em>a multi-sited exhibition organized with the San Jos&#233; Museum of Art (SJMA) that explores the artist&#8217;s family history to reveal the personal&#8212;and shared&#8212;experience of Black repression and resistance in the United States. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span>Maria Gaspar: Compositions</span></em><span> and <em>Sadie Barnette: Family Business </em>are part of the major public scholarship program, Visualizing Abolition, an ongoing initiative exploring art, prisons, and justice. Visualizing Abolition highlights the creative work underway by artists, activists, and scholars to imagine alternatives to current injustices. Visualizing Abolition is organized by UC Santa Cruz Professor Gina Dent and Dr. Rachel Nelson, in partnership with Lauren Schell Dickens, San Jos&#233; Museum of Art chief curator.</span></p>

Now, this elusive area of the genome has been fully sequenced, a feat that finally completes the set of end-to-end human chromosomes and adds 30 million new bases to the human genome reference, mostly from challenging-to-sequence satellite DNA. These bases reveal 41 additional protein-coding genes, and provide crucial insight for those studying important questions related to reproduction, evolution, and population change. <br/><br/>Researchers from the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium, which is co-led by University of California, Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Karen Miga, announced this achievement in a paper published today in the journal Nature. The complete, annotated Y chromosome reference is available for use on the UCSC Genome Browser and can be accessed via Github. <br/><br/>&#8220;Just a few years ago, half of the human Y chromosome was missing [from the reference] &#8212; the challenging, complex satellite areas,&#8221; said Monika Cechova, co-lead author on the paper and postdoctoral scholar in biomolecular engineering at UCSC. &#8220;Back then we didn&#8217;t even know if it could be sequenced, it was so puzzling. This is really a huge shift in what&#8217;s possible.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Completing the Y</strong> <br/><br/>The Y chromosome is most commonly associated with individuals assigned male at birth, but may be found in others, such as intersex people. The sex characteristics regulated by DNA on the Y chromosome are also not equivalent to an individual's gender identity.<br/><br/>

<p>When scientists and clinicians study an individual&#8217;s genome, they compare the individuals&#8217; DNA to that of a standard reference to determine where there is variation. Until now, the Y chromosome portion of the human genome has contained large gaps which made it difficult to understand variation and associated disease.<br/><br/>The structure of the Y chromosome has been challenging to decode because some of the DNA is organized in palindromes &#8211; long sequences that are the same forward and backward&#160;&#8212; spanning up to more than a million base pairs. Moreover, a very large part of the Y chromosome that was missing from the previous version of the Y reference is satellite DNA &#8211; large, highly repetitive regions of non-protein-coding DNA. On the Y chromosome, two satellites are interlinked with each other, further complicating the sequencing process. <br/><br/>The researchers were able to achieve a gapless read of the Y chromosome due to advances in long-read sequencing technology and new, innovative computational assembly methods that could deal with the repetitive sequences and transform the raw data from sequencing into a usable resource. These new method assemblies allowed the team to tackle some of the particularly challenging aspects of the Y chromosome, such as pinpointing precisely where an inversion occurs in a palindromic sequence &#8212; a technique that can be used to find other inversions. The methods established in the paper will allow scientists to complete more end-to-end reads of human Y chromosomes to get a better understanding of how this genetic material affects the diverse human population. <br/><br/>&#8220;It was the Y chromosome that lacked the most sequences from the previous reference genome,&#8221; said Arang Rhie, a staff scientist at the National Human Genome Research Institute and the paper&#8217;s lead author. &#8220;It was always irritating knowing we were missing half the Y whenever we tried to do any reference-based analysis. I was really excited to curate the first complete Y, to see what we were actually missing, and what we can now do.&#8221;<br/><br/>It was an interest in studying the Y chromosome that led to the formation of the T2T consortium several years ago. Miga and Adam Phillippy, the co-leader of T2T and a senior author on the Y chromosome study, initially came together to launch the consortium after working together in 2018, using ultralong reads to complete the first sequence of a human centromere, the region where the two halves of the chromosome are linked together, on the Y chromosome. That region they completed was just 300,000 base pairs long.<br/><br/>Now, just five years later, the T2T consortium has filled in 30 million additional base pairs, in addition to the first fully sequenced human genome (all the autosomes and the X chromosome) that was released in 2022. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Enabling new research and discoveries</strong><br/><br/><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/08/10-mysteries-ycrhom.html"><img alt="10mysteries_graphic.jpg" height="400" src="images/10mysteries_graphic.jpg" style="float: right; border-width: 50px; margin: 25px;" width="350"/></a>While there are relatively few genes on the Y chromosome, the ones that are present are complex and dynamic, and code for important functions such as spermatogenesis, the production of sperm. The complete Y chromosome reference will allow scientists to better study a myriad of features about this part of the human genome in a way that has never before been possible.<br/><br/>The complex structure of the Y chromosome has lent itself to rapid evolution within its gene families. In fact, the Y chromosome is the most rapidly changing human chromosome, and even the most rapidly changing chromosome among great apes. This means two healthy people&#8217;s Y chromosomes can look very different &#8211; for example, one person might have 40 copies of one gene, while another person has 19 copies. This evolution can now be better studied using the new reference and the established methods for sequencing Y chromosomes. This could be the future focus of in vitro fertilization clinics or other research on reproduction and infertility. <br/><br/>The end-to-end Y chromosome sequence is a hugely important resource for those studying human population evolution and drift. This is because the Y chromosome is inherited from generation to generation in one group of genetic material, with very little recombination outside of that group, unlike the autosomes and genes on the human X chromosome which often recombine and share genetic material with each other. Having a clearer picture of the Y chromosome makes it easier to track genes across generations of inheritance and learn how the location and content of genes has changed over time. <br/><br/>The 30 million new bases added to the Y chromosome reference will also be crucial for studying genome evolution. It will now be possible to study specific and unique Y chromosome sequence patterns, such as the structure of the two satellites and the location and copy numbers of the genes. Even within the Y chromosome, the genes are split into several regions, which are very different from each other in terms of content, structure, and evolutionary history. Understanding rates of change on the Y chromosome and how to interpret this change are intriguing questions that will now be possible to study using the techniques developed in this paper to completely sequence human Y chromosomes. <br/><br/>The richer reference that includes the full sequence of the Y chromosome satellite DNA will also allow scientists to better understand the evolutionary relationship of these sequences with satellite DNA found elsewhere on the genome. <br/><br/>&#8220;It is exciting to be able to finally see these sequences in heterochromatic [densely-packed] regions for the first time. Finally, we can design experiments to test the impact and function of these previously unexplored parts of the Y chromosome,&#8221; Miga said.<br/><br/>It&#8217;s been shown that people with Y chromosomes can lose some or all of that genetic material as they age, but scientists have never fully understood why this happens and the effects it may have. The complete Y chromosome reference may help to illuminate this mystery. It will also be easier to study conditions and disorders that are linked to the Y chromosome, such as the lack of sperm production which leads to infertility. <br/><br/><strong>Contamination in bacterial genomes</strong></p>
<p><br/>An unexpected finding from this paper was that Y chromosome DNA has been repeatedly mistaken to be bacterial DNA in past studies due to the incomplete removal of human contamination in bacterial DNA. This discovery promises to improve the study of bacterial species&#8217; genomes. <br/><br/>Human DNA can appear as a contaminant in the genomic samples of bacterial species because the bacterial DNA is often taken from swipes off of human skin. Scientists use the current human genome reference to identify which sequences come from human contamination and remove those, leaving just the bacterial DNA for their study. But, because large parts of the human Y chromosome were missing from the past human reference, scientists were not able to identify them as human and thus mistook them to be part of the DNA of the species they were studying. <br/><br/>This paper finds evidence that about 5,000 bacterial genomes in a common database likely contained contamination matching human Y sequences. The groups studying these bacterial species can use the updated Y reference to correctly remove all human contamination from their reference genomes and get a clearer understanding of the bacterial genome. <br/><br/>&#8220;That was a surprising thing,&#8221; Rhie said. &#8220;People were guessing at it, but no one could prove that this was happening until now.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the complete human Y chromosome will open the door to many new discoveries, the researchers plan to further improve the study of this region by including the Y chromosome in future versions of the human pangenome. The pangenome is a new reference for genomics that combines the genomic information of multiple people from various ancestral backgrounds to ultimately enable more equitable research and clinical discoveries such as helping to diagnose disease, predict medical outcomes, and guide treatments.<br/><br/>In collaboration with the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium, the researchers plan to incorporate complete Y chromosome sequences into the individual genomes that make up the pangenome. This will help scientists understand how the Y chromosome varies among people of different ancestral backgrounds and provide a better point of reference for understanding the Y across the diversity of the human population. <br/><br/>The researchers hope to be able to collaborate with scientists around the world to enable others to complete Y chromosome sequencing. <br/><br/>&#8220;We aim to make these data widely accessible,&#8221; Miga said. &#8220;By creating and sharing these important catalogs of genetic differences on the Y chromosome, we can expand genetic studies of human disease and provide new insights into basic biology.&#8221;</p>

The team of researchers are <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/03/leaf-wetness-sensors.html">continuing to develop sensors</a> that use a biomimicry approach to provide better measurements of leaf wetness than what current state-of-the-art technology can provide.&#160;<br/><br/>These fairly inexpensive sensors can provide measurements for any leaf type which can help guide disease forecasting and improve crop management.

With this funding, the team will focus on optimizing their leaf sensors for commercially relevant crops such as strawberries, fava beans, spinach, and maize (corn).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Microbial sensors for monitoring soil health&#160;</strong><br/><br/>Lead Principal Investigator: Assistant Professor of ECE Colleen Josephson<br/>Co-Principal Investigators: Pat Pannuto (UC San Diego), George Wells (Northwestern University), Neal Blair (Northwestern University)<br/><br/>The soil microbiome is an important aspect of overall soil health, yet we don&#8217;t currently have an easy way to monitor the activities of this microbiome in real time. &#8220;Mud batteries,&#8221; also known as microbial fuel cells, generate electrical signals in response to microbe activity in the soil. The power output of the batteries fueled by bacteria could give clues to the health of the soil &#8211; a lower output might indicate that the soil is not a healthy environment for the crops that are planted in it.&#160;<br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of a new way to gain insights into soil health by monitoring the electrical output of these microbes, alongside other environmental conditions. Josephson&#8217;s team will use this funding to advance the development of mud battery-based soil sensors.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Guidance for using autonomous vehicles to monitor sensors on farms&#160;</strong><br/><br/>Lead Principal Investigator: Assistant Professor of ECE Steve McGuire&#160;<br/>Co-Principal Investigator: Assistant Professor of ECE Colleen Josephson<br/><br/>Sensors on farms can serve a variety of purposes, such as temperature and soil moisture monitoring. These sensing systems can improve how farmers allocate resources on the land and reduce environmental damage. However, the costs associated with building out infrastructure to fully implement dense sensor networks are an expensive barrier to entry. This project focuses on improving the link between soil modeling and sensor data sampling, paving the way for a farm with a large number of sensors out of which only a few might be read at any given time.<br/><br/>McGuire&#8217;s team will leverage autonomous aerial and ground vehicles to enable future agricultural methods based on gathering data from sensors more effectively. These data are then fed back into soil modeling to form a complete picture of the ecology of the farm, leading to improved decision making. As a result of this work, the team will develop fundamental technologies for precision agriculture to improve agricultural outcomes while reducing resource usage.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0a54e9878072704675fd2a3653f5e583"><name>10-mysteries-ycrhom</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>10 mysteries of the Y chromosome</title><summary>Researchers have just completed the first full sequence of a Y chromosome — what will we learn? </summary><start-date>1692802800000</start-date><display-name>10 mysteries of the Y chromosome</display-name><path>/2023/08/10-mysteries-ycrhom</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/08/10-mysteries-ycrhom</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1692390451531</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1692980022668</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Rose Miyatsu</name><title></title><phone/><email>rmiyatsu@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/08/images/sequence_400.png</path><link>site://news/2023/08/images/sequence_400.png</link><site>news</site><name>sequence_400.png</name><display-name>sequence_400.png</display-name><file-size>46735</file-size><width>400</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/08/images/sequence_80.png</path><link>site://news/2023/08/images/sequence_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>sequence_80.png</name><display-name>sequence_80.png</display-name><file-size>8387</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Researchers have just completed the first full sequence of a Y chromosome — what will we learn? </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium, co-led by UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute Associate Director Karen Miga and National Institutes of Health Genomics Research Institute Senior Investigator Adam Phillippy, has just completed the first sequencing of a full human Y chromosome!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Y chromosome is one of the smallest of the 46 human chromosomes, but it has been the most difficult for researchers to read. Until recently, more than half of it was unassembled. Having the full code for this unique chromosome could help unlock at least a few of its many mysteries.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are ten questions about the Y chromosome, and the answers we have so far:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>1. Why is it called the Y chromosome?<br/></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to popular belief, the Y chromosome is not shaped like the letter Y!&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The X chromosome was discovered first and given the name &#8220;X&#8221; because that is the traditional mathematical symbol for unsolved. When the Y chromosome was discovered about 15 years later, researchers just continued on with the alphabet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All chromosomes have roughly the same shape, but the Y chromosome is smaller in size &#8212; about a third of the size of the X chromosome.</span></p>
<br/><strong>2. What can the Y chromosome tell me about my ancestry?&#160;</strong><img alt="nhgri_ycrhom_400.png" height="225" src="images/nhgri_ycrhom_400.png" style="float: right; margin: 25px;" width="400"/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y chromosome inheritance is very unique. All other human chromosomes, including the X chromosome, recombine and share genetic material during reproduction, but the Y chromosome is passe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d along directly from parent to child with very little recombination.&#160;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this direct inheritance, being able to fully sequence different people&#8217;s Y chromosomes will help us better understand how genes are inherited and change across generations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, many popular genetic ancestry services like 23 and Me and FamilyTreeDNA provide a specific report on the Y chromosome because its unique inheritance allows these companies to place people in specific &#8220;haplogroups&#8221; &#8211; groups of people who have shared mutations in their DNA that show that they are likely descended from a common ancestor. Researchers have been able to trace what geographic regions many of these haplogroups originated in, giving people some idea of their ancestral origins.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>3. What are DNA palindromes and why is the Y chromosome full of them?<br/></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all human DNA, the human Y chromosome sequence is spelled out in A,T,C, and G base pairs, but the Y chromosome is unique in that it is full of palindromes &#8212; sequences of letters that are the same backward and forward, like kayak or racecar. The genes that are coded in palindrome-heavy regions help control important functions, such as the creation of sperm.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The palindromic structure creates "pairs" of genes, and some scientists think these could be a sort of backup to "repair" a copy if it acquires a harmful mutation.</span></p>
<br/><strong>4. What made the Y chromosome so difficult to sequence?&#160;<img alt="sequencing_400.png" class="" height="253" src="images/sequencing_400.png" style="margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 25px; float: right;" width="400"/><br/></strong>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until recently, sequencing and assembling full DNA palindromes was an expensive and labor-intensive process that had only been done once before. Now that we have found a way to assemble them more affordably and reliably, it could open the door for future studies of Y-chromosome-related fertility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As difficult as palindromes were to sequence, however, they were not the biggest challenge the sequencing consortium had. One of the arms of the Y chromosome has large regions of what is known as &#8220;satellite DNA,&#8221; or highly repetitive DNA regions, that proved impossible to accurately sequence until now.&#160; Satellite regions on the Y can vary greatly in length between individuals, but what they do is a huge mystery. Having the satellites sequenced brings us one step closer to understanding them better.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>5. Why do some people have more copies of Y chromosome genes than others?<br/></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Y chromosome is the fastest changing chromosome in humans, and even among all apes. This means two healthy people&#8217;s Y chromosomes can look very different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In two individuals with Y chromosomes, one could have 19 copies of a gene on the Y chromosome while the other could have 40. Nobody knows exactly why this happens or how it may impact processes in the body &#8212; yet.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully the new fully sequenced Y chromosome reference will help scientists figure out why these differences exist. The answers could help us better understand conditions like infertility.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>6. What can the Y chromosome tell us about bacteria?<img alt="bacteria_400.png" class="" height="382" src="images/bacteria_400.png" style="float: right;" width="400"/><br/></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may sound like a strange question, but the answer is actually a whole lot.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many bacterial samples are taken from swabs on humans, so they contain human contamination. When sequencing these bacterial samples, researchers have looked for snippets of sequences that match the pieces of the human reference genome in order to remove this contamination. Because we did not know the sequence for over half of the Y chromosome, however, sections of Y chromosome have been mistaken as bacteria genomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found that </span>as many as 5,000<span style="font-weight: 400;"> bacterial genomes in a common database likely contained contamination matching human Y sequences.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to better understand bacterial DNA could have huge implications for medicine, because the human body is full of microorganisms. Bacterial sequences have been used in research on everything from gut health to cancer.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>7. Why does the Y chromosome sometimes disappear as we age?&#160;<br/></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people have been observed to lose the Y chromosome from some of their blood cells as they age. Scientists are just beginning to unpack why, and the health implications this may have. So far experts have seen a connection to detrimental effects such as cardiac conditions, but other impacts are unknown. The complete Y chromosome sequence could help propel research on this important mystery.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>8. Could the Y chromosome ever completely disappear?&#160;<br/></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparing the Y chromosome in humans to that of other mammals, some researchers have proposed that over millions of years of evolution, the Y chromosome has slowly been losing genes. It has been theorized that over a long enough period of time, the Y chromosome could disappear entirely. This theory is highly controversial in the scientific community, but even if the Y chromosome did disappear, it wouldn&#8217;t necessarily mean the end of sexual differentiation &#8212; some rodent species lack a Y chromosome, but they still have differentiated sexual characteristics like ovaries and testes.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>9. What genes does the Y chromosome code for?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Y chromosome contains some very complex genes that code for important sexual functions like the creation of sperm. In fully sequencing the Y chromosome, researchers have also found 41 additional protein-coding genes. Some of these genes might be related to sexual characteristics, but others might not be. Although the Y chromosome contains SRY, an important sex-determining gene, other genes related to sexual characteristics are scattered throughout the rest of the genome, and genes on the sex chromosomes sometimes have non-sex-related functions. For example, the X chromosome contains the largest number of immune health-related genes in the human genome, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent work demonstrates that some genes on the Y chromosome contribute to cancer risk and severity.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<strong>10. Who has a Y chromosome?<img alt="bird_400.png" class="" height="451" src="images/bird_400.png" style="float: right;" width="400"/></strong><br/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Y chromosome is not just found in people assigned male at birth. Intersex people can have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, XXY, or even a mix of XX and XY in different cells of their body and present a spectrum of physical characteristics. The presence (or absence) of anatomy that has traditionally been labeled as &#8220;male&#8221; or &#8220;female&#8221; is not solid proof that an individual has a particular set of chromosomes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In animals, things get even more complicated. Some rodents don&#8217;t have Y chromosomes at all, and both sexes have a single X. For several species of voles, a quarter of females mysteriously have XY chromosomes. Bird and reptile species have different chromosomes entirely, with ZW females and ZZ males.&#160;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breathtaking views, mind-expanding lectures, community building, and outdoor adventures took center stage at UC Santa Cruz this weekend as hundreds of alumni gathered in the redwoods.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inaugural alumni celebration, Return to the Redwoods, was a hit as alumni ranging from the classes of 1969 to 2022 returned to campus with friends, family, and loved ones.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 400 alumni registered for events throughout the weekend, while over 300 chose to spend the weekend living in campus dorms and apartments at Cowell &amp; Stevenson College.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John D. Pine, Assistant Vice Chancellor of Alumni Engagement, says he is proud of the weekend&#8217;s turnout and is grateful to the attendees, staff, and volunteers that made it all possible.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Return to the Redwoods is a culmination of feedback we&#8217;ve heard from alumni about what ties them to this campus,&#8221; Pine said. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to have been able to offer an experience unlike any other at UC Santa Cruz and are already planning for next year. Save the date and tell your friends!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return to the Redwoods 2024 will take place August 16-18.&#160;</span></i></p>
<h3><strong>A Day in the Redwoods&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is nothing quite like returning to Santa Cruz and being greeted by the perfect weather. The weekend saw consecutive sunny, 70-degree summer days. The redwoods quietly rustled in the crisp breeze while the Monterey Bay glistened in clear view.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some alumni, the events began on Thursday evening at Woodstock's Pizza in Downtown Santa Cruz, but for most folks, the celebration kicked-off with a Friday evening reception. The majority of events took place on Saturday.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alumni began their Saturday morning with sunrise yoga on the East Field, followed by a continental breakfast in the Cowell Courtyard overlooking Monterey Bay. Afterward, alumni chose their own adventures. Whether alumni, friends, and family decided to partake in a sailing excursion, participate in a guided hike, reminisce in a lecture hall, or cruise around town, everyone got a taste of Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekend&#8217;s forest talks consisted of Kathy Foley&#8217;s lecture on Puppets and Performing Objects: Animism, Indigeneity, and the Anthropocene Puppets; and Raphe Kudela&#8217;s talk on how California&#8217;s coastal ecosystems, from marine fisheries impacted by harmful algal blooms to California&#8217;s iconic kelp forests, may change in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is what I remember about lectures at UCSC,&#8221; Past President of the Alumni Association Michael Riepe (Oakes &#8217;91) said after Kathy Foley&#8217;s discussion. &#8220;You&#8217;re not just being talked at and having knowledge poured into your mind; you&#8217;re having your mind blown and expanded in new ways.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overarching sentiment across generations of alumni: This campus is precisely how I remember it.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It feels very much like it was when I was here,&#8221; said alumni Steve Collins (Porter &#8217;85). &#8220;It was really nice speaking with many interesting people across generations. I also got to walk over to the west side of campus and went to the places I used to hang out and study.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For alumna Karen Zumsteg (Rachel Carson &#8217;93), who hadn&#8217;t returned to Santa Cruz in over 15 years, the Friday night Smores and Stars event on the East Field and the Saturday morning campus hike were her favorite events.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I got to see Saturn&#8217;s rings! Oh my gosh, it was so pretty and felt like nothing I&#8217;d ever done before,&#8221; Zumsteg said. &#8220;And then, the campus hike, guided by Dustin, I really appreciated that he had an idea of where we would go, but then he asked people if there were any particular places they wanted to see, and then he modified the route we took accordingly.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zumsteg and her friend&#8211;celebrating their 30th reunion&#8212;say they thoroughly enjoyed the overall weekend and wish it could have been longer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel like the variety of events and the curation of them felt so thoughtful, and I enjoyed everything I attended."</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empire Cave, in the upper campus area known as Cave Gulch, likely started as a crack in a rock. Slowly, over hundreds of thousands of years, rainwater and groundwater dissolved their way through the area&#8217;s marble bedrock, turning that crack into a water-filled cavern. Geologic forces eventually pushed the whole underground network upward, above the water table, draining the water and leaving a cave in its wake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cave and others in the area would eventually develop unique ecosystems. Empire Cave, sometimes called Porter Cave by UC Santa Cruz students and historically also known as Cowell Cave and Santa Cruz Cave, is now believed to serve as the primary habitat of a diverse assembly of organisms, several of which are only found in caves. In total, 76 species have been found in Empire Cave since scientific explorations began in the 1950s. Of these species, at least four have been found nowhere else on Earth, including the MacKenzie's cave amphipod and an as-yet-unidentified aquatic isopod, both of which are types of tiny crustaceans. Others cannot yet be attributed to any known species and may prove, upon further study, to be new species themselves. Among other rare inhabitants of the cave are the Dolloff's cave spider and the Empire Cave pseudoscorpion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, as part of a new approach to protect this unique habitat, a crew from the campus carpentry shop installed a wildlife-friendly gate across the Empire Cave entrance. Access is now limited to education, research, and the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an incredibly rare habitat that supports a number of species that are at risk of extinction,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Campus Natural Reserve Manager Alex Jones. &#8220;We have watched as conditions in the cave have deteriorated over the decades and it&#8217;s our duty as responsible stewards to do what we can to protect these organisms and their habitat from further harm.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, countless visits to the cave by visitors over the years have already damaged the habitat. Empire Cave &#8212; presumably named for its proximity to Empire Grade Road, itself named after the now long defunct Empire Mining Company &#8212; has long been a popular gathering spot. The cave saw visitors well before the campus was even built. A 2001 California Academy of Sciences report on the cave noted that the first reference to an &#8220;Empire Cave&#8221; in the area came in 1872. A study of cave usage in summer 2022 recorded 217 groups of people, presumably community members and students, visiting the cave over a 30-day period, or roughly seven groups a day. All told, 455 people entered the cave during that period. More than 20 of the visitors vandalized the exterior of the cave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past 150-plus years of visits have left the cave in tough shape. Stalagmites and stalactites appear to have once been prominent in the cave. All that is left now are a few rock stumps, some of them about 2 feet wide. The walls are covered with spray-painted graffiti that likely negatively impacts rare invertebrates that live on the cave&#8217;s rock walls. A recent visit revealed heaps of trash, from food wrappers to empty aluminum cans, as well as the remnants of a campfire. Names are etched into the cave walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said he believes that most who enter the cave do not mean to harm it. He knew of the cave when he was an environmental studies student at UC Santa Cruz in the 1990s, and said he fully understands the excitement that comes from exploring new places. A concrete cap was built over the entrance in 1963, but trespassers eventually breached it, allowing unregulated entry once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 report from scientists affiliated with the California Academy of Sciences ranked Empire Cave No. 3 of roughly 1,300 California caves in terms of biodiversity, but noted it's also one of the state&#8217;s most abused caves, &#8220;trashed by numerous visitors over the years.&#8221; Ironically, the report also notes that the concrete cap, while well-intentioned, likely negatively impacted the cave itself, drastically reducing the cave entrance dimensions, affecting light levels, and thwarting easy access by bats and amphibians.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said he&#8217;s seen a decline in some of the more visible species over the past decade. Visiting the cave earlier this month, he pointed to a group of twilight moths clustered on a graffitied wall. &#8220;This used to be covered with moths,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Johnson, president of the Western Cave Conservancy, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the natural wonder of caves in the western United States, said he was happy to hear about the gate project. &#8220;To be honest, that&#8217;s a cave that we thought was hopeless, in terms of its condition, so I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s an impetus to give its protection another try. It&#8217;s got unique species that survive only in Santa Cruz &#8212; nowhere else on Earth. We owe it to them not to tromp them out of existence if it&#8217;s avoidable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2021 UC Santa Cruz Long Range Development Plan, approved by UC Regents, includes a mitigation measure to limit human disturbance of cave ecosystems by discouraging any activity that jeopardizes the physical integrity, condition, or scientific value of the caves on UCSC property. The construction of a wildlife-friendly gate is included as a means to reduce further cave degradation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hope is that the new metal gate will protect the rare and sensitive ecosystem, ensuring the survival of the creatures that live there and preventing further degradation. A new sign has been posted at the cave entrance as part of the project, noting the cave&#8217;s scientific value and why access is now restricted. It includes two QR codes; one directs visitors to a </span><a href="https://ucsccampusreserve.ucsc.edu/maps-habitats-organisms-stewardship/cave-organisms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Natural Reserves webpage that explains the cave&#8217;s biodiversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the other to the 2017 </span><a href="https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/chap/chap_2017_rudolph_001.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Academy of Sciences report on California caves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that includes details on Empire Cave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure some folks will be disappointed that they&#8217;ll no longer be able to enter the cave, but the extreme sensitivity of the habitat and rarity of its organisms make it hard to argue that Empire Cave is not worth protecting,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Unfortunately it&#8217;s a place that we can love to death. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excluding people from nature is often not the right way to go, but with uncontrolled access to the cave, the long-term future of its many species was looking pretty bleak.</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the first day of rugby practice his freshman year, Jackson Zabierek (Merrill &#8217;23, economics and business management) said he would someday make the USA National Rugby Team. The 2023 UC Santa Cruz graduate just became one step closer to making his dream a reality.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zabierek was the 18th pick in the </span><a href="https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/major-league-rugby-collegiate-draft-results/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Major League Rugby Collegiate Draft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Los Angeles Team (</span><a href="https://www.majorleague.rugby/news/major-league-rugbys-atlanta-team-to-relocate-to-los-angeles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly Atlanta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) after making the USA Rugby U23 National Academy team, a stepping stone to the USA National Team. He will spend the next two and a half months training and conditioning with the USA National Academy in Charlotte, North Carolina. He will start playing with the Los Angeles Team in January.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zabierek is the first UCSC alumni ever to be drafted into a Major League Rugby team.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Everything&#8217;s riding on this,&#8221; Zabierek said before the draft. &#8220;Making it into the Academy could cement my ability to play professional rugby for as long as I wanted. The Academy would also set me on a path towards playing for the USA National Team, which would ultimately be the best thing I could do.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Rugby head coach Jeremy Sanford remembers the day Zabierek proclaimed he would one day play professional rugby. Sanford is overjoyed to see his former student and former Rugby Captain make it to where no UCSC alumni have been before.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you meet him, he&#8217;s strong, compact, agile, and dynamic, and that&#8217;s an amazing combination,&#8221; Sanford says. &#8220;But what makes him a step above everyone is that he works harder than any student I&#8217;ve ever met.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford added that Zabierek is the strongest rugby player he has ever seen in his over 14 years of coaching at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC&#8217;s Men&#8217;s Rugby </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/04/mens-rugby-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entered D1A status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the first time in the team&#8217;s history in the 2022-2023 season and demonstrated they belong in the highly competitive division. Zabierek&#8217;s history-making draft only solidifies UCSC&#8217;s ability to go head-to-head with collegiate rugby teams nationwide. Sanford says that Zabierek&#8217;s accomplishments will continue to make UCSC Rugby a sought-after team amongst prospective and transfer students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The impact is going to be profound,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;I hear from students all over California excited about coming to UCSC. I think what&#8217;s going to happen is that many students will realize that they want to play great rugby, go to a top research university, and be by the coast. They&#8217;ll put all those things together and say, &#8216;I can have it all if I go to UC Santa Cruz.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>From the East Field to the Major League&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UCSC, Zabierek played rugby for four years while he pursued his B.A. in economics and business management. He became captain in 2020 and continued to lead UCSC Rugby through its inaugural season in D1A in the 2022-2023 season.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating he played for the California Grizzlies, a team based in the Northern Bay Area. With the Grizzlies, Zabierek spent two weeks in Chile playing against top-tier international players. He said he is grateful for the experience that wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the support of his community back home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Zabierek set up a GoFundMe to raise funds to play rugby for the California Grizzlies. With the help of UCSC rugby alumni, coaches, friends, and family, he surpassed his fundraising goal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was really nice to see that support and the community&#8217;s generosity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure how much I&#8217;d be able to get, but the alumni went above and beyond and made it possible for me. They made that happen, and I&#8217;m very grateful.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zabierek has his eyes set on the USA National Team but says he&#8217;ll never forget the people that helped him get to where he is now.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss playing for Santa Cruz,&#8221; Zabierek said. &#8220;It was my home for the past four years, and the coaches and the players, I really couldn&#8217;t have asked for better people. They&#8217;re working hard, and I&#8217;m extremely excited to see them play this year. I&#8217;m even more excited to come back for the alumni game, put them to the test, and play alongside the people that helped me get to the Grizzlies and ultimately to where I am right now.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="245c8dba807270466c232fdd24caab24"><name>koerner-foundation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Koerner Family Foundation provides funds for five UCSC graduate students</title><summary>Five UC Santa Cruz doctoral candidates in Baskin Engineering were awarded a fellowship that covered nearly one-third of their tuition and fees in the 2022-2023 academic year.</summary><start-date>1692774000000</start-date><display-name>koerner-foundation</display-name><path>/2023/08/koerner-foundation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/08/koerner-foundation</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1692827159976</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1692827197151</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value><value>Applied Mathematics and Statistics</value><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Grace Stetson</name><title></title><phone/><email>grace.stetson@gmail.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/koerner-foundation-scholarshiplead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/koerner-foundation-scholarshiplead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>koerner-foundation-scholarshiplead.jpg</name><display-name>koerner-foundation-scholarshiplead.jpg</display-name><file-size>146770</file-size><width>500</width><height>400</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/koerner-foundation-scholarshipthumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/koerner-foundation-scholarshipthumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>koerner-foundation-scholarshipthumb.jpg</name><display-name>koerner-foundation-scholarshipthumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18604</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><strong>From Left to Right:</strong> Remy Nguyen, Samantha Conde, Tiffany Thang, Eric Malekos, and Zach Horton</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five UC Santa Cruz doctoral candidates in Baskin Engineering were awarded a fellowship that covered nearly one-third of their tuition and fees in the 2022-2023 academic year&#8212;giving them the opportunity to focus on the next steps in their educational and professional trajectories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Koerner Family Foundation&#8217;s current cohort of fellows&#8212;five of whom are from UC Santa Cruz&#8212;were each awarded a $12,000 grant. The UCSC awardees are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Samantha Conde</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Computational Media &#8212;&#160;researching Acculturative Game Design with Latine Communities</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>W. Zachary Horton,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Statistics &#8212;&#160;researching Flexible Mixture Modeling Approaches to Renewal Processes</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Eric Malekos</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Biomolecular Engineering &#8212;&#160;researching Characterization of novel peptides in inflammation and immunity</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Remy Nguyen</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Biomolecular Engineering &#8212; researching Reliable Computational Approaches for Identity Analysis from Low-Coverage Sequencing Data</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tiffany Thang,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Computational Media &#8212;&#160;researching Serious VR Games for the Social-emotional Support of People with Disabilities and Special Needs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation, which began its efforts in 2001, aims to inspire future generations of research-oriented engineers, encouraging students to both earn their doctoral degrees in engineering and then stay in the industry in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Koerner, president of the Koerner Family Foundation, explained that his family is a family of engineers, going back to his late father&#8217;s legacy as a civil engineering professor at Drexel University. When his parents passed, they endowed their savings to the Koerner Family Fellowship, perpetuating their legacy and strong belief in supporting American students through the financial woes of higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With so many alternate opportunities, I&#8217;m grateful that these Americans continue their academic pursuit to get engineering Ph.D.s&#8230;what can we do with this endowment to support that cause?&#8221; Koerner asked.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that understanding, Koerner and his family decided to launch this fellowship. They began their partnership with UC Santa Cruz in 2020. In the time since, the Koerner Family Foundation has supported six students at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main requirements for these grants are the student has completed their candidacy exams, they are actively doing research toward a Ph.D., and they are U.S. citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach Horton, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the Statistics department, said that the limited requirements for the fellowship application were in itself all the more reason to apply. With the $12,000 award, Horton is able to take time off from his additional jobs outside of his graduate studies to spend time with his wife and two children and work on his research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was floored to find out that I had received this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The practical benefits you get from this award, that&#8217;s huge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In calculating the impact of the award, Horton estimates that it adds a two or two-and-a-half increase to the buffer of usable money his family has after paying rent: &#8220;It&#8217;s very impactful and meaningful&#8230;it frees up between 10 to 15 hours per week.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha Conde, a third-year doctoral candidate in the Computational Media department, also completed her undergraduate work at UC Santa Cruz, and has seen the cost of living in Santa Cruz increase over the last seven years. Although she acknowledged her luck in finding places to live because of her longevity in town, she&#8217;s also seen rent and the relative cost of living continue to rise&#8212;which makes an award like the Koerner Family Fellowship even more impactful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It felt like it was too good to be true&#8230;it was just such an amazing surprise that came across my email,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, because of her research specificity, Conde has had a great deal of difficulty in finding grants, scholarships, and fellowships in the past. With this fellowship, Conde felt that it helped to make &#8220;everything else fall into place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It lifted so much weight off my shoulders, and it made me proud to see my work is validated,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was very honored and happy to be accepted as a fellow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main goal for this fellowship is to help these soon-to-be engineers to get over the finish line.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A $12,000 award can be that needed push to help a student as they complete coursework, research, writing and even begin their job search&#8212;but it could also be used for something not pertaining to their degree, like car payments or an engagement ring,&#8221; Koerner says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it can be really trying on a lot of these students to push through [the completion of their Ph.D.],&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we would like to insert some money and some encouragement and support&#8230;they can figure it out for themselves, how to take care of their lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these awards, Koerner said, the students &#8220;really open up the next generation of American industry and innovation.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2dd52363807270460074d17d8b1b6312"><name>curare-feature-ohara-danwhite</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC History Professor Matt O’Hara awarded National Endowment For The Humanities Public Scholars Fellowship for research project on curare</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz History Professor Matt O’Hara has received a prestigious $60,000 Public Scholars award from National Endowment For The Humanities for a research project focusing on the strange and tangled pharmaceutical history of curare,  a variety of plant-based arrow poisons long used by Indigenous peoples in the Amazon basin.&#13;

The funding will support O'Hara's research project focusing on the strange and tangled pharmaceutical history of curare, an umbrella term that refers to a variety of plant-based arrow poisons long used for hunting game by Indigenous peoples in the Amazon basin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s "Curare: A Tangled History Of Poison And Medicine" is one of<span>&#160;25 Public Scholar grants that the NEH funded this year. He&#160;</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will use the NEH Public Scholars award to finish researching and writing a book about curare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the early twentieth century, curare attracted the interest of chemists, botanists, and pharmaceutical companies, and a few charlatans and hucksters, eventually becoming the first commercial muscle relaxant,&#8221; O&#8217;Hara said. "It is a story that travels back and forth between the U.S. and the western Amazon, especially Ecuador, Brazil, and Peru.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Curare: A Tangled History Of Poison And Medicine" delves into the corporations and individuals associated with curare programs in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While we understand the sketchy outlines of this story, our knowledge is based on heroic narratives of North Atlantic researchers who &#8216;tamed&#8217; the plants of the jungle,&#8221; O&#8217;Hara wrote in a project summary. &#8220;Sometimes these were self-congratulatory memoirs of participants, who described their exploration in terms of a scientific civilizing mission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An historian of Latin America, O&#8217;Hara has explored the history of early Mexico, with research and publications on the history of religion and politics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, primarily. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is currently Provost of Stevenson College, served as chair of the History Department, and has received fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies and the Rockefeller Foundation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"This book is an exciting shift for me in terms of time, place, and theme,&#8221; O'Hara said. &#8220;As is the case for many historical projects, I stumbled across this project in the archives, uncovering a cache of documents left by some of the individuals in the curare story. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book will explore an intriguing question: Given its deep history, what led to the rapid-fire medicalization and marketing of an Indigenous arrow poison? What can this history tell us about the relationship between markets and medicines, the evolving ethics of medical research, and the origins of modern pharmaceuticals?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This book will answer these questions, at once reconstructing a strange history of exploration, clandestine trade networks, and coerced medical experimentation, but simultaneously narrating the collision of peoples, cultures, and economic interests that transformed curare into a blockbuster drug,&#8221; wrote O&#8217;Hara in a precis of the book.&#160;&#160;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/10/cider-initiative.html">Established in 2021</a>,&#160;CIDER&#160;brings together UC Santa Cruz students and faculty and industry partners to advance research that uses uncrewed aerial vehicles, aka UAVs or drones, and to train a drone-savvy workforce on California&#8217;s Central Coast.</p>
<p>Fenwick&#8217;s position at CIDER combines her hard-earned expertise in spatial data and sensor research with landscape conservation work she performed in various roles in the&#160;UC Natural Reserve System&#160;(NRS), the largest network of research reserves in the world, which includes 41 protected natural areas across California.</p>
<p>Fenwick was introduced to the NRS in a field ecology course while working on her Ph.D. in marine geology and geophysics at the&#160;Scripps Institution of Oceanography&#160;at UC San Diego, and she immediately fell in love.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought, oh my goodness, what an amazing resource UC has,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She joined the NRS as director of the&#160;James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve&#160;at UC Riverside and leader of the systemwide IT committee in 2007. As the James Reserve&#8217;s director, she managed the facility&#8217;s operations and research activities, including its usage as a test bed for the Center for Embedded Network Sensing, a now-retired research enterprise funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and led by UCLA.</p>
<p>&#8220;The center took computer scientists and ecologists, put them in a box and shook them up, and then out came all these sensors and new ways of measuring stuff,&#8221; Fenwick said. &#8220;The reserve got to test it all because they needed an outdoor location that had Wi-Fi, to see what happened when you put instruments that worked perfectly in the lab out where there are spiders and wasps and weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the next decade-plus, Fenwick held a number of facility, research and technology management positions with the NRS, including a stint at the&#160;Sierra Nevada Research Stations&#160;at UC Merced, where she worked closely with the National Park Service at Yosemite and Sequoia Kings Canyon. She served as the NRS&#8217;s first systemwide director of environmental information technology, where she helped to implement the UC NRS&#160;Climate Monitoring Network, a system of&#160;35 automated weather stations&#160;with high-precision equipment in diverse landscapes across the state.</p>
<p>Fenwick was also instrumental in developing the&#160;California Heartbeat Initiative&#160;(CHI), which used drones, multispectral cameras and wireless sensor stations to survey and monitor freshwater in California ecosystems. As co-PI, program director and lead drone pilot of CHI, she managed a broad swathe of administrative functions, while also coordinating field campaigns, overseeing a team of four pilots, processing data and performing survey flights.</p>
<p>After wildfires burned thousands of acres across the NRS in August 2020, Fenwick and other CHI researchers&#160;flew drones over the scorched landscapes&#160;to help assess the damage and understand how the reserves were recovering. (In an example of CITRIS serendipity, a&#160;<a href="https://citris-uc.org/citris-seed-award-aids-uc-natural-reserve-system-project/">2022 CITRIS Seed Funding project</a>&#160;led by UC Davis and UC Berkeley PIs is using this post-blaze data to help predict the impact of future wildfires on California landscapes.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent three years doing this fieldwork and I got particularly excited about drone technology,&#8221; Fenwick said. &#8220;When the COVID-19 pandemic began, I worked with [CIDER co-founders]&#160;Michael Matkin&#160;and [Santa Cruz County Third District Supervisor]&#160;Justin Cummings&#160;to develop a drone initiative for CITRIS.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drone research was happening on every campus in the UC system, but there wasn&#8217;t a coordinated drone teaching program before CIDER.&#8221;</p>
<p>CIDER is the first formal drone education program at the University of California, offering&#160;pilot training, faculty mentorship and industry connections for undergraduate students at UC Santa Cruz. In CIDER&#8217;s 16-week curriculum, students receive hands-on instruction and the opportunity to fly and program drones, as well as a stipend and the chance to take the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 107 pilot certification exam without charge.</p>
<p>Students from groups that have been historically underrepresented in STEM fields, including women and people of color, are particularly encouraged to apply to the Pilot Training Program.&#160;</p>
<p>Once students receive their drone pilot&#8217;s license, they are eligible to work with CIDER&#8217;s industry partners. CIDER accepts contracts within the UC system and with external companies for research and surveying jobs that require drones, and the program employs students to provide them with practical work experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ask industry partners what they&#8217;re looking for in new employees in terms of skill sets and interests,&#8221; Fenwick said. &#8220;So we can make sure that our students have those skills and can get those jobs once they&#8217;ve graduated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of Fenwick and the CIDER team, UC Santa Cruz is the first campus in the system to receive&#160;FAA Unmanned Aircraft Systems Collegiate Training Initiative (UAS-CTI) designation.&#160;</p>
<p>Since 2019, Fenwick has also served as an instructor and coordinator at&#160;DroneCamp, a weeklong annual short course that CIDER co-hosts alongside the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources; the UC Center of Excellence on Unmanned Aircraft Systems Safety housed at UC Merced; California State University, Monterey Bay; and the Monterey Bay Drone, Automation and Robotics Technology (DART) Initiative.&#160;</p>

<p>Open to people of all skill levels, DroneCamp focuses on the research applications of drone technology. Attendees over the program&#8217;s seven-year history have included industry partners, community members, research faculty and students such as&#160;Jon Detka, a Ph.D. candidate in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>As part of his doctoral research, Detka was studying patterns in tree and shrub canopy dieback due to drought at the&#160;Fort Ord Natural Reserve, but his&#160;data collection method&#160;&#8212; swinging around a 20-foot-long swimming pool sweep with a GoPro video camera attached &#8212; was proving to be ineffective and dangerous. While he knew about the potential of drone technology for fieldwork, he felt he had neither the experience nor the resources to use them in his project.&#160;</p>
<p>Enter Becca Fenwick, who at that point was performing frequent drone surveys for CHI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the reserve&#8217;s proximity to Marina Municipal Airport, I thought it would prove challenging to get authorized drone flight surveys,&#8221; said Detka. &#8220;Becca was instrumental in putting me in contact with the right people to make the surveys happen.&#160;She helped me identify resources, navigate permissions, and gain valuable flight training and data processing experience as part of the ongoing CHI surveys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detka now works for CIDER as a senior drone pilot and advanced geographic information systems (GIS) technician, working with Fenwick to design CIDER&#8217;s curriculum while finishing his doctorate.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what sets Becca apart as a leader is that she understands the value of mentoring as part of the learning and research training process. She meets students where they are,&#8221; Detka said.</p>
<p>Fenwick is working to expand CIDER&#8217;s footprint beyond the UC Santa Cruz campus. Last year, the initiative and several partner organizations&#160;received $1 million from the James Irvine Foundation&#160;to develop a workforce training program for the Salinas and Pajaro Valley regions. The new program will establish a pathway for incumbent workers as well as students, with an emphasis on serving communities that have been historically excluded from high-tech professions.&#160;</p>
<p>A&#160;similar project, also funded by the Irvine Foundation, has Fenwick collaborating with longtime partner&#160;Monterey Bay DART, a public benefit corporation with a mission to grow climate-smart, high-tech industry on the Central Coast. DART&#8217;s executive director, Josh Metz, commends Fenwick as a &#8220;strategic thinker, inspirational team leader and impactful doer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Becca shows up to each project with great enthusiasm for the subject, deep understanding of theoretical and technical issues, and a desire to see her work have real impacts on people&#8217;s lives for the better,&#8221; Metz said. &#8220;I feel honored to call her a colleague.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the support of a&#160;2022 CITRIS Seed Award, Fenwick and co-PI&#160;Alice Agogino&#160;will turn their attention to aiding and educating emergency responders during wildfires. While Agogino leads the creation of a fleet of drone-deployed, sensor-equipped robots to collect data on fire-prone areas, Fenwick is developing a curriculum that teaches fire response professionals how to use those drones and process the information that their sensors return.</p>
<p>Fenwick will also co-direct a&#160;five-year, $10 million project, led by CITRIS PI&#160;Stacy Philpott&#160;and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to cultivate a diverse food and agriculture workforce. The program will support the educations of K-12 students, UC Santa Cruz undergraduate and graduate students, and local farmworkers.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re working with a student,&#8221; Fenwick said, &#8220;you can see that light bulb go on and you can almost hear them thinking of all the different ways they could use that technology. It&#8217;s really satisfying and fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super excited about the potential of drones, not just here at Santa Cruz but across the CITRIS campuses,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to see where we are in a year or two.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="46d1203d80727046466103398ceeb131"><name>fredston-marine-heatwaves</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Coastal fisheries show surprising resilience to marine heatwaves</title><summary>Researchers found that fish biomass often increased or was unaffected in the year following a marine heatwave.</summary><start-date>1693378800000</start-date><path>/2023/08/fredston-marine-heatwaves</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/08/fredston-marine-heatwaves</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1693405225001</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1693417178669</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/08/images/alexa-fredston_ocean2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/08/images/alexa-fredston_ocean2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexa-fredston_ocean2.jpg</name><display-name>alexa-fredston_ocean.jpg</display-name><file-size>157261</file-size><width>500</width><height>333</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/08/images/alexa-fredston_ocean3.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/08/images/alexa-fredston_ocean3.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alexa-fredston_ocean3.jpg</name><display-name>alexa-fredston_ocean.jpg</display-name><file-size>22065</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexa Fredston is an assistant professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Researchers found that fish biomass often increased or was unaffected in the year following a marine heatwave</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SANTA CRUZ, CA&#8212;Prolonged periods of unusually warm ocean temperatures, known as marine heatwaves, can have devastating effects on marine ecosystems and have been linked to widespread coral bleaching, harmful algal blooms, and abrupt declines in commercially important fish species. A new study, however, has found that marine heatwaves in general have not had lasting effects on the fish communities that support many of the world&#8217;s largest and most productive fisheries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study, published August 30 in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, relied on data from long-term scientific trawl surveys of continental shelf ecosystems in North America and Europe from 1993 to 2019. The analysis included 248 marine heatwaves with extreme sea bottom temperatures during this period. Trawl surveys, done by towing a net above the seafloor, assess the abundance of bottom-dwelling species that include commercially important fish such as flounder, pollock, and rockfish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers looked for effects on fish biomass and community composition in the year following a marine heatwave. To their surprise, they did not find evidence that marine heatwaves in general have big effects on regional fish communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is an emerging sense that the oceans do have some resilience, and while they are changing in response to climate change, we don&#8217;t see evidence that marine heatwaves are wiping out fisheries,&#8221; said lead author Alexa Fredston, assistant professor of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although declines in biomass did occur after some marine heatwaves, the researchers say these cases were the exception, not the rule. Overall, they found, the effects of marine heatwaves are not distinguishable from the natural variability in these ecosystems and in the sampling process of the surveys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The oceans are highly variable, and fish populations vary quite a lot. Against that background, we didn&#8217;t see evidence of marine heatwaves dramatically reducing the abundance of fish in the temperate oceans,&#8221; Fredston said. &#8220;Marine heatwaves can drive local change, but there have been hundreds of marine heatwaves with no lasting impacts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to assessing the impact on biomass, the researchers looked at whether marine heatwaves were causing changes in the composition of fish communities, such as a loss of species associated with cold water and an increase in species associated with warm water (known as &#8220;tropicalization&#8221;).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tropicalization has been associated with long-term warming of the oceans, but we saw no consistent signature of that associated with marine heatwaves,&#8221; Fredston said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers defined marine heatwaves as periods of more than five days with extreme sea bottom temperatures (above the 95th percentile) for that region and season. By subtracting out the effects of long-term ocean-warming trends, they were able to focus on episodes of extreme warming on top of those long-term trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data set included some notable examples of marine heatwaves that did have profound impacts, such as the 2014-2016 marine heatwave in the Northeast Pacific known as &#8220;the Blob,&#8221; one of the largest on record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The magnitude of the impact for that one was very unusual,&#8221; Fredston said. &#8220;There were some really problematic outcomes, including huge declines in the Gulf of Alaska, where commercial fisheries really suffered, but other West Coast fisheries did well because a lot of species came up from the south.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While &#8220;the Blob&#8221; led to a 22% loss of biomass in the Gulf of Alaska, a 2012 marine heatwave in the Northwest Atlantic led to a 70% biomass gain. The authors also noted that these were not large changes compared to natural variability in biomass, and similar effects were not seen after most other marine heatwaves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings suggest that fish may be able to find safe havens by moving to areas with cooler water during these extreme events. Other factors besides temperatures may also be important in determining the response of an ecosystem to a marine heatwave, Fredston noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very curious to look at other aspects of this to see if we can predict the ecosystem response,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At this point, it will be hard to predict the impacts of the next marine heatwave."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This research was performed as part of</span><a href="https://fishglob.sites.ucsc.edu/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">FISHGLOB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an international consortium that has compiled a unique data set of scientific bottom trawl surveys from around the world.

These two-year grants are designed to spur implementation of solutions that advance climate resilience and social equity. Five UC Santa Cruz projects secured a total of more than $9.5 million in funding through the program, and three faculty members received additional subawards totalling more than $2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will support UC Santa Cruz and partners in tackling some of California's toughest climate change challenges through innovative research and community engagement.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Maximizing benefits from the state&#8217;s composting program</strong></h2>
<figure class="image align-left"><img alt="man's hands holding household compost collection bin with food scraps" height="267" src="images/compost-400.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="400"/></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team of researchers led by Environmental Studies Professor and Gliessman Presidential Chair in Water Resources and Food Sustainability Elliott Campbell won a $1.99 million grant to study implementation strategies for California&#8217;s plan to reduce methane emissions by diverting 75% of organic waste from landfills by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state&#8217;s rapid transition from landfill disposal to composting of organic waste will require building new infrastructure and planning carefully for what to do with the resulting compost. But the process could potentially offer a host of benefits in the agricultural lands where compost might be applied, including drought tolerance from increased soil moisture, enhanced carbon sequestration, and perhaps even reduced runoff of nutrient pollutants. Researchers will combine modeling techniques with new experimental data to offer decision support tools for how to maximize potential benefits while minimizing any social or environmental risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team will run experiments to better understand the industrial composting process and the physical, biological, and chemical properties of the compost produced. They&#8217;ll also model the overall emissions footprint of landfill diversion under different scenarios to show how to optimize the net reduction in global warming potential. Researchers will map out where additional composting capacity might be needed and provide recommendations for where to put new facilities, incorporating insights on how market forces might affect demand for compost. And the team will model how compost can best be distributed geographically to maximize environmental benefits, including how much to apply for different soil types across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a very special time to be doing this type of research,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;There are many investments being made in infrastructure over the next few years, so if ever there was a time to do this type of large-scale coordinated research on composting, it&#8217;s right now. What California is doing with this statewide mandate is pretty unprecedented, so this could become a model for other parts of the country and world.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Supporting farmworker health and safety</strong></h2>
<figure class="image align-left"><img alt="farmworkers harvesting plants in a field" class="" height="266" src="images/farmworkers-400.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="400"/></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $1.99 million grant will help to equip California farmworker communities with new tools to address the damaging impacts of climate change on their health and livelihoods. Politics Professor and Global &amp; Community Health Program Executive Vice Director Matt Sparke will lead the project, with support from a broad contingent of 18 UC Santa Cruz faculty and partners at 10 community organizations and four other universities across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team will map out climate-related risk factors&#8212;like extreme heat, wildfire smoke, drinking-water pollution, flood damage, and crop failures&#8212;that disproportionately affect farmworkers and increase their vulnerability to ill-health, stress, and depression. A new bilingual app will share this information so that farmworkers, health workers, and farm supervisors can easily identify geographic &#8220;hotspots&#8221; of risk. The app and associated website will also include a health vulnerability checklist to help users identify key resources available or needed in their area to mitigate climate-related harms, and users can submit their responses to provide new data on these issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project will additionally build partnerships among farmworkers, community health workers, growers, governments, and other stakeholders in the Pajaro, Salinas, and San Joaquin Valleys to develop solutions for the health and safety of farmworkers. Students from UC Santa Cruz and local high schools will support these efforts. Researchers will also study how new strategies and technologies that agricultural businesses might use to adapt to climate change could affect farmworkers, and the team will test some nature-based solutions with positive potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our approach is ultimately about adapting to the challenges that come with living in a climate-changed world, but this is not a passive adaptation or a vision of resilience that is about returning to the status quo,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;The goal is really to build back better&#8212;based upon the deep knowledge that farmworkers, growers, and government officials already have&#8212;in ways that enable people to be positive change agents.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Connecting the housing crisis to climate impacts</strong></h2>
<figure class="image align-left"><img alt="A firefighter sprays water on a fencepost in a rural area" class="" height="267" src="images/wildfire-400.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" width="400"/></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor of Sociology Miriam Greenberg will lead a roughly $1.6 million grant project to conduct a first-of-its kind study of how California&#8217;s housing crisis affects the growth of the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), where the fringes of development reach into natural areas. Development in the WUI now accounts for 50% of all new housing in the state, but the proximity to fire-prone landscapes and remoteness from emergency response services increases the risk from climate-related natural disasters. WUI development also impacts environmental health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers from the social sciences will conduct statistical and GIS analysis alongside interviews and surveys of WUI residents in order to identify areas where WUI development trends may primarily reflect lower income people being displaced from urban areas. Together with community partners&#8212;including Community Bridges, the Monterey Bay Central Labor Council, and the Santa Cruz County Office of Response, Recovery &amp; Resilience&#8212;research teams will study what&#8217;s driving migration to the WUI, from affordability pressures to lifestyle choices; the demographics of this migration; and resulting dynamics, like growing commute sheds and vulnerability to hazards. The project will focus on California&#8217;s Central Coast, one of the most unaffordable housing markets in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team will also work with the Amah Mutsun Relearning Program and the Native Plant Program at the UCSC Arboretum &amp; Botanic Garden and the Central Coast Prescribed Burn Association to study how the WUI impacts the effectiveness of prescribed burns for restoring culturally and ecologically significant habitat. They&#8217;ll use their findings to define different types of WUI impacts on fire and habitat and to demonstrate how some fire management and land stewardship strategies are best suited to certain WUI types. Researchers will also analyze the relationship between the WUI and puma behavior, demonstrating how different types of WUI development have varying habitat fragmentation impacts. Overall, results from the project will be shared through a &#8220;WUI Equity Atlas,&#8221; an interactive, online regional planning tool that will show connections between housing, climate, and conservation issues over space and time. The group will groundtruth the atlas through regional gatherings hosted by the Trust for Public Land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see this as an opportunity to bring together a wide range of people who care about each of these issues,&#8221; Greenberg said. &#8220;Bringing those conversations together and showing people how these crises are related can help to center the critical need for affordable urban housing as part of the climate action and sustainability movement.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Advising on new Pajaro River levee system</strong></h2>

<figcaption>Photo: Robert Campbell, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team led by Hydrogeologist and Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor Andrew Fisher received a $1.99 million grant to determine how a state and federally-funded levee setback project along the Pajaro River could work with natural hydrologic processes to improve future maintenance and management of flood control areas and provide ecosystem, water quality, and water supply benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new research will support the Pajaro River Flood Risk Management Project, an initiative decades in the making that will begin work this year to modify, move, and reshape about 15 miles of levees, widening reaches for the Pajaro River and Corralitos and Salsipuedes Creeks in the process. This past March, a levee on the south bank of the Pajaro River breached, flooding the town of Pajaro and demonstrating the urgent need for levee improvements. UC Santa Cruz-led researchers&#8212;working with colleagues from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, CSU Monterey Bay, and the Resource Conservation District of Santa Cruz County&#8212;will assess conditions in the river channels and expanded river bank and wetland areas that will be contained within newly widened and rebuilt levees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team will conduct measurements, sampling, analysis, and modeling to better understand factors like channel flow, sediment types and transport processes, aquifer recharge, and water quality within these parts of the river system, while also identifying opportunities to enhance wildlife habitat. The results will inform an operation and maintenance plan for the areas between the new levees in order to deliver as many different types of benefits as possible while optimizing flood control effects. The team will also explore how to streamline permitting processes for these types of multi-benefit projects in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through this grant, we get to work with partners across the community and at state and federal levels to protect against impacts of larger and more frequent floods while also improving ecosystem resilience,&#8221; Fisher said. &#8220;Our work is just one part of a much larger project, but we hope to provide data and tools that engage and empower agencies, community groups, and stakeholders to pursue a wide range of benefits and adaptively manage the levee project as it moves forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Engaging the public through art and science</strong></h2>

</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Nelson, director of the UCSC Institute of the Arts and Sciences, is teaming up with Ocean Science Professor Ari Friedlaender on a $2 million grant project to develop a research-based traveling art exhibition that will connect climate change impacts on whales and other marine animals with the precarity of vulnerable human communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition will be built around three major art and science collaborations featuring artists from some of the communities most impacted by climate change. Visual artists will explore the economic processes underlying both the disparate impacts of climate change on local farmworkers and the effects of agricultural runoff on migratory whales in the Monterey Bay. Sound artists and composers will develop an experience that helps people understand how melting Arctic sea ice changes whale behavior and impacts California&#8217;s coastal communities. And filmmakers and digital artists will share Indigenous experiences of migration that could shed new light on efforts to protect whales, as climate change threatens their migration patterns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each facet of the project will require new scientific research and close collaboration with partners, including Indigenous groups, community organizations, and nonprofits. The resulting exhibition will travel to university and public art museums across California. The project ultimately aims to improve understanding and problem solving around climate change in a way that addresses inequities in impacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The urgency that we see in this work is that solutions to climate change are going to come from science and technology, but the public&#8217;s decision to embrace those solutions is going to require a social and cultural shift,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s something that the arts can help to accomplish.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Collaborating on subawards</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Gilbert, an associate project scientist for the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, received a roughly $1.7 million subaward on a </span><a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/08/23/five-uc-berkeley-led-projects-awarded-california-climate-action-grants"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-led project called COEQWAL (COllaboratory for EQuity in Water ALlocations) that will develop new water planning tools to advance sustainable, inclusive, and equitable water distribution for the state&#8217;s nearly 40 million people. As part of the project, Gilbert will lead a UC Santa Cruz team in developing water allocation models to explore alternative scenarios for managing water under a changing climate while coordinating analysis of results among collaborators across UC and CSU campuses. UC Santa Cruz researchers and NOAA collaborators will also analyze how water allocations under a changing climate affect endangered Central Valley salmon, as one of the project&#8217;s three use cases.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emily Reigh, assistant professor of science education, received a subaward of more than $100,000 on a project led by </span><a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/08/23/five-uc-berkeley-led-projects-awarded-california-climate-action-grants"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Berkeley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entitled &#8220;Preparing Teachers to Implement Justice-Centered Climate Change Pedagogy.&#8221; A collaboration between practicing teachers, teacher educators, scientists, and community advocacy groups, the project will develop a toolkit to support K-12 students in learning about climate change and taking action toward climate justice in their own communities. Reigh will study how up-and-coming science teachers learn to teach about climate justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Professors of Electrical and Computer Engineering Keith Corzine and Leila Parsa received a more than $250,000 subaward on a </span><a href="https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/news/2023/university-awards-over-80-million-state-funded-grants-spur-climate-action"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Merced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-led project titled &#8220;Improving Preparedness of Communities for Evacuations using Zero Emission Vehicles.&#8221; UCSC&#8217;s role will be to develop decision-aid tools that can guide community investments in charging, the power system, and transportation networks to allow zero-emissions vehicles to evacuate safely in the event of an emergency.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4c235e638072704615df5ac432fb2c84"><name>kim-naturebme23</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New blood test for noncoding RNA significantly improves cancer detection</title><summary>Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Daniel Kim and his lab are developing more accurate and powerful liquid biopsy technologies that take advantage of signals from RNA “dark matter,” an understudied area of the genome.</summary><start-date>1693494000000</start-date><display-name>New blood test for noncoding RNA significantly improves cancer detection</display-name><path>/2023/08/kim-naturebme23</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/08/kim-naturebme23</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1693494500943</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1693512698104</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/08/images/kim_375.png</path><link>site://news/2023/08/images/kim_375.png</link><site>news</site><name>kim_375.png</name><display-name>kim_375.png</display-name><file-size>299977</file-size><width>375</width><height>485</height></image><image-alt>Portrait of Kim with redwoods in the background</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/08/images/kim_80.png</path><link>site://news/2023/08/images/kim_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>kim_80.png</name><display-name>kim_80.png</display-name><file-size>17716</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Portrait of Kim with redwoods in the background</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Daniel Kim (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta).</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>A novel liquid biopsy technology developed by Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Daniel Kim’s lab leverages RNA “dark matter” to enhance cancer diagnosis
</article-subhead><article-text><p>Cancer is most treatable in its early stages, so finding innovative and non-invasive methods to diagnose cancer early on is crucial for fighting the disease. Liquid biopsies, which require just a simple blood draw, are an emerging technology for non-invasively testing for cancer using DNA or RNA sequencing of a patient&#8217;s blood.</p>
<p>Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Daniel Kim and his lab are developing more accurate and powerful liquid biopsy technologies that take advantage of signals from RNA &#8220;dark matter,&#8221; an understudied area of the genome. Kim&#8217;s new research shows that this genetic material is present in the blood of people with cancer and can be identified to diagnose specific cancer types such as pancreatic, lung, esophageal, and others early in the course of the disease.&#160;</p>
<p>Kim&#8217;s lab developed an RNA liquid biopsy platform that detects both protein-coding RNA and RNA dark matter in the blood, and showed that this new approach significantly improves the performance of liquid biopsy for cancer diagnosis.<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01081-7"><u>This research was published today</u></a><span>&#160;</span>in the journal<span>&#160;</span><em>Nature Biomedical Engineering</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on &#8216;dark matter&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>While most researchers and companies are pursuing DNA-based liquid biopsy for cancer diagnosis, Kim&#8217;s approach is unique in its focus on RNA &#8220;dark matter,&#8221; specifically noncoding and repetitive RNA.&#160;</p>
<p>Most of the three billion base pairs of DNA that make up the human genome are transcribed into RNA, and all of the RNA is collectively known as the transcriptome. The most commonly recognized function of RNA is to code for proteins in the body, but 75% of the human genome generates noncoding RNA that does not code for proteins.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of these noncoding RNAs are derived from repetitive elements, and these RNAs can travel out of the cell from which they originate and into the bloodstream. A healthy individual&#8217;s blood typically would have very few of these repetitive noncoding RNAs. However,<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/kim-cell-reports.html"><u>Kim&#8217;s research has shown</u></a><span>&#160;</span>that even at the earliest stages of cancer, many of these repetitive RNAs are secreted out of cancer cells, making them potent biomarkers of early-stage disease.</p>
<p>RNA liquid biopsy technology developed by the Kim lab aims to detect cancer by sequencing &#8220;cell-free RNA&#8221; in a patient&#8217;s blood to test for the presence of both protein-coding and repetitive noncoding RNA.</p>
<p>Kim&#8217;s lab created a cell-free RNA sequencing and analysis platform called COMPLETE-seq to identify repetitive noncoding RNAs that are typically overlooked. After a patient&#8217;s blood is drawn, this comprehensive approach analyzes the sample for all of the annotated areas of the transcriptome &#8212; the tens of thousands of RNAs that have already been well-documented&#8212; plus all of the five million noncoding repetitive elements that Kim&#8217;s lab also focuses on.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at these different cancers, each has its own characteristic cell-free RNA profile, but a lot of these RNAs are coming from the millions of repeat elements that are found throughout the genome,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;What we found was that when we trained machine learning models for cancer classification, the models perform better when you introduce these repetitive cell-free RNAs as additional features. We see higher sensitivity in terms of detecting cancer, so we think that these repeat elements are actually providing a lot of rich cell-free RNA information that people previously hadn't looked for.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Improving tests</strong></p>
<p>Other existing liquid biopsy tests have not been very sensitive for early stage cancer, with some tests missing up to 75% of stage I cancers, when the biological signal is low due to the small tumor size. Kim&#8217;s paper shows that incorporating repetitive RNA into their liquid biopsy platform greatly increases the biological signal and boosts the performance of machine learning models tasked to identify cancer. As an example, using COMPLETE-seq improved performance to 91% sensitivity for identifying colorectal cancer.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The value of our study is that we've now shown the potential of these repeat elements for diagnosing disease, so hopefully there'll be a lot of interest in leveraging repetitive RNAs to boost the sensitivity of these multi-cancer early detection tests,&#8221; Kim said.</p>
<p>The research findings show that this technology can be used to identify a variety of cancer types. The lab initially focused on pancreatic cancer for this study, as there is an urgent clinical need for pancreatic cancer early detection, as late detection leads to worse outcomes for patients. Pancreatic cancer is also known to be driven by mutations in the KRAS gene, which is also a focus of Kim&#8217;s lab.</p>
<p>After verifying findings in pancreatic cancer, the researchers also looked at a variety of other cancers, and plan to look at many more cancer types with additional samples across the progressive stages of cancer. The team is interested in collaborating with clinicians and companies to do this.&#160;</p>
<p>Kim&#8217;s goal is to develop an RNA liquid biopsy test for multi-cancer early detection, using the rich information from repetitive RNAs to identify and diagnose disease with high sensitivity and specificity. Kim hopes his platform will not only diagnose cancer at the earliest stages but also help guide individualized, precise treatment strategies when the cancer is more treatable. Moreover, his test could help to identify a recurrence of cancer, and also be used to study aging and to diagnose other types of diseases that alter the repetitive RNA landscape, such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. He recently gave the<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK-RYu5ogf4"><u>UCSC Kraw Lecture</u></a><span>&#160;</span>on &#8220;Precision Health for All Through RNA&#8221; that laid out his vision for early detection and precise treatment of disease using RNA.&#160;</p>
<p>The researchers also used nanopore sequencing to read the cell-free RNAs floating in the blood, which allowed them to generate long-reads and determine the true length of these cell-free RNAs. Kim believes his lab is the first to use nanopore sequencing,<span>&#160;</span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/08/nanopore-feature.html"><u>a technique pioneered at UC Santa Cruz</u></a>, for RNA liquid biopsies to diagnose cancer and to determine the full length of these cell-free RNAs. Nanopore sequencing can be performed on a handheld device developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies called the MinION. This holds promise for carrying out cancer screening in remote or resource-poor settings where larger, more expensive sequencers are not readily available.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study would not have been possible without the strong support of the American Cancer Society and all of its generous donors, leadership, staff, and volunteers, as well as all of the hard work of my PhD student Roman Reggiardo (an NIH F99/K00 Fellow now at HHMI Investigator Howard Chang&#8217;s lab at Stanford University) and all of our Kim lab members and collaborators,&#8221; Kim said.&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to his role as an Assistant Professor in the Baskin School of Engineering associated with the Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells, the Genomics Institute, and the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at UC Santa Cruz, Kim is also an Associate Member of the Canary Center at Stanford for Cancer Early Detection and a Research Scholar of the American Cancer Society.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/07/kim-cell-reports.html</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4cbae19a8072704615df5ac4ff87bbbf"><name>linda-anderson</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title> Retired faculty member Linda Anderson connects to her nature-loving roots volunteering at the Arboretum</title><summary>Retired UCSC marine sciences instructor and researcher grew up appreciating California native plants.

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linda Anderson (B.S. &#8217;81 Earth sciences; M.S. &#8217;84; Ph.D. &#8217;89) has been a volunteer with the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum and Botanic Garden since she retired from the university over 15 years ago. Anderson is a lifelong nature lover with deep roots at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;it only makes sense that she would spend her retired years tending UCSC&#8217;s largest garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing her first undergraduate degree in zoology and chemistry at UC Berkeley, Anderson moved to Santa Cruz in 1976. She got involved in environmental activism and lobbied the California Board of Forestry, advocating for select harvest in Santa Cruz County. Anderson became more invested in protecting California&#8217;s natural environment, particularly in regard to timber harvesting. This prompted her to pursue a second bachelor&#8217;s degree in geology at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following her undergraduate studies, she continued her education in Earth sciences, earning her master&#8217;s degree and Ph.D. from UCSC with a focus on geochemistry. After a stint at the US Geological Survey, Anderson returned to UCSC in 1996 until her retirement in 2012.&#160; Her research focused on the chemical composition of oceans over geologic time-scales, the field of paleoceanography.&#160; These studies utilize chemical signatures captured in oceanic sediment cores laid down over millions of years.&#160; One unicellular organism, foraminifera, incorporates trace elements into its shell depending on the pH and temperature of the surrounding ocean, providing insights into past climates.&#160; This information provides valuable insights into the earth&#8217;s response to climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she enjoyed studying and teaching the wonders of the ocean, being a chemist meant she had to stay inside a lab when she really wanted to be outside exploring nature. &#8220;I realized that when I retired I wanted to be outside,&#8221; Anderson says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson began volunteering with the Arboretum two years before she retired. Out of the four gardens&#8212;three of which feature plants from afar in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa&#8212;Anderson knew that she wanted to dedicate her time to local indigenous plants in the California Natives Garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Pasadena, Anderson&#8217;s love for nature began with California native plants as they were near and dear to her mother. &#8220;When my family went camping, my mom brought her natural history books,&#8221; Anderson says. Her mother also grew native plants at home. While this exposure started Anderson down the path of natural history research as a geochemist, she was excited to return as a retiree to what prompted her love for nature in the first place&#8212;studying and protecting California native plants.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a volunteer coordinator at the Arboretum, Anderson leads two volunteer groups during the week: one on Tuesday morning tending the California Native Garden in the front of the arboretum and another on Thursday morning with the Conservation Garden in the upper section of the Arboretum. The volunteers are a mix of undergraduates, an enthusiastic computer&#160; science masters student, and retirees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While her Tuesday volunteer group maintains the front-facing Native California Garden, Anderson has more creative license to start new projects in the Conservation Garden. In the last few years, Anderson established a coastal prairie habitat. Inspired by the Upper Marshall Meadow near her Felton home, she took seeds from endangered plants that only exist in the Upper Marshall Meadow to propagate and plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Coastal prairies are the most endangered plant community. I think they are spectacular, especially in spring when there are lots of flowers,&#8221; Anderson says. In the first year of the project, she planted two rare species from the meadow and was ecstatic to see them seed out the next year, solidifying the plants&#8217; longevity in the garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love the people I work with and who oversee me,&#8221; she says referring to the seven paid staff at the Arboretum. &#8220;The wonderful thing about this place is its staff. Not only do they appreciate volunteers, but they are very supportive&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arboretum staff are always there to provide tools and frequently greet volunteers by name, lifting them up. She says she feels like she is treated like staff because of her long-time involvement and the expertise she brings to the arboretum. There are many ways that people can volunteer at the garden from weeding and pruning plants to working at the gift shop and talking to visitors about the garden. Volunteers can come on a weekly basis or simply come to a singular event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is something for everyone here,&#8221; Anderson says.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her passion for plants and the Arboretum, Anderson is a staunch supporter of students at UC Santa Cruz. She has established scholarships in memory of her parents, Marilyn</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">C. and Raymond E. Davis as well as made other generous gifts to the university. Her roots are indeed deep at UC Santa Cruz.</span></i></p>

With its primary color palette, asymmetrical buildings nestled in the redwoods on the north side of UCSC&#8217;s campus, and strong emphasis on student-driven, interdisciplinary education, Kresge did not look, act, or function like any other academic community in the country. Kresge&#8217;s architecture&#8212;designed as an avant-garde Italian village by famed postmodernists Charles Moore and William Turnbull of Moore Lyndon Turnbull Whitaker&#8212;brought the college&#8217;s essence to life.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty years later, Kresge continues to be a close-knit living and learning community focused on creativity, sustainability, and social justice, simultaneously promoting experimentation and experiential learning.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its buildings, however, have not fared as well. The Kresge Renewal, a renovation and expansion project designed by noted architect and MacArthur Fellow Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang Architects, is bringing the college&#8217;s aging infrastructure up to date, upgrading beloved landmarks, and adding new buildings that will continue Kresge&#8217;s forward-looking legacy by being more responsive to student needs&#8212;now and for the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The project preserves the college&#8217;s identity and deep sense of community, while also making it more welcoming and accessible to all students,&#8221; says Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;It has been exciting to see the project go from concept to reality. I can&#8217;t wait to see it unveiled to our community this fall. It&#8217;s absolutely gorgeous.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>A renewed space for living and learning</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge&#8217;s new spaces&#8212;designed with sustainability and accessibility in mind&#8212;will enable students to connect, create, innovate, and flourish.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new 35,000-square-foot academic building, opening this fall, will house multiple departments and faculty offices, affirming the college as a scholarly space as well as a residential one. Students, faculty, and the campus community will benefit from multipurpose classrooms, study lounges, a state-of-the-art computer lab, and a 600-person lecture hall&#8212;the largest on campus&#8212;for events and performances. The treasured Kresge Town Hall being rebuilt on the south end of the college alongside an outdoor plaza will open in fall 2025.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three new residence halls are also opening this fall and will be home to 400 students, helping to alleviate campus housing pressures. Themed floors in each of the halls, including a Writer&#8217;s House and Ecovillage, will gather students together in intimate intellectual and social communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The existing Kresge buildings are being renovated and reconstructed to provide 590 beds by fall 2025.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We sited the new residential halls to open up to the spectacular natural environment and not interfere with the original Kresge College buildings,&#8221; says Jolie Kerns, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Director of Physical and Environmental Planning.&#160; &#8220;Then, by analyzing the historic buildings, we were able to find creative ways to add more beds and further support the dynamic academic and student life programs that are so vital for the College, while retaining the spirit of the original architecture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A remodeled Writing Center, slated to open in 2025, will become a hub for student-driven experiential learning, with co-ops, working groups, and other student-faculty &#8220;co-labs&#8221; that empower students to put into practice the lessons they are learning in the classroom. The remodeled North Bridge, now accessible to people of all abilities, will connect Kresge to the rest of the UCSC campus, and help facilitate foot traffic to the west side of campus.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Investing in tomorrow</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kresge has always been an extraordinary living-learning community. The Kresge Renewal draws on the college&#8217;s unique past as it helps equip students with the skills, knowledge, and space they need to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of the 21st century. Campus, state, and federal funds jump-started the project. There is additional opportunity for donors to support the renewal by providing resources for the construction of the new Town Hall and by contributing to Kresge&#8217;s endowment to fund experiential learning programs for students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A revitalized Kresge College will launch a new generation of creators and changemakers,&#8221; says Kresge Provost Mayanthi Fernando. &#8220;We are grateful to the generous individuals who have partnered with us as we advance our vision, and we invite others to join us in building a Kresge for the future.&#8221;</span></p>

While these older models work well with limited data, they struggle with the huge seismology datasets that are now available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address this limitation, a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Technical University of Munich created a new model that uses deep learning to forecast aftershocks:&#160; the Recurrent Earthquake foreCAST (RECAST). In a <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL103909">paper published </a></span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL103909"><span style="font-weight: 400;">today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL103909"> in Geophysical Research Letters</a>, the scientists show how the deep learning model is more flexible and scalable than the earthquake forecasting models currently used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new model outperformed the current model, known as the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, for earthquake catalogs of about 10,000 events and greater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ETAS model approach was designed for the observations that we had in the 80s and 90s when we were trying to build reliable forecasts based on very few observations,&#8221; said Kelian Dascher-Cousineau, the lead author of the paper who recently completed his PhD at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very different landscape today.&#8221; Now, with more sensitive equipment and larger data storage capabilities, earthquake catalogs are much larger and more detailed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve started to have million-earthquake catalogs, and the old model simply couldn&#8217;t handle that amount of data,&#8221; said Emily Brodsky, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and co-author on the paper. In fact, one of the main challenges of the study was not designing the new RECAST model itself but getting the older ETAS model to work on huge data sets in order to compare the two.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ETAS model is kind of brittle, and it has a lot of very subtle and finicky ways in which it can fail,&#8221; said Dascher-Cousineau. &#8220;So, we spent a lot of time making sure we weren&#8217;t messing up our benchmark compared to actual model development.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To continue applying deep learning models to aftershock forecasting, Dascher-Cousineau says the field needs a better system for benchmarking. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the RECAST model, the group first used an ETAS model to simulate an earthquake catalog. After working with the synthetic data, the researchers tested the RECAST model using real data from the Southern California earthquake catalog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found that the RECAST model &#8212; which can, essentially, learn how to learn &#8212; performed slightly better than the ETAS model at forecasting aftershocks, particularly as the amount of data increased. The computational effort and time were also significantly better for larger catalogs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time scientists have tried using machine learning to forecast earthquakes, but until recently, the technology was not quite ready, said Dascher-Cousineau. New advances in machine learning make the RECAST model more accurate and easily adaptable to different earthquake catalogs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model&#8217;s flexibility could open up new possibilities for earthquake forecasting. With the ability to adapt to large amounts of new data, models that use deep learning could potentially incorporate information from multiple regions at once to make better forecasts about poorly studied areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We might be able to train on New Zealand, Japan, California and have a model that's actually quite good for forecasting somewhere where the data might not be as abundant,&#8221; said Dascher-Cousineau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using deep-learning models will also eventually allow researchers to expand the type of data they use to forecast seismicity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re recording ground motion all the time,&#8221; said Brodsky. &#8220;So the next level is to actually use all of that information, not worry about whether we&#8217;re calling it an earthquake or not an earthquake but to use everything."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the researchers hope the model sparks discussions about the possibilities of the new technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It has all of this potential associated with it,&#8221; said Dascher-Cousineau. &#8220;Because it is designed that way.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9a0785a58072704653a8eb25270df1b1"><name>arivu-concert-feature-dan-white</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Arivu, the massively popular and groundbreaking Indian rapper, will play an intimate outdoor show at UCSC’s Quarry Amphitheater, presented by the Center For South Asian Studies </title><summary>Arivu, the  Indian rapper, singer, and social activist whose image appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone India magazine, is playing a highly anticipated free concert at the Quarry Amphitheater at UCSC at 8 p.m. on Saturday, October 7. </summary><start-date>1694801400000</start-date><display-name>arivuUCSCquarry</display-name><path>/2023/08/arivu-concert-feature-dan-white</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/08/arivu-concert-feature-dan-white</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1694801298836</created-on><last-modified-by>sjorda</last-modified-by><last-modified>1695064100184</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/inthenews/2023/08/arivu-poster.jpg</path><link>site://news/inthenews/2023/08/arivu-poster.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arivu-poster.jpg</name><display-name>arivu-poster.jpg</display-name><file-size>106084</file-size><width>400</width><height>618</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/inthenews/2023/08/arivu-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/inthenews/2023/08/arivu-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>arivu-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>arivu-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>21490</file-size><width>80</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through his rebellious singles such as &#8216;Anti-Indian,&#8217; &#8216;Kalla Mouni,&#8217; and &#8216;Sanda Seivom,&#8217; Arivu is known as a prodigal talent with the guts to speak truth to power.&#160;</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Arivu, born Arivarasu Kalainesan, rose to international fame with his hit Tamil song “Enjoy Enjaami,” a collaboration with the singer Dhee that has amassed half a billion views on YouTube.

Doors open that evening at 7 p.m. The concert is being presented by the Center For South Asian Studies (CSAS) at UC Santa Cruz. </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/event/ambassa-in-america-featuring-arivu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advance registration is required for concert attendees.&#160;</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arivu, born Arivarasu Kalainesan, rose to international fame with his hit Tamil song &#8220;Enjoy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjaami,&#8221; a collaboration with the singer Dhee that has amassed half a billion views on YouTube. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an online magazine, described the single as &#8220;one step closer to annihilating caste&#8221; in India. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its cover story on Arivu, which ran in the August 2021 issue, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling Stone </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">described him as &#8220;the voice of socio-political hip hop, smashing records and defying social norms.&#8221; The magazine also called him &#8220;the Tamil artist (who) has scorched a path out, raising his voice against systemic injustices.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through his rebellious singles such as &#8216;Anti-Indian,&#8217; &#8216;Kalla Mouni,&#8217; and &#8216;Sanda Seivom,&#8217; Arivu is known as a prodigal talent with the guts to speak truth to power.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the UCSC concert, Arivu will lead members of his Ambassa band, an experiment in bringing together the western elements of hip-hop, beat boxing and rock with the native sounds of Folk, Gaana, and Oppari. &#8220;Ambassa&#8217;s mission is to showcase the need for justice in an increasingly divided India, through the transformative as well as rousing powers of music,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Professor of Feminist Studies Anjali Arondekar, founding director for the Center For South Asian Studies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arivu is a member of the Dalit caste, traditionally considered &#8220;untouchable&#8221; under India&#8217;s rigid caste system, which was officially outlawed after the country&#8217;s independence from Great Britain, yet remains omnipresent. Scholars who research caste-oppression contend that </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2023/3/8/the-dalit-mothers-who-were-forced-to-become-wet-nurses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caste-based discrimination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains common within the South Asian diasporic populations in the United States and elsewhere. Arondekar said Arivu&#8217;s strong anti-caste discrimination message is especially important in light of the fact that the California State Legislature passed a landmark bill this month, SB 403, banning discrimination based on caste. If it is signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, California will be the first state in the U.S. to ban caste-based discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Si</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nce its launch in 2019, the CSAS has curated conversations and collaborations focusing on histories of justice, economic precarity and authoritarianism marked by caste, religion, gender, region, and labor segmentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of the CSAS&#8217;s efforts remains the enduring question of the marginalized life-worlds within which minoritized collectivities survive, resist, refuse and sometimes surrender. The CSAS&#8217;s faculty and broader scholarly networks are uniquely poised to engage with the difficult questions of caste, gender, and religion.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our faculty are at the forefront of new scholarship on caste injustice, secularism, and feminist struggles, and regularly participate in broader public facing projects on such issues,&#8221; Arondekar noted. &#8220;We also have established connections with the extensive network of NGOs and public initiatives focused on justice in South Asia in the Bay Area.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arondekar, the Arivu concert is a way for the CSAS to highlight its commitment to justice in a high-profile way, with a special appeal to UCSC&#8217;s undergraduate population, which includes a large number of students of South Asian descent.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The CSAS wanted to do something out of the box,&#8221; she said, &#8220;not just a talk and a lecture but an event that brought a special energy and excitement to campus. My hope is that this concert will draw in folks from across campus and our broader Santa Cruz community who care about issues of justice. We want everyone to join us as we educate, agitate, and organize through the rousing music of Arivu and the Ambassa Band.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the CSAS&#8217;s mission, Arivu&#8217;s performance could not be more timely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arivu concert is made possible by the generosity of donors Kamil and Talat Hasan, who have provided foundational support for the CSAS, and the Anuradha Luther Maitra and Thomas Kailath Program Endowment for the CSAS, which is also contributing to the concert. Kamil Hasan and Anuradha Luther Maitra are UC Santa Cruz Foundation Trustees.</span></p>
