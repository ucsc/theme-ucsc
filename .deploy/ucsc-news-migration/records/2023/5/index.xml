<p>While carbon dioxide is often the focus of greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategies, methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane" rel="noopener" target="_blank">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</a> The new committee, which met for the first time in Washington, D.C., in April, is tasked with developing a research agenda to address the critical issue of methane removal to combat climate change.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The role of methane emissions in climate change is critically important, as is the timing of this report,&#8221; said Jinnah. &#8220;In contrast to some other climate intervention strategies, where technology development has gotten out ahead of assessment of equity and justice, this committee&#8217;s report will be an early intervention and an opportunity to ensure science and justice goals are developed in tandem.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November 2021, the U.S. joined a <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022/the-global-methane-pledge" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global pledge</a> to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. The reduction is a vital component of the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paris Agreement</a>, which aims to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5&#176;C.</p>
<p>The committee's goal is to develop a research program that will bring to light critical questions for governance in emerging technologies for methane removal and anticipate its future developments.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at an early stage of methane removal technology development and the right moment to be thoughtful and considered about prioritizing research that may yield climate response options that are both effective and equitable. It&#8217;s crucial that we respond to environmental justice concerns in a proactive rather than reactive manner,&#8221; said Jinnah.&#160;</p>
<p>Jinnah, who <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/jinnah-harvard-advisory-committee.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">co-chairs Harvard University&#8217;s Advisory Committee for the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx)</a>, was chosen in part due to her relevant experience in governance of other emerging technologies, such as solar geoengineering.</p>
<p>The ClimateWorks Foundation is sponsoring the NASEM committee's work. They will meet monthly, and Jinnah will serve as a member for at least 18 months.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dd11c6dd8072704657950860b8a61edc"><name>dande-town-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Second Decarbonization &amp; Electrification Town Hall Meeting</title><summary>Join us next week for the Decarbonization &amp; Electrification (D&amp;E) Task Force's second town hall gathering.</summary><start-date>1683010800000</start-date><path>/2023/05/dande-town-hall</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/dande-town-hall</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1683041142477</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1683041175765</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pioadm5@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us next week for the</span> <a href="https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/initiatives/decarb-electrific.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decarbonization &amp; Electrification (D&amp;E) Task Force's</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> second town hall gathering.

Monday was Chief Domby&#8217;s first day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domby comes to UCSC after 23 years with the California Highway Patrol. He started and now finishes his career in the Santa Cruz area. Rising through the ranks, he has served as an officer, sergeant, lieutenant, supervisor and acting commander and&#160; collaborated with local, state and federal agencies in areas such as community outreach, emergency response and incident command.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before going into law enforcement, Domby had a career in education as a high school teacher and college instructor at two community colleges. He taught on and off campus and also at a correctional facility. He also held the position of transfer coordinator and admissions officer at the Maryland Institute College of Arts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domby received a Bachelor of Arts in Art Education from Virginia Wesleyan College and a Masters in Fine Art in Studio Art, Art Education from Radford University.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using his combined experience in higher education and law enforcement, he is looking forward to building an inclusive and collaborative public safety environment within the department and across campus.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domby has received commendations for Outstanding Performance, Exceptional Performance, Investigative Commitment and he was named Officer of the Year twice while working in the Clear Lake area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to thank Mary Garcia&#160; and Greg Flippo who have served as interim chiefs for more than two years. Taking over after the retirement of Chief Nader Oweis, they have provided strong leadership through challenging times and worked closely with campus partners to re-envision campus safety. We are grateful for their willingness to lead the organization through this leadership transition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also would like to thank the search advisory committee members, especially Chair David Keller, for their work in reviewing and interviewing the candidates. We had a strong group of finalists. Thank you, as well, to the many in our campus community who engaged with us in the search process and provided valuable feedback. The input was extremely helpful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please join me in welcoming Kevin Domby to UC Santa Cruz and to his new post as Chief of Police.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Clement Stokes, AVC Risk and Safety Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dd93872d807270465795086053be2ba6"><name>domby-intro</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Meet UCSC’s new Chief of Police Kevin Domby </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz’s newly appointed Executive Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police Kevin Domby credits his high school art teacher with introducing him to the idea of a career in public service.

"Throughout my career, whether it was when I was a teacher or as a peace officer, I've enjoyed mentoring, training and teaching," Domby said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domby grew up in southwestern Virginia, a rural area separated from the rest of the state by the Appalachian Mountains. Few high school graduates attended college and instead went to work in the coal or agricultural industries. As the first in his family to consider going to college, he faced many challenges. That dream started solidifying through the guidance of his art teacher, who had graduated from Virginia Wesleyan College (VWC), now Virginia Wesleyan University. &#8220;He drove me to Virginia Beach to visit VWC, took me to the admissions office and introduced me to faculty in the art department.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domby decided to follow his mentor&#8217;s path and enrolled in VWC, where he got a degree in art education and received his K-12 teaching certificate. He then pursued a master&#8217;s in fine arts at Radford University and worked as a graduate teaching assistant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating, Domby worked as an admission counselor and transfer coordinator at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). He traveled the country reviewing student portfolios, providing guidance, evaluating transcripts of transfer students and making admission recommendations. &#8220;My own college experience and time working at MICA gave me invaluable insights into the challenges faced by students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domby spent almost a decade teaching art, first as a high school art instructor and department chair in suburban Baltimore, Maryland. He later became an adjunct instructor and then a full-time instructor at the Baltimore County Community College (BCCC). His work at BCCC included teaching art to men incarcerated at the Jessup Correctional Facility. &#8220;The work at Jessup had a profound impact on me and opened my eyes to the life and challenges of the incarcerated.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While teaching, he continued to pursue his personal art career. He was commissioned to create public art projects for several businesses. He participated in juried and solo art exhibits until 1999 when Domby decided to make a career change and follow in his brother&#8217;s footsteps. He joined the California Highway Patrol (CHP).</span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you make such a significant career change?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had reached a point in teaching where I&#8217;d achieved my goal of being a full-time college instructor, but I always admired the public service my brother was doing as a CHP officer. Over the years, during my visits with him and while riding with him during his shift, I was impacted by the essential public safety and service the CHP provided to the community. I came to want to be a part of that service and, with the support of my wife, brother, and family, began my second career, which, in a roundabout way, has led me to UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m tremendously excited to merge the lessons and skill sets I&#8217;ve learned in both of my careers to serve the UCSC campus.&#160;&#160;</span><strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Looking across your career with the CHP, what are you most proud of?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pride myself on ensuring both myself and those I was in charge of leading provided service to the community that was respectful, professional, ethical and done with integrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was blessed to have served in a variety of assignments where I experienced first-hand the importance of the CHP as an essential organization in the community, especially in a time of crisis, tragedy and need. &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the individual connections with the public that I found most rewarding and important</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; Those interactions don&#8217;t just happen. They are the result of a commitment to service and the profession.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts about how policing is carried out today and the opportunities we have for change?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities across the nation, including the UCSC community, deserve an approach to public safety that is always respectful, professional, accountable and responsive to the concerns and needs of the community.&#160; Earning community trust on a daily basis through a commitment to ongoing communication, collaboration and input is the way forward.

<p><strong>What would you like the UCSC community to know about how you lead?&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humility is an essential part of being a leader. You've got to have an open door, an open mind and an open heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a coach/mentor leader. I enjoy working alongside people and supporting them. It&#8217;s cliche to say you lead by example, but I find participating in the work that those you're leading are doing allows you insight to help guide them or provide resources so that they can do their job better.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who understands the creative process and input from all angles, I&#8217;m able to break down a problem and then identify what resources, people and processes solve it. That way, the solution is one that has been vetted by community members or the people responsible for implementing it.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dda434958072704657950860b7306d28"><name>united-way-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz and United Way invest in youth perspective in researching mental health throughout local communities </title><summary>Beginning in early 2021, UC Santa Cruz partnered with the United Way of Santa Cruz County’s Youth Action Network, seeking to support youth empowerment and leadership.

Now, local experts in higher education and the nonprofit sphere have banded together to empower young people to decide on and delve into that topic area across Santa Cruz County.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/04/institutional-challenge-grant.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in early 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the University of California, Santa Cruz partnered with the </span><a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Way of Santa Cruz County&#8217;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Youth Action Network, seeking to support youth empowerment and leadership. By way of a three-year, $650,000 grant, the partners have continued pushing forward with their research project goals, with UC Santa Cruz faculty and undergraduates working with local high school and middle school students in Watsonville, Scotts Valley and Live Oak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of that vital work, the partners were recognized as the United Way Partner of the Year last Friday, April 28th, at </span><a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/united-4-youth-celebration-awards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the United 4 Youth Celebration &amp; Awards Ceremony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Hotel Paradox. The sold-out event, formerly called the Community Builders Awards, sought to recognize and celebrate the outstanding United Way Champions committed to youth well-being and success in Santa Cruz County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca London, associate professor of sociology, is the project lead at UC Santa Cruz, and works alongside Steve McKay, associate professor of sociology and the director for the Center for Labor and Community, and Regina Langhout, professor of psychology. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As London described, the organizations came together in 2020 to develop a research project, which would elevate youth voices and leadership: &#8220;This was a change for United Way, after CEO Keisha Browder took the helm&#8230;Keisha wanted to create a new vision for how United Way would interact with the community.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another impetus for the organizations&#8217; collaboration was the connection with a former student of McKay, Gabriela Sanchez Ramirez. Sanchez Ramirez had previously participated in a community-engaged research project on affordable housing back in 2018, called </span><a href="https://noplacelikehome.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Place Like Home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and soon thereafter began working for United Way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those shared relationships and vision in mind, the partners built a proposal for grant funding and continued to generate a research agenda that was directly determined by and useful to local community organizations. From there, London says they worked to identify and bring together up to 60 youth countywide to develop the research project on a topic they felt was important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students chose to focus on mental health, naming the leadership group </span><a href="https://www.unitedwaysc.org/jovenes-sanos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">J&#243;venes Sanos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Langhout said the youth had an expansive understanding of mental health: &#8220;The youth wanted to talk about everything from the challenges of income and housing instability, to immigration raids, to how institutions in the county support us. They linked all of these issues to mental health and community well-being.&#8221; &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students looked to conduct their research through a community-wide survey, which launched in late March and early April 2023. The students developed the survey with Langhout and UC Santa Cruz undergraduates in fall quarter 2021 and winter quarter 2022, and McKay&#8217;s spring quarter seminar is connecting with the students to go out into the field for surveying and data collection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the team aims to receive 1,000 responses; thus far, students have garnered over 364 responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the United Way side, Director of Community Impact Sarah Emmert oversees the project as a community fellow, with four UC Santa Cruz research fellows sharing further insights. McKay said that that level of collaboration with United Way makes the process better for everyone: &#8220;It makes the research better because the community and organization are directly involved in guiding the research and analyzing the results&#8230;this can be really and truly research and data led.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Gamban, Resource Development &amp; Marketing Manager for United Way, said the partnership and research thus far has helped to highlight youth voice. Pamela Velazquez, Senior Community Impact Manager for United Way, agrees that the work thus far demonstrates just how imperative it is to have these students, many of whom are BIPOC and first-generation youth, at the forefront of the research efforts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of our main goals is to support the students in seeing themselves in higher education and bridge the gap between South County and UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Velazquez said. &#8220;It will be really exciting to see what systemic shifts we can make in the community from our data collection.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project&#8217;s funding comes from the highly-competitive </span><a href="https://wtgrantfoundation.org/three-new-institutional-challenge-grants-to-encourage-partnerships-spur-community-engaged-research-and-reduce-inequality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutional Challenge Grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, supported by the William T. Grant Foundation, Spencer Foundation, and Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The grants aim to assist universities and community organizations to work together to reduce equity and access for youth populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project helped to establish </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/work/campus-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Campus + Community center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2022-23 school year, with London serving as its Faculty Director. The center is dedicated to supporting ethical and mutually beneficial engaged scholarship at UC Santa Cruz.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the project&#8217;s future, Dr. Saskias Casanova of the Psychology department and Dr. Jessica Taft of the Latin American &amp; Latino Studies department will take over the project with their courses to help local youth in disseminating the findings and advocating for change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As London shared, the partnership since initially coming together with United Way in 2020 has been rewarding, and the UC Santa Cruz team is deeply grateful for having the chance to work with United Way on this important research mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to make it so that youth are empowered to go out and do this kind of research,&#8221; London said. &#8220;By reflecting on this project and process, we&#8217;ll be able to improve this work and continue to do it better in every iteration moving forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As McKay said, &#8220;we&#8217;re looking forward to the action phase, and to make the research as actionable and useful as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This partnership is going to keep generating deeper relations and deeper projects, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s exciting about the long-term relationships between all of us,&#8221; he said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ddca15228072704657950860a4a37323"><name>naloxone-available-on-campu</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Fentanyl Awareness Day is May 9</title><summary>Tuesday, May 9 marks the second annual national Fentanyl Awareness Day.

The deep neural network he developed classifies particle signals with 99.8 percent accuracy in real time, on a system that is relatively cheap and portable for point-of-care applications, as shown in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31694-6">new paper</a> in Nature Scientific Reports.&#160;<br/><br/>When taking biomarker detectors into the field or a point-of-care setting such as a health clinic, the signals received by the sensors may not be as high quality as those in a lab or a controlled environment. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as the need to use cheaper chips to bring down costs, or environmental characteristics such as temperature and humidity.&#160;<br/><br/>To address the challenges of a weak signal, Schmidt and his team developed a deep neural network that can identify the source of that weak signal with high confidence. The researchers trained the neural network with known training signals, teaching it to recognize potential variations it could see, so that it can recognize patterns and identify new signals with very high accuracy.&#160;<br/><br/>First, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28703-z">parallel cluster wavelet analysis (PCWA) approach</a> designed in Schmidt&#8217;s lab detects that a signal is present. Then, the neural network processes the potentially weak or noisy signal, identifying its source. This system works in real time, so users are able to receive results in a fraction of a second.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about making the most of possibly low quality signals, and doing that really fast and efficiently,&#8221; Schmidt said.&#160;<br/><br/>A smaller version of the neural network model can run on portable devices. In the paper, the researchers run the system over a Google Coral Dev board, a relatively cheap edge device for accelerated execution of artificial intelligence algorithms. This means the system also requires less power to execute the processing compared to other techniques.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Unlike some research that requires running on supercomputers to do high-accuracy detection, we proved that even a compact, portable, relatively cheap device can do the job for us,&#8221; Ganjalizadeh said. &#8220;It makes it available, feasible, and portable for point-of-care applications.&#8221;<br/><br/>The entire system is designed to be used completely locally, meaning the data processing can happen without internet access, unlike other systems that rely on cloud computing. This also provides a data security advantage, because results can be produced without the need to share data with a cloud server provider.&#160;<br/><br/>It is also designed to be able to give results on a mobile device, eliminating the need to bring a laptop into the field.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;You can build a more robust system that you could take out to under-resourced or less- developed regions, and it still works,&#8221; Schmidt said.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>This improved system will work for any other biomarkers Schmidt&#8217;s lab&#8217;s systems have been used to detect in the past, such as COVID-19, Ebola, flu, and cancer biomarkers. Although they are currently focused on medical applications, the system could potentially be adapted for the detection of any type of signal.&#160;<br/><br/>To push the technology further, Schmidt and his lab members plan to add even more dynamic signal processing capabilities to their devices. This will simplify the system and combine the processing techniques needed to detect signals at both low and high concentrations of molecules. The team is also working to bring discrete parts of the setup into the integrated design of the optofluidic chip.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="decdda338072704638971de83e889c6b"><name>brodsky-nas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Geoscientist Emily Brodsky elected to the National Academy of Sciences</title><summary>Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of her distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.</summary><start-date>1683097200000</start-date><display-name>Geoscientist Emily Brodsky elected to the National Academy of Sciences</display-name><path>/2023/05/brodsky-nas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/brodsky-nas</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1683070245409</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1683124891289</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>emily-brodsky-350.jpg</name><display-name>emily-brodsky-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>110199</file-size><width>350</width><height>393</height></image><image-alt>Emily Brodsky</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2022/07/images/emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>emily-brodsky-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28606</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Emily Brodsky</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Emily Brodsky (photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Emily Brodsky, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of her distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.</p>
<p>Brodsky joins 12 other UCSC faculty (including four others in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences) who are members of the academy, one of the highest honors a U.S. scientist can receive. The new members also include several UCSC alumni, including Danesh Moazed (Ph.D. biology &#8217;89, B.A. biology &#8217;85), Pamela Silver (B.A. chemistry &#8217;74), and Gia Voeltz (B.S. biochemistry and molecular biology &#8217;94).</p>
<p>Brodsky&#8217;s research focuses on the mechanics underlying earthquakes, addressing questions about the processes that trigger earthquakes and the constraining forces and processes that occur inside a fault zone during slip. She currently chairs the steering committee of <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/11/subduction-zone-report.html">SZ4D</a>, an ambitious coordinated research initiative to investigate the processes that underlie subduction zone hazards.</p>
<p>After the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake off the coast of Japan, Brodsky helped organize and lead a major international expedition to study the fault. Her recent work includes important findings about earthquakes induced by human activities in which fluids are injected deep underground (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, wastewater disposal, and geothermal wells).</p>
<p>Brodsky has served on the boards of directors of the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) and the Incorporated Research Institutes for Seismology (IRIS). A fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the Geological Society of America (GSA), she has received many awards and honors for her work, including most recently the 2021 Price Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and the 2022 Nemmers Prize in Earth Sciences. She joined the UCSC faculty in 2005.</p>
<p>The new members of the National Academy of Sciences will be formally inducted next year at the 2024 NAS Annual Meeting.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e29935bc8072704638971de8057a0e94"><name>ed-qb3</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Ed Green named QB3-Santa Cruz Scientific Director</title><summary>Richard (Ed) Green, professor of biomolecular engineering, has been selected to serve as the next director of the California Institute of Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1683129600000</start-date><path>/2023/05/ed-qb3</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/ed-qb3</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1683133904298</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1683133904298</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Appointments</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/ed_400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/ed_400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ed_400.jpg</name><display-name>ed_400.jpg</display-name><file-size>27800</file-size><width>400</width><height>290</height></image><image-alt>Ed Green in a lab coat, with test tubes and other lab equipment</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/ed_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/ed_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ed_80.jpg</name><display-name>ed_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>5992</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ed Green in a lab coat, with test tubes and other lab equipment</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Ed Green is&#160;an expert in paleogenomics and forensic genomics and has launched several startups in these areas.

QB3 has centers at UC Santa Cruz, Berkeley, and San Francisco and operates in collaboration with private industry and venture capital.<br/><br/>&#8220;The opportunities in biotechnology are enormous,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;QB3 has been at the forefront, fostering the connections that aim UCSC technology at important problems. I&#8217;m looking forward to expanding the impact of QB3 in Santa Cruz and beyond.&#8221;<br/><br/>Green is an expert in paleogenomics and forensic genomics. His research has led to breakthrough discoveries about human evolution, such as the mixing between the earliest modern humans and Neanderthals. He is the co-principal investigator of the <a href="https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/index.html">UCSC Paleogenomics Lab</a>, a collaborative venture with Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Beth Shapiro that uses ancient DNA to investigate mysteries in genome and species evolution.<br/><br/>He is the co-founder and scientific advisor of <a href="https://www.astreaforensics.com/">Astrea Forensics</a>, which takes on difficult-to-solve forensic casework and the identification of human remains through the application of ancient DNA techniques and direct genome sequencing. Green pioneered a technique that can sequence DNA from rootless hair, a previously impossible feat that has ultimately led to the solving of many cold cases and closure for the families of victims.&#160;<br/><br/>Green has founded two startup companies through QB3 at UCSC. <a href="https://dovetailgenomics.com/">Dovetail Genomics</a>, which began as a startup on the UCSC campus and later moved to Scotts Valley, uses specialized methods for various complex genomics projects and is now part of Cantata Bio. <a href="https://www.claretbio.com/">Claret Biosciences</a> builds next-generation sequencing library preparation and analysis tools that empower a deeper understanding of degraded DNA molecules, particularly cancer-derived molecules.&#160;<br/><br/>Green earned a B.S. in genetics at the University of Georgia, Athens, and a Ph.D. in molecular and cell biology, with an emphasis in computational and genomic biology, at UC Berkeley. He joined the faculty of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz in January 2010 and is also affiliated with the departments of anthropology and molecular, cell, and developmental biology.&#160;<br/><br/>Green will succeed Distinguished Professor of Biomolecular Engineering David Haussler, who has served in the position since QB3 was established in 2000.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e848ecc5807270460b2210d13fa9b56e"><name>regional-food-center</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Center for Agroecology will support new USDA Regional Food Business Center</title><summary>The University of California, Santa Cruz will support the establishment of a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Regional Food Business Center to support resilient food systems.</summary><start-date>1683183600000</start-date><path>/2023/05/regional-food-center</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/regional-food-center</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1683229306033</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1683229334852</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Erin Foley</name><title></title><phone/><email>eefoley@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/20191104-farm-field-harvest-f-004</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/20191104-farm-field-harvest-f-004</link><site>news</site><name>20191104-farm-field-harvest-f-004</name><display-name>20191104-farm-field-harvest-f-004</display-name><file-size>211817</file-size></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/20191104-farm-field-harvest-ef-004-copy</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/20191104-farm-field-harvest-ef-004-copy</link><site>news</site><name>20191104-farm-field-harvest-ef-004-copy</name><display-name>20191104-farm-field-harvest-ef-004-copy</display-name><file-size>25114</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By strengthening connections between rural and urban areas, the Regional Food Business Centers will drive economic opportunities across the region, creating a more diversified and resilient food system.</span></p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California, Santa Cruz will support the establishment of a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Regional Food Business Center to support resilient food systems by providing coordination, technical assistance, and capacity building to help farmers, ranchers, and other food businesses access new markets and navigate federal, state, and local resources, thereby closing the gaps to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new center is one of 12 Regional Food Business Centers the USDA will establish to serve all areas of the country, including U.S. territories. The Regional Food Business Centers will provide producers with assistance in accessing a variety of markets, including linking small and mid-size producers to wholesalers and distributors. In addition, the centers will connect growers to resources including educational workshops and technical assistance providers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional Food Centers will target their work to historically underinvested communities in their region. By strengthening connections between rural and urban areas, the Regional Food Business Centers will drive economic opportunities across the region, creating a more diversified and resilient food system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Regional Food Business Centers, along with investments through the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure Program will create new and expanded local market opportunities which will improve farm income, create good paying jobs and build greater resilience in our overall food system,&#8221; said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources (UC ANR) will lead the establishment of a Southwest USDA Regional Food Business Center to serve California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. The $35 million project will have a particular focus on the Colonias communities &#8211; communities within the mainly rural U.S.-Mexico border region with marginal conditions related to housing and infrastructure &#8211; of southern Arizona and California. (See </span><a href="https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/United-States-Mexico-Border-Region-Map.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colonia-Community-Map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at </span><a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hudexchange.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California (UC) will provide technical assistance throughout California through its Cooperative Extension programs, consisting of the Small Farms Program, Regional Food Systems, Urban Agriculture Program, Community and Economic Development Network, and UC campus-based subject matter experts covering food safety, economics and cooperatives. The new Regional Food Business Center will diversify California&#8217;s food system by equitably growing new businesses owned by underserved and historically underrepresented communities throughout both rural and urban areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is so exciting to see 16 organizations, across four states, coming together with us to enhance and expand much-needed business support services to our food and farm businesses,&#8221; said Glenda Humiston, UC vice president for agriculture and natural resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz Center for Agroecology will support the Southwest Regional Food Business Center with a focus on serving the North Bay and Central Coast, consisting of the counties of Mendocino, Sonoma, Contra Costa, Solana, San Francisco, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Regional Food Center represents a collaborative and comprehensive regional partnership between USDA, UC, and local organizations to catalyze regional growth that will strengthen the region's food economies, improve agri-food supply chain resilience, and center equity in regional food systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, the Center for Agroecology has led efforts to advance market opportunities and viability of small- and mid-scale specialty crop producers through technical training, capacity building, and the development of applied practitioner publications that have been disseminated across the state, country, and internationally.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education and Research Specialist Tim Galarneau, who will lead the Center for Agroecology&#8217;s support of the new Food Business Center, facilitated the development and implementation of a range of farm to institution efforts across schools, universities, and hospitals. Galarneau&#8217;s past efforts included advancing the development and implementation of&#160; systemwide sustainable food sourcing guidelines for the UC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year the UC shifted more than $28 million annually in sustainable sourcing that includes supporting small and midscale socially-disadvantaged producers across specialty crops, livestock, and fisheries.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galarneau emphasized, &#8220;It&#8217;s an exciting time to deepen our region&#8217;s food and farming partnerships while leveraging the support of USDA Agricultural Marketing Service and the emerging multi-state Center to strengthen the economic viability and long term priority of a food system that supports our producers, sustains the land, and nourishes communities.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building upon this work, the Center for Agroecology will collaborate with community-based organizations to facilitate technical assistance for farmers and others working in the food system and share resources, training, and materials available through UC ANR to strengthen food safety, integrate technology, and enhance institutional market access.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is an amazing opportunity for the Center for Agroecology to support and collaborate more closely with the extremely successful community-based organizations in our region,&#8221; said Darryl Wong, executive director of the Center for Agroecology. &#8220;These organizations have been working tirelessly to support underrepresented growers for decades and bringing USDA&#8217;s institutional support to their efforts is essential for achieving broad based outcomes.&#8221;</span></p>

These acts are abhorrent and antithetical to our values and commitment to access to higher education. This incident is being addressed through our conduct processes according to our policies and procedures, but I know that no response can undo the harm felt by so many in our community.<br/><br/>When these acts occur, we must condemn them and respond swiftly, but we also must not allow them or those responsible to create division in our community or undermine our values. Antisemitism has no place, here or anywhere. The Jewish community is an integral part of our campus community. Such acts are designed to drown out the good work of so many by the antagonism and hatred of a few.<br/><br/>Faced with this hatred, I call on our broader community to transform our outrage into uplift and to support our Jewish friends, family, and community members today and each day. Rather than allowing hate to have the last word, we can voice together full-throated support for our Jewish community.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she was 13 years old,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UCSC alumna Alyssa Scarsciotti (Stevenson &#8217;20, Sociology and Linguistics)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">dreamed of joining the Peace Corps. This dream is now a reality: she is part of the first cohort of Peace Corps volunteers to return to overseas service since the service network&#8217;s pandemic-induced global evacuation in 2020. She will serve as a teacher in Costa Rica through May 2025.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had always seen the Peace Corps as an opportunity to expand my perspective on the world and gain an intercultural experience that would stay with me for the rest of my life,&#8221; she says. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm excited to hear about students&#8217; dreams and aspirations and engage them in a meaningful classroom experience.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is grateful to UCSC for offering the Peace Corps Preparation Program which helped her gain tools and experience to be a competitive applicant. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She arrived in Costa Rica in early March and will teach vocational English to students in grades 8 through 12, serving as a co-teacher at a Colegio T&#233;cnico Profesional, a vocational high school that offers career paths for students to develop technical skills.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scarsciotti&#8217;s swearing-in ceremony&#8212;when she officially starts her two years of service&#8212;is May 26. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteers receive three months of 40-hour training weeks covering topics such as the Peace Corps&#8217; approach to development, valuing diversity, cultural norms and how to live with a host family, the host country&#8217;s history, classroom management skills, student-centered teaching approaches, classroom error and correction feedback, and the danger of a single story. The latter references Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TED talk, which explores how single stories can lead people to develop prejudiced ideas.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The language program alone includes 160 hours of training,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scarsciotti</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I learned so much and I&#8217;m very excited to grow more relationships with the local community members and feel more acclimated to the culture and language. In whatever small way I can, I aim to empower the community through improving opportunities for higher education, improving health and nutrition levels, and making a lasting impact through building inventive, self-sustaining solutions with community members.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Volunteering at UCSC</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empowering people is something </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scarsciotti</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did throughout her time at UCSC. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an undergrad student, she spent over 1,500 hours volunteering in various programs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The majority of these hours were spent with the Artistic Rehabilitative Therapeutic (ART) Initiative, a student-run organization that facilitates therapeutic art classes in Santa Cruz County correctional facilities. She volunteered with the ART Initiative for four years, teaching in the Blaine Street minimum-security jail, Rountree medium-security jail, and the Santa Cruz Main maximum-security jail.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ART Initiative was the cornerstone of the most meaningful work of my life,&#8221; she says. &#8220;After the first year of my involvement, I sought out additional opportunities to provide classes to people affected by incarceration. I began to volunteer with the William James Association (WJA), a similar organization that provides arts to adults and youth in correctional facilities as well as to returning residents.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the WJA, she taught a story-telling class and collage classes to adults experiencing mental health issues. She also co-facilitated a Transcommunal Peace Making class with UCSC Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Sociology John Brown Childs at the Soledad Prison. They discussed techniques for navigating barriers to peace between diverse communities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her senior year, she worked with fellow undergrad student Alyssa Tamboura, supporting her in creating the Walls to Bridges Book Project. This project was created in response to the pandemic&#8217;s impact on families affected by incarceration, as the pandemic closed all visitation opportunities in correctional facilities. They received letters from adults experiencing incarceration and gathered information about their children and what types of books they would appreciate. After receiving the initial letter, they called the child&#8217;s guardian and received permission to mail the child a book on behalf of the incarcerated family member, free of cost to the family.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was very important to us that system-impacted family members could maintain active and loving roles in their children&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scarsciotti</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also volunteered as an English as a Second Language tutor and as a Suicide Hotline Responder for two years.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Volunteering provided me with valuable life experience and the chance to respond to issues discussed in my university courses,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Learning about massive issues in society as a Sociology major could feel overwhelming at times.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing on the value of &#8216;small actions toward social change&#8217; helped her maintain hope for the future.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Engaging in work that aligns with my values gave my life a sense of purpose and allowed me to feel connected with the people around me,&#8221; Scarsciotti added. &#8220;Additionally, the training involved in my volunteering activities cultivated life skills that will forever stay with me. The Suicide Hotline Responder training especially enhanced my communication skills and equipped me with invaluable de-escalation skills.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>
<h3><strong>Praise for UCSC</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scarsciotti felt an immediate connection to UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was amazed by the beauty of the redwood forests. To have immediate access to the woods as well as the beach felt surreal.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the volunteer opportunities that UCSC facilitated, Scarsciotti</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appreciates the resources the university provided.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I utilized Learning Support Services (LSS) for scholarship essays,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I used LSS to review my Gilman International scholarship essay as well as my Gabriel Zimmerman Division of Social Sciences scholarship essay. I incorporated the very helpful feedback from the writing tutors, and I won both of those awards. I highly encourage undergrads to utilize this free resource.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She credits many professors for transforming her academic journey. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fran Guerra was the first professor to make a huge impact on me as an undergrad in Intro to Sociology. Every single lecture opened my eyes to societal issues and systemic disparity that I had never learned about in high school&#8217;s standardized education.&#8221;&#160; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Guerra passed away in 2017. It was after Guerra&#8217;s lecture about Mass Incarceration that Scarsciotti sought out the opportunity to start teaching art inside correctional facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And that experience changed my life and the way I navigated through the world. I also want to give a shout out to my life-changing Sociology professors&#8221; John Brown Childs, Rebecca London, Christie McCullen, Jenny Reardon, James Doucet-Battlemy, thought-provoking Linguistics professors Jorge Hankamer, Junko Ito, Ivy Sichel, Maziar Toosarvandani, Pranav Anand, and my supportive academic advisor, Tina Cossaboom.&#8221;</span></p>

However, since the care is provided at a cost less than the market rate for these services, the difference between the market rate and the benefit user&#8217;s cost is treated by the IRS as additional income (also known as imputed income for employees or miscellaneous income for students) and is taxable.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the introduction of the UCSC Back-up Care Program , and because the U.S. President had enacted a federal state of emergency due to the COVID Pandemic, the Stafford Act enabled the Back-up Care Program to be treated as non-taxable, as it qualified as disaster relief during this period.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the</span><strong> federal state of emergency ends on May 11, 2023, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the Stafford Act will be terminated; therefore, the employee or student who uses the Back-up Care Program will be required to pay taxes on the imputed or miscellaneous income corresponding to the hours of care used.&#160;</span></p>

<p>UC Santa Cruz scientists, along with a consortium of researchers, have released a draft of the first human pangenome&#8212;a new, usable reference for genomics that combines the genetic information of 47 individuals from different ancestral backgrounds to allow for a deeper, more accurate understanding of worldwide genomic diversity.&#160;</p>
<p>By adding 119 million bases&#8212;the &#8220;letters&#8221; in DNA sequences&#8212;to the existing genomics reference, the pangenome provides a representation of human genetic diversity that was not possible with a single reference genome. It is highly accurate, more complete and dramatically increases the detection of variants in the human genome, as shown in a collection of groundbreaking papers published today in the journals <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>The pangenome was produced by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC), which is co-led by UCSC&#8217;s Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Benedict Paten and Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Karen Miga and is now available for use in an assembly hub on the <a href="http://hprc-browser.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genome Browser</a>. More than a dozen UCSC researchers and students are contributors to this project, which will continue into 2024 when the researchers plan to release a final pangenome with genomic information from 350 individuals.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are introducing more diversity and equity into the reference by sampling diverse human beings and including them in this structure that everyone can use,&#8221; said Paten, who is the senior author on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05896-x">the main marker paper</a>. &#8220;One genome isn&#8217;t enough to represent everybody&#8212;the pangenome will ultimately be something that is inclusive and representative.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Understanding genomic variation</h2>
<figure class="lead-image right article-image" style="max-width: 350px;"><img alt="benedictpaten_headshot350.jpg" class="" height="430" src="images/benedictpaten_headshot350.jpg" width="350"/>

</figure>
<p>Each person&#8217;s genome varies slightly&#8212;by about 0.4 percent compared to the next person, on average&#8212;and understanding these differences can provide insight into their health, help to diagnose disease, predict medical outcomes, and guide treatments. Using the pangenome reference will improve scientists&#8217; ability to detect and understand variation in future studies.&#160;</p>
<p>Typically when scientists and clinicians study an individual&#8217;s genome to look for variation, they compare that individuals&#8217; DNA to that of a standard reference to determine where there are differences of one or more base pairs. Until now, the reference genome has primarily been represented by a single sequence for each human chromosome, mostly sourced from one individual. But, this reference is nearly 20 years old and fundamentally limited in that it can not represent the wealth of genetic variations present in the human population. This introduces an issue called reference bias into genome analysis.</p>
<p>In contrast, the new pangenome is a reference that combines the genomes of 47 individuals from various ancestral backgrounds. The pangenome looks like a linear reference in areas where the sequences have the same bases, and expands to show the areas where there are differences. It represents many different versions of the human genome sequence at the same time, and gives scientists a more accurate point of comparison for variation that is present in some populations but not others.</p>
<p>&#8220;One genome can't possibly represent all of the rich variation we know can be observed and studied around the world,&#8221; said Miga, Director of the HPRC Production Center at UCSC. &#8220;The number one goal of the human pangenome reference is to try to broaden the representation of a reference resource to be more inclusive and more equitable for studying the human species, as a collection of references and not just one.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Genomic variation can be small, consisting of differences of just one or a few DNA bases, or it can be large structural variants, classified as variants that are 50 base pairs or larger. These larger, structural variants can have important health implications. Until now, researchers have been unable to identify more than 70 percent of the structural variants that exist in human genomes due to limited technologies and the bias of using a single reference sequence.</p>
<p>Of the 119 million new bases added to the reference with the pangenome, roughly 90 million of these derive from structural variation. Structural variants are complex and may be inversions of sequences, insertions, deletions, or tandem repeats&#8212;a segment of two or more bases repeated numerous times. These new bases will help researchers to study regions in the genome for which there was previously no reference, and potentially be able to associate structural variants with disease in future studies.</p>

</figure>
<p>&#8220;Now, we can map to more structural variants, so we're finding features and areas in the genome that just weren't there before,&#8221; Miga said. &#8220;That&#8217;s exciting because it's allowing us to look at gene regulation in a unique way that we couldn't study before, because those areas probably would have been inappropriately mapped or just ignored altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using the pangenome reference for genomic analysis increases the detection of structural variants by 104 percent as compared to detection using the standard reference. The pangenome reference also increases the accuracy of calling small variants, those just a few bases long, by about 34 percent because of the increased amount of data present in the pangenome.</p>
<p>Each human carries a paired set of chromosomes&#8212;one set inherited from the mother and one from the father. The individual genomes present in the pangenome reference contains haplotype-resolved information, meaning it can confidently distinguish the two parental sets of chromosomes&#8212;a major scientific feat. Having this information will help scientists better understand how various genes and diseases are inherited.&#160;</p>
<p>This also means the current reference actually includes 94 distinct genome sequences, with the goal of getting to 700 by 2024.&#160;</p>
<h2>Creating the pangenome</h2>
<p>The pangenome was made possible through the development of advanced computational techniques to align the multiple genome sequences into one, usable reference in a structure called a pangenome graph. Paten and researchers in the UCSC Computational Genomics lab helped lead the HPRC efforts to develop the algorithmic methods needed to create this pangenome graph structure.</p>
<p>Because of the methods used in this project, all of the genomes within the pangenome reference are of extremely high quality and accuracy, covering more than 99 percent of each human genome with more than 99 percent accuracy.</p>

<figcaption>The new draft pangenome reference contains 47 genomes instead of just one, and will provide a much better point of comparison than the traditional reference to find and understand the differences in our DNA.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&#8220;In the linear reference, we had only one sequence, one representation of each gene,&#8221; said Mobin Asri, a bioinformatics Ph.D. candidate at UCSC and co-first author on the main paper. &#8220;But we know that our genes have different variations in the human population. Using the pangenome graph, we want to have all of those variations in a single structure&#8212;and a graph is a natural way to do this.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The HPRC project relies heavily on long- and ultra long-read sequencing technology to read DNA from biological samples. With recent advances, these techniques can now decode thousands to millions of base pairs of the genome at once. The long stretches of DNA reads are then assembled via specialized algorithms into more complete genomic sequences. Ideally each assembled sequence should represent the sequence of one chromosome.</p>
<p>Long reads contain errors about one percent of the time and current assembly algorithms are&#160;<br/>not perfect, which can cause the assembled sequences to be erroneous in some locations. To check for and correct these errors, the individual genomes that have been sequenced and assembled move through multiple tools, including a reliability pipeline developed by Asri. Once having been processed by these tools, the researchers can ensure the assemblies are accurate and complete.</p>
<p>After moving through Asri&#8217;s pipeline, the various genomes are compiled via complex algorithmic methods into the pangenome graph structure. Visually, the graph genome allows researchers to view differences in the various reference sequences as diverging areas in otherwise shared paths.</p>
<h2>Building an accessible resource</h2>
<p>All of the first 47 diploid genomes in the draft pangenome were sourced from individuals who participated in the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G), an influential effort which created a catalog of common human genetic variation from openly consented samples and was completed in 2015. The open consent status of these samples allow any researcher to access the resource without the privacy barriers that typically accompany genome research, with the aim of making the pangenome accessible to as many people as possible.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Becoming a common resource is something that&#8217;s fundamental to the success of a human pangenome reference,&#8221; Miga said. &#8220;It has to have the ability to be accessible and open around the world to all researchers so we can use it as the foundation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The HPRC team is focused on outreach to ensure that the pangenome is a useful resource that will be utilized in clinics around the world. This means facilitating annotations, feedback, and input from the researchers carrying out studies using the pangenome reference.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The draft pangenome is an important proof of principle that we hope is going to influence a lot of people and get them thinking about the pangenome and how it might affect their work,&#8221; Paten said. &#8220;Looking ahead, we see a lot of engagement with other groups&#8212;it takes a lot of different people to build something that is going to become a big community resource.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with a focus on accessibility, the HPRC project has a dedicated ethics team focused on the social and legal implications of this project. They are working to anticipate challenging issues and help guide informed consent, prioritize the study of different samples, explore possible regulatory issues pertaining to clinical adoption, and work with international and Indigenous communities to incorporate their genome sequences in these broader efforts.</p>

<h2>Continuing the legacy and future work</h2>
<p>The human pangenome is a continuation of decades-long efforts from scientists at UC Santa Cruz to understand the biological code that underlies human life.&#160;</p>
<p>In 2000, Jim Kent, then a UCSC graduate student and now a research scientist at the Genomics Institute and director of the UCSC Genome Browser, wrote the code that assembled the first working draft of the human genome. UCSC scientists published it with open access to anyone who wanted to use it. Since then, UCSC has been at the forefront of genomics research.</p>
<p>In April 2022, UCSC&#8217;s Karen Miga co-led the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium to <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html">assemble the first complete sequencing of a human genome</a>, filling in missing, complex regions of reference that had long eluded scientists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 2000, we&#8217;ve had a series of increasingly more accurate representations of one genome,&#8221; said David Haussler, Scientific Director of the UCSC Genomics Institute who led the UCSC team on the original Human Genome Project and advises on the pangenome project. &#8220;But no matter how accurately you represent one genome, that&#8217;s not going to represent all of humanity. Now is a turning point: no longer genomics of the one standard human genome, but genomics for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The researchers are making progress toward the goal of completing the full pangenome by 2024. The team is in the process of recruiting new individuals to represent some populations not included in the 1000 Genomes Project, particularly people of Middle Eastern and African ancestry. Miga, as the director of the Data Production Center at UCSC, will spearhead these efforts going forward.</p>
<p>In addition to completing the final pangenome reference, the researchers are working toward forming an international human pangenome project that would establish partnerships with researchers across the world. These partnerships would include a two-way skills and knowledge exchange, aimed to bring the skills and technology needed to create high-quality reference genomes into the hands of researchers worldwide so they can carry out their own research.</p>
<p>Other UCSC researchers on the main paper include Marina Haukness, Glenn Hickey, Julian Lucas, Jean Monlong, Xian Chang, Jordan Eizenga, Charles Markello, Adam Novak, Hugh Olsen, and Trevor Pesout.</p>

We aspire to extraordinary outcomes in our teaching, research, scholarship and creative activities, and we strive to get there by embedding principles of diversity, equity and inclusion in all that we do.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of this vital work is accomplished through staff organizations that have been founded by staff and sponsored by the university for the purpose of providing opportunities to build and strengthen both personal and professional connections that enrich our campus community. The work that our staff does through these organizations is, in fact, work on behalf of the university and should be valued and respected as much as any other work done by an employee. This is not &#8220;volunteer&#8221; work that an employee does in their free time, and we need to be sure that staff have time during their regular workday to do this part of their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, I write to reaffirm our continuing commitment by encouraging and supporting our staff who work for these organizations. I believe deeply that an effective UC Santa Cruz manager or supervisor is one who supports opportunities for staff to contribute to the campus.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you in advance for your continued support of the amazing staff on our campus.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cynthia Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fda20d4c807270462f0aea1ac3232408"><name>alumni-reunion-73</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Golden Slugs use lessons learned to change the world</title><summary>Among the magical moments of Alumni Reunion Weekend 2023 were the conversations among classmates who recounted stories of their days on the UC Santa Cruz campus. </summary><start-date>1683640800000</start-date><display-name>alumni-reunion-73</display-name><path>/2023/05/alumni-reunion-73</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/alumni-reunion-73</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1683587468601</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1685031354316</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Paula Hermann</name><title></title><phone/><email>paula@phcreativestrategies.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/classof731.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/classof731.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>classof731.jpg</name><display-name>classof731.jpg</display-name><file-size>102678</file-size><width>450</width><height>290</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/classof731thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/classof731thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>classof731thumb.jpg</name><display-name>classof731thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15031</file-size><width>80</width><height>52</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>UCSC students protest the Vietnam War in the 70s.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/classof733.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/classof733.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>classof733.jpg</name><display-name>classof733.jpg</display-name><file-size>91802</file-size><width>450</width><height>298</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>UCSC student speaks with Page Smith, the founding provost of Cowell College.</image-caption></secondary-images><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/classof732.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/classof732.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>classof732.jpg</name><display-name>classof732.jpg</display-name><file-size>51085</file-size><width>350</width><height>231</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>UCSC students advocate for peace in light of the Vietnam War.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alumni reminisce about how their experiences at UC Santa Cruz, in and out of the classroom, had an enduring influence on their lives and others'
</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the magical moments of Alumni Reunion Weekend 2023 were the conversations among classmates who recounted stories of their days on the UC Santa Cruz campus. A virtual Golden Slug Alumni event, moderated by Sam Magill (Crown College &#8217;71), included graduates from the early 1970s who reminisced, reconnected, and shared how they used their Slug experience to make a difference in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite decades of life lived since their college days, these legendary Slugs pulled memories that included precise details&#8212;names of professors, friends, courses, books, and world events&#8212;that changed their lives.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a shared appreciation for hallmarks of the UCSC experience that have transcended generations, including the professors who were not only thought partners but who also joined them for lunch or hosted them for dinner; the majestic beauty of the redwoods; the freedom of expression and openness to learning that, even today, surprise and delight current students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These alums were in college, and of draft age, during the Vietnam War. Their time at UC Santa Cruz was not only shaped by their academic experiences but also by the out-of-the-classroom activities centered on the political unrest in the world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lively discussion around memories of sit-ins and protests, including a protest of then-California Governor Ronald Reagan&#8217;s visit to campus. Some shared their first experience with activism, and others shared stories of their first (and only) arrest!&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;87,&#8221; &#8220;116,&#8221; &#8220;6,&#8221; &#8220;257,&#8221; the men on the call shouted out; their draft number forever etched in their memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The day after the lottery, you could tell what their number was just by looking at them,&#8221; said Jack Liebster (Cowell &#8217;73).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the men shared their accounts of applying to be conscientious objectors, the women shared their experiences&#8212;participating in marches, writing protest letters to the draft board, or shutting down campus central services with a sit-in when the Board of Regents was on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I remember going to my first march,&#8221; said Ziggy Rendler-Bregman (Porter &#8217;75). &#8220;It was a coming-of-age experience, an awakening. I remember when my dad, who served in WWII, picked me up. I told him about the march on the car ride home, and he came unglued!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those experiences formed political views, influenced career choices, shaped lives, and motivated action to make the world a better place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rendler-Bregman used her UCSC-acquired political action and conflict management skills to help restore arts education in Santa Cruz schools and to launch the local land trust.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valerie Fett-Harry (Kresge &#8217;76) used her activism skills to advocate for women in various ways, including establishing quality onsite childcare centers within the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The activities we participated in at UC Santa Cruz changed us, and we carried them throughout our lives,&#8221; Fett-Harry said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alan Deyoung (Stevenson &#8217;69) earned three Fulbright awards for his work in three different former Soviet republics in Central Asia from 1995 to 2017. Joseph Palacios (Merrill &#8217;73), who taught sociology and Latin American studies at Georgetown, served on President Obama&#8217;s Board of Visitors of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by their UCSC professors, many chose to pursue careers in education. Franklin CampbellJones (Merrill &#8217;73) spent his career in higher education in work centered on equity and inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have been around the world,&#8221; says CampbellJones. &#8220;Santa Cruz never left me. The creative interdisciplinary approach to the world, learning to be a partner in thinking, and bridging ideas, people, and cultures&#8212;these were gifts I got from UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his career as an astrophysicist, Terry Teays, Ph.D., (Merrill &#8217;73) said his approach to teaching was influenced by his UCSC professors, who &#8220;gave you the opportunity to sink your teeth into real things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lifetime has passed for these legends, yet their pride for their alma mater is omnipresent. Sporting their UCSC merchandise during the call, many shared stories of how their Slug shirts and hats have stimulated conversations with people around the world. Fett-Harry, who worked in Micronesia with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) supporting disaster relief, said she met six people on the island with ties to UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While their years at UCSC account for just a sliver of their lifetime, it is evident that their experiences had an enduring influence on their lives and their ability to make a difference in the world.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="00c7cf8b80727046427734a9caf91920"><name>campus-bikeshare</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC part of regional partnership bringing bike share to Santa Cruz County </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz community members will soon have access to a new bike share system that stretches across the county.

Starting this June, e-Bikes will be available to rent through the </span><a href="https://santacruz.bcycle.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional Electric Bike Share Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The program is a partnership between UCSC, the County of Santa Cruz, Cabrillo College, and the cities of Santa Cruz, Capitola and Watsonville.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC is happy to be partnering with our neighbors on this exciting initiative,&#8221; Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) Executive Director Dan Henderson said. &#8220;Bike share can be greatly beneficial to not only our university affiliates, but to all persons in the region when they choose their commute mode. We hope that our students, employees, and guests consider this low-cost and convenient alternative to single occupancy vehicles when traveling to and from our campus, and around the region.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The City and our regional partners are excited to bring an improved bike share system to Santa Cruz at no-cost to our jurisdictions with expanded service area and important docking system,&#8221; said City of Santa Cruz Transportation Planner Claire Gallogly. &#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bike share system reflects the commitment of the participants to reduce single-occupant vehicle trips, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve multimodal mobility, and increase the number of trips made by sustainable transportation modes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, approximately 400 BCycle e-Bikes and 800 docks will be available throughout the City of Santa Cruz and UCSC. There will be more than 25 docking locations across the residential campus, Westside Research Park, and the Coastal Science Campus. In 2024, bike share is expected to expand to Capitola, Cabrillo College, and Watsonville. BCycle and its parent company, Trek, are financing all capital costs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you live outside of biking distance from campus, and you work or attend classes at UCSC you can use bike share to move around campus or between campuses,&#8221; explained Jonathan Weidman, TAPS Associate Director. &#8220;You can also commute with it from the city of Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the BCycle app, riders can access and unlock bikes. The app and BCycle website will show bike locations and battery charge levels.The e-bikes must be picked up and dropped off at any of the dedicated BCycle docks.</span></p>

The Orientation Course was awarded the 2023 Regional II Innovative Program Award from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Association for Orientation, Transition and Retention in Higher Education, known as NODA. The award recognizes a program or unique approach to a challenging situation or a specific campus need.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is one of the first universities in the country to require all incoming first-year and transfer students to take a unit-bearing orientation course approved by the Academic Senate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz is leading the University of California and the nation in ensuring access, consistency, and success through innovation in its orientation program,&#8221; said Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement Richard Hughey. &#8220;The online Slug Orientation is a transformative course experience for our students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaborators included the Council of Provosts, Campus Orientation, Faculty Instructional Technology Center, Online Education, Office of Campus Advising Coordination, Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students, Undergraduate Admissions, Financial Aid and Scholarships, The Division of Student Affairs and Success, Office of the Registrar, Summer Session, Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services, Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion, Student Health Center, Business and Administrative Services, academic programs and departments across campus, academic and institutional support units across campus, and the Academic Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The required one-unit Orientation Course accessed through Canvas has ten instructor-led courses for first-year students and four instructor-led courses for transfer students. Each college adapts the course to their theme and puts together five assignments. These courses and the general orientation content make up the summer program. During three asynchronous modules students learn how to navigate the campus and its processes. Part I provides information on the structure of the university, reminders of critical admissions deadlines, and helps students explore their academic goals, Part 2 focuses on advising and fall class enrollment preparation, and Part 3 provides campus, academic and social resources, move-in preparation and Fall Welcome Week information. Students must complete Parts 1 and 2 to receive a date to enroll in fall quarter classes. All of the orientation content is available to students throughout their first year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit-bearing orientation builds on the 2019 replacement of a series of 1-day summer orientation events to a continuing summer connection with students as they plan their academic journey. Close collaboration among the college provosts and orientation, Director of Orientation Rosa Plaza, Assistant Director of Online Education Aaron Zachmeier,&#160; and past Kresge Provost Ben Leeds Carson, in particular, made possible this integrated program that helps all new students begin their UC Santa Cruz academic journey a little sooner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have created something that&#8217;s very informative and functional which gives new students the opportunity to learn the information at their own pace,&#8221; Plaza said. &#8220;Throughout the summer, we are available to newly admitted students to provide guidance in completing the course and learning about the campus resources and expectations, and to help them make connections.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program provides a personal touch through orientation leaders who are current students. From June to late September, 30 to 40 leaders, along with peer navigators in the residential colleges, are available to students and their family members through daily drop-in hours via chat, email, phone and Zoom. During the one-on-one meetings, they answer questions, help students understand deadlines, meet admissions requirements, and guide them through the class enrollment process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incoming students also meet with academic advisors and have opportunities to meet with faculty and engage in virtual social gatherings called Slug Games, where they meet other new students and build connections and community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a follow-up survey, students said the online course was more engaging and helped them develop a sense of belonging in their college and to UCSC. They also said having all the content and information in one location and more time to move through the modules made it easier to navigate and less intimidating.&#160;</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In summer 2023, students will also have options of a new on-campus orientation </span><a href="https://orientation.ucsc.edu/summer/on-campus-optional/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Connection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, as well as the 5-week, 7-unit </span><a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/summer-edge/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Edge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programs with on-campus residential and online alternatives. </span></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="01c4cd4880727046427734a94c2a80b6"><name>psygene-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz to lead data collection center for major federal project on genetic underpinnings of neurological conditions</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute will run the Data Coordination Center for the Scalable and Systematic Neurobiology of Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Disorder Risk Genes (SSPsyGene) Consortium.</summary><start-date>1683615600000</start-date><path>/2023/05/psygene-announcement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/psygene-announcement</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1683656854838</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1683659323709</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/david_headshot.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/david_headshot.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david_headshot.jpg</name><display-name>david_headshot.jpg</display-name><file-size>24378</file-size><width>400</width><height>325</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/david_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/david_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>david_80.jpg</name><display-name>david_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>5672</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>David Haussler,&#160;Scientific Director at the UCSC Genomics Institute, is a principal investigator on the new&#160;Data Coordination Center.

The data generation centers for the consortium will be: UC Los Angeles; Yale; Rutgers, Northshore University, University of Chicago, and Baylor College; and the Broad Institute and MIT. UCSC will also lead several outreach efforts connected to this project.<br/><br/>&#8220;Working with the data generation centers and the NIH, we want to standardize the phenotyping of neuropsychiatric conditions using a variety of models ranging from human stem cell models such as brain organoids and neurons, all the way to model organisms like zebrafish," said Mohammed Mostajo Radji, a research scientist at the Genomics Institute and a co-investigator on the project. &#8220;We need to prioritize the most important genes underlying neurological conditions. We are particularly interested in genes that are involved in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, and in which small mutations translate to major phenotypes&#8221;.&#160;<br/><br/>This grant will provide nearly $7.5 million in funding over the next five years. The principal investigators (PIs) of the Data Coordination Center will be David Haussler, Scientific Director at the UCSC Genomics Institute, and Tom Nowakowski, an associate professor at UC San Francisco, with Mostajo-Radji playing a key leadership role as well. Co-investigators will be Associate Professor of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology Olena Vaske, Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Benedict Paten, and Genomics Institute Associate Research Scientist Max Haeussler. The program manager will be Catharina Lindley.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Neurological disease attacks our spirit like no other disease, and so many families have had to cope with lifetime illness from it,&#8221; Haussler said. &#8220;This nationwide project is a frontal assault on the biological mechanisms behind neurological disease, building on more than two decades of genomic advances that UCSC is proud to have played a role in. We are very honored to have been chosen to be the coordination center for it.&#8221;<br/><br/>One of the first major tasks for the team at UC Santa Cruz will be to coordinate an initial selection of the 250 most relevant genes for the consortium to study out of the nearly 30,000 protien coding genes in the human genome. This selection will take place over the first three to six months of the project and involve a science-informed ranking and classification process, drawing on previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of neurological conditions.&#160;<br/><br/>They will also consider that some important genes may not be represented in past GWAS studies due to lack of sampling across diverse populations, which can cause researchers to miss genes that are less common among people of European ancestry.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>After the initial genes are selected, the data generation centers will lead research on these genes over the next five years. This will help the researchers understand which genes and their specific mutations overlap in many disorders and therefore are important to study.&#160;<br/><br/>Multiple types of data will be produced that UCSC researchers will be tasked with coordinating into a cohesive story. These data will include genomic and physiological data of human brain organoids, as well as high-speed imaging of human neuronal activity, and behavior of zebrafish.The Genomics Institute&#8217;s data coordination efforts will emphasize standardization and accessibility across these data.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This is the next frontier,&#8221; Mostajo-Radji said. &#8220;It took the wider genomics community several years of massive effort to standardize genomics, but at this point genomics is such a productive field because so much of the data is standard &#8212; anyone from anywhere in the world can see and understand the data because we all speak the same language. We have not gotten to this point yet with neuroscience phenotyping, but it&#8217;s time.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>The data will be available to the consortium members in a form quite similar to that presented by the <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, which is one of the most widely used genomics data repositories by scientists worldwide. It will be hosted in a <a href="https://medium.com/@benedictpaten/a-data-biosphere-for-biomedical-research-d212bbfae95d">data biosphere environment</a>, a concept for modular and interoperable genomics data storage pioneered by Paten. They will also follow the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>, standards to ensure data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We at the Genomics Institute have a history of structuring and making genomic data available to scientists and the public, from the human genome itself to the Cancer Genome Atlas and other major projects,&#8221; Haeussler said. &#8220;The SSPsyGene project continues this tradition, and we will ensure data is easily and quickly accessible to everyone in the consortium at first, and ultimately to the public.&#8221;<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the project, the UCSC and UCSF researchers will strive to create a collaborative environment among the consortium members, and communicate with the larger neuroscience and genomics communities. They will also coordinate a series of capstone projects that will serve to test the data interoperability and fine-tune common data standards.<br/><br/>Outreach efforts connected to this project will include developing a class at UC Santa Cruz on neuroscience global health diplomacy that focuses on how communities of scientists are built around addressing neurological disorders.&#160;<br/><br/>The class, as with the overall consortium, will focus on how scientists can effectively ask a targeted research question across a population as diverse as the entire United States.</p>

<p><span>The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC)&#8212;co-led by UCSC&#8217;s Associate Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Benedict Paten and Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering Karen Miga&#8212;today released a draft of the </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/pangenome-draft.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1683817400414000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3uOT8b6rLkzrJjiXKE6XhM" href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/pangenome-draft.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>first human pangenome</span></a></span><span>, which combines the genetic material of 47 individuals from different ancestral backgrounds. More than a dozen researchers from our Genomics Institute including several student researchers have been involved with this project, which will continue into 2024, when researchers expect to release a final version of the pangenome with genomic information from 350 individuals.</span></p>
<p><span>The pangenome is significant in that it gives scientists a deeper, more accurate, and more inclusive understanding of worldwide genomic diversity, allowing for more detailed genomic analyses. Even in its draft form of 47 sequences, the pangenome has already proven to be more effective at detecting variants. Having this information helps scientists better understand how various genes and diseases are inherited, for example, and provides valuable insights into human health.</span></p>
<p><span>The pangenome is the latest achievement in a sustained effort by UC Santa Cruz researchers to decipher the chemical makeup of the human genetic code.</span></p>
<p><span>UC Santa Cruz made history in 2000, when then-graduate student Jim Kent, now a research scientist at the Genomics Institute, wrote the code that allowed the publicly funded Human Genome Project to assemble and publish the first human genome sequence. The mapping is considered one of the greatest scientific feats in history. Last spring, the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium, co-led by Prof. Miga, announced it had </span><span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup/in-the-news&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1683817400414000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1NP45fIIVCdibqz2k306jA" href="https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/t2tworkinggroup/in-the-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>assembled the first complete sequencing of a human genome</span></a></span><span>, filling in missing, complex regions that had long eluded scientists because of the limitations of DNA-sequencing technologies.</span></p>
<p><span>The pangenome is another huge scientific step forward. Please join us in recognizing this remarkable achievement. Congratulations to all in our campus community who played a role.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin> Cynthia Larive, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor and Lori Kletzer  Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0769fe1b8072704672c35b86edc97bd0"><name>dickson-emeriti</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Dickson Emeriti Professorships awarded to faculty in music, theater arts, and biology</title><summary>Three UCSC faculty members—Kathy Foley, Edward Houghton, and Susan Strome—have been honored with Edward A.

Dickson Emeritus Professorship Awards for the 2023&#8211;24 academic year.</p>
<p><strong>Kathy Foley</strong>, distinguished professor emerita of theater arts,<strong> Edward Houghton</strong>, professor emeritus of music and former dean of the Arts Division, and <strong>Susan Strome</strong>, distinguished professor emerita of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, were awarded the Dickson Emeriti Professorships to acknowledge and support their ongoing activities in public service, research, creative works, and teaching.</p>
<p>The awards are given annually and funded by an endowment from the estate of former UC Regent Edward A. Dickson. The professorships make it possible for the university to retain the invaluable services of highly accomplished, retired faculty members for the benefit of its students.</p>
<p>Foley will use the Dickson award to initiate a new research project to study the history and influence of an important San Francisco arts program, founded in 1963 as the American Society for Eastern Arts (ASEA) and later known as the Center for World Music (CWM). The influential program allowed many Americans to study Asian and other performance genres with master artists, primarily of Indonesian and Indian traditions of music, dance, and theater, but also of Japanese, Korean, and African traditions.</p>
<p>ASEA and CWM led to significant globalization of artistic resources tapped by contemporary American artists, dancers, and musicians in creative work and university teaching. Foley&#8217;s research will include studying their archives, which are currently split between San Diego, where CWM moved its headquarters in 1979, and the University of Illinois. She will spend time in San Francisco interviewing and visiting studios of the many alumni of the Center for World Music who still live there, and she will study the center&#8217;s links to Indian and Indonesian dance and music programs at Wesleyan University and other institutions.</p>
<p>Houghton has spent decades transcribing into modern musical notation the 40 works from the Chigi Codex, a rare illuminated manuscript containing musical masterworks from the late 15th century. The Dickson award will provide support for publication of the transcriptions along with critical commentary on each work, concordant sources, and a historical study of the manuscript and its art. This work will be published by the University of Chicago Press in its Monuments of Renaissance Music series.</p>
<p>The award will also provide support for a concert of works from the Chigi Codex at the international Herrenchiemsee Festival in Bavaria, Germany, on July 19, 2023, and for Houghton to give a presentation on the Chigi Codex at the international Medieval and Renaissance Music Conference in Munich, Germany, July 24-28, 2023.</p>
<p>Strome is active in efforts to support and empower women leaders in STEM and will use the Dickson award to provide partial funding for two CoRE workshops. CoRE (Community of Replenishment &amp; Empowerment) is a group of women supporting women, whose mission is to support, revitalize, empower, and promote networking of women in academia through structured multi-day workshops. Strome is organizing two CoRE workshops, each involving 10 women in positions of leadership in STEM and two facilitators.</p>
<p>CoRE (previously called Nag&#8217;s Heart) has offered over 100 workshops to over 500 participants using a well-honed format involving intensive work sessions during which each participant discusses a dilemma of personal importance and strategizes with the rest of the group on approaches and solutions. The workshops also include unstructured time to relax, enjoy each other&#8217;s company, share communal meals, and continue discussions, as well as a closing ceremony for participants to share final thoughts and feelings. Strome&#8217;s workshops aim to support and empower the participants and to improve the recruitment, retention, and success of many more women faculty in the participants&#8217; circles of influence.</p>
<p>A call for the Dickson Emeriti Professorship Award is sent out to all eligible emeriti faculty early in the Fall quarter. The deadline for submission of applications is early in the winter quarter and one to three awardees are announced each spring, usually at the Emeriti Association Luncheon with the Chancellor.

The images of persistent, intense radio emissions from an ultracool dwarf reveal the presence of a cloud of high-energy electrons trapped in the object&#8217;s powerful magnetic field, forming a double-lobed structure analogous to radio images of Jupiter&#8217;s radiation belts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are actually imaging the magnetosphere of our target by observing the radio-emitting plasma&#8212;its radiation belt&#8212;in the magnetosphere. That has never been done before for something the size of a gas giant planet outside of our solar system,&#8221; said Melodie Kao, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper on the new findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06138-w">published May 15 in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>Strong magnetic fields form a &#8220;magnetic bubble&#8221; around a planet called a magnetosphere, which can trap and accelerate particles to near the speed of light. All the planets in our solar system that have such magnetic fields, including Earth, as well as Jupiter and the other giant planets, have radiation belts consisting of these high-energy charged particles trapped by the planet&#8217;s magnetic field.</p>
<p>Earth&#8217;s radiation belts, known as the Van Allen belts, are large donut-shaped zones of high-energy particles captured from solar winds by the magnetic field. Most of the particles in Jupiter&#8217;s belts are from volcanoes on its moon Io. If you could put them side by side, the radiation belt that Kao and her team have imaged would be 10 million times brighter than Jupiter&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Particles deflected by the magnetic field toward the poles generate auroras (&#8220;northern lights&#8221;) when they interact with the atmosphere, and Kao&#8217;s team also obtained the first image capable of differentiating between the location of an object&#8217;s aurora and its radiation belts outside our solar system.</p>
<p>The ultracool dwarf imaged in this study straddles the boundary between low-mass stars and massive brown dwarfs. &#8220;While the formation of stars and planets can be different, the physics inside of them can be very similar in that mushy part of the mass continuum connecting low-mass stars to brown dwarfs and gas giant planets,&#8221; Kao explained.</p>
<p>Characterizing the strength and shape of the magnetic fields of this class of objects is largely uncharted terrain, she said. Using their theoretical understanding of these systems and numerical models, planetary scientists can predict the strength and shape of a planet&#8217;s magnetic field, but they haven&#8217;t had a good way to easily test those predictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Auroras can be used to measure the strength of the magnetic field, but not the shape. We designed this experiment to showcase a method for assessing the shapes of magnetic fields on brown dwarfs and eventually exoplanets,&#8221; Kao said.</p>
<p>The strength and shape of the magnetic field can be an important factor in determining a planet&#8217;s habitability. &#8220;When we&#8217;re thinking about the habitability of exoplanets, the role of their magnetic fields in maintaining a stable environment is something to consider in addition to things like the atmosphere and climate,&#8221; Kao said.</p>
<p>To generate a magnetic field, a planet&#8217;s interior must be hot enough to have electrically conducting fluids, which in the case of Earth is the molten iron in its core. In Jupiter, the conducting fluid is hydrogen under so much pressure it becomes metallic. Metallic hydrogen probably also generates magnetic fields in brown dwarfs, Kao said, while in the interiors of stars the conducting fluid is ionized hydrogen.</p>
<p>The ultracool dwarf known as LSR J1835+3259 was the only object Kao felt confident would yield the high-quality data needed to resolve its radiation belts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;ve established that this particular kind of steady-state, low-level radio emission traces radiation belts in the large-scale magnetic fields of these objects, when we see that kind of emission from brown dwarfs&#8212;and eventually from gas giant exoplanets&#8212;we can more confidently say they probably have a big magnetic field, even if our telescope isn&#8217;t big enough to see the shape of it,&#8221; Kao said, adding that she is looking forward to when the Next Generation Very Large Array, currently being planned by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), can image many more extrasolar radiation belts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a critical first step in finding many more such objects and honing our skills to search for smaller and smaller magnetospheres, eventually enabling us to study those of potentially habitable, Earth-size planets,&#8221; said coauthor Evgenya Shkolnik at Arizona State University, who has been studying the magnetic fields and habitability of planets for many years.</p>
<p>The team used the High Sensitivity Array, consisting of 39 radio dishes coordinated by the NRAO in the United States and the Effelsberg radio telescope operated by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;By combining radio dishes from across the world, we can make incredibly high-resolution images to see things no one has ever seen before. Our image is comparable to reading the top row of an eye chart in California while standing in Washington, D.C.,&#8221; said coauthor Jackie Villadsen at Bucknell University.</p>
<p>Kao emphasized that this discovery was a true team effort, relying heavily on the observational expertise of co-first author Amy Mioduszewski at NRAO in planning the study and analyzing the data, as well as the multiwavelength stellar flare expertise of Villadsen and Shkolnik. This work was supported by NASA and the Heising-Simons Foundation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0cea24418072704678f2b331353345d1"><name>thi-bookshop-partnership-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>  Partnership between The Humanities Institute and Bookshop Santa Cruz has made Santa Cruz a premiere literary destination</title><summary>Back in 2015, The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz (THI), and Bookshop Santa Cruz joined forces to promote, support and organize events featuring fiction and creative nonfiction authors, historians, poets, dignitaries, Civil Rights pioneers, philosophers and investigative journalists.

The influential political leader, lawyer, author and activist </span><a href="https://www.bookshopsantacruz.com/stacey-abrams-2023"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stacey Abrams is coming to the Rio Theater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;on June 4 to promote her thriller, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogue Justice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.bookshopsantacruz.com/ocean-vuong"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean Vuong will read his poetry on June 8 at the Cowell Ranch Hay Barn on the UCSC campus.&#160;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both readings sold out almost immediately.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Santa Cruz&#8217;s current status as a book-lover&#8217;s hotspot didn&#8217;t just happen by itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2015, two vital local institutions&#8212;</span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute at UC Santa Cruz (THI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Bookshop Santa Cruz&#8212;joined forces to promote, support and organize events featuring novelists, creative nonfiction authors, historians, poets, dignitaries, Civil Rights pioneers, philosophers and investigative journalists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housed within the Humanities division at UCSC, THI is a hub for new directions in Humanities research and teaching, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and public engagement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The three pillars of THI&#8217;s work &#8211; research excellence, student success, and public programs &#8211; are closely connected and mutually reinforcing," said UCSC alumna Irena </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poli&#263;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing director of the Humanities Institute at UCSC. &#8220;And teaming up with Bookshop helped us launch initiatives that are open not just to UCSC students, faculty, and staff, but the community at large.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THI and Bookshop brought unique strengths to the partnership. Bookshop could order and distribute books for sale at their co-sponsored events, and its seasoned events staff understood the dynamics of popular readings, from the best way to organize signing lines to handling Q &amp; A sessions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, THI organizes campus and community dialogues about the readings and reserve big on-campus venues for the most popular events, including the Quarry Amphitheater.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These days, we are definitely considered one of the premier literary destinations on the West Coast,&#8221; Poli&#263;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;But this is so much more than just literature and creating a literary hub. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is about the campus and community working closely together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year the calendar is so crammed with literary events that it&#8217;s almost impossible to catch them all. Readers who love edgy, overlooked voices as well as more mainstream authors no longer have to hit the road and head up to San Francisco to see all their favorite literary stars, as well as a long list of eminent people who just so happen to be out on the road promoting new books.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Book lovers can attend the </span><a href="https://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/news-events/living-writers-series/spring-2023-living-writers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living Writers Series,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presented by the UCSC Literature Department and the Creative Writing Program, co-sponsored by THI and Bookshop Santa Cruz, and featuring an array of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">award-winning contemporary writers and cross-genre artists in readings that celebrate diversity and inclusion.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they can enjoy the annual </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/morton-marcus-poetry-reading/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morton Marcus Poetry Reading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also supported by the THI/Bookshop alliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of its first collaborations, THI and Bookshop presented a reading by the law professor, author and activist Anita Hill, whose life changed forever</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1991 when a television audience of 22 million saw her testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Judge Clarence Thomas.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her calm demeanor&#8212;as she was pressed to endlessly repeat the graphic descriptions of sexual harassment she endured while working for Thomas&#8212;struck a chord with the public and began a conversation about sexual harassment and power in the workplace that still resonates today. She delivered a public lecture called &#8220;S</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">peaking Truth to Power: Gender and Racial Equality, 1991&#8211;2015.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, THI and Bookshop presented a reading by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madeleine Albright, the United States&#8217; first female Secretary of State. She spoke about her book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fascism: A Warning. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, THI and Bookshop Santa Cruz also hosted a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;reading by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Colson Whitehead.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This impactful partnership has drawn strong support from community leaders and philanthropists such as Gail Michaelis-Ow and George Ow, Jr..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Two of the many treasures that make Santa Cruz an amazing place to live are Bookshop Santa Cruz and The Humanities Institute at UCSC,&#8221; Gail Michaelis-Ow said. &#8220;And when these two entities unite, magic happens.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A &#8220;Deep&#8221; dive into reading</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of THI/Bookshop&#8217;s most successful projects is the <a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/deepread/">Deep Read,</a> a program that is all about reading deeply into works of literature with the input of UCSC scholars. These deep dives into books include expert panels, weekly &#8220;email explorations,&#8221; community conversations, and salon-style events in which professors lead UCSC students in discussions of the chosen books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deep Read initiative kicked off in 2020 with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margaret Atwood, author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and widely considered one of the most influential authors of the 20th century. The Deep Read focused on Atwood&#8217;s 2019 novel,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Testaments.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s Deep Read selection is <em>U</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nder a White Sky: The Nature of the Future</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Pulitzer Prize-winning science journalist Elizabeth Kolbert</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This nonfiction book explores the role that human ingenuity has played in creating climate change and the role it plays now in creating a sustainable future. <a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4582&amp;cid=10205">This year&#8217;s program will culminate in a live discussion of </a></span><a href="https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4582&amp;cid=10205"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under A White</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Kolbert in conversation with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> columnist, podcast host and UCSC alumnus Ezra Klein on May 21 at the Quarry Amphitheater.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC Humanities Dean Jasmine Alinder called Deep Read &#8220;one of THI&#8217;s signature achievements, and a cornerstone of its ongoing partnership with Bookshop Santa Cruz.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"The Humanities build bridges between disciplines and provide a rich historical and ethical framework for problem solving," Alinder said. "All too often, the Humanities get pushed to the margins at the times when we need them the most. The THI/Bookshop collaboration brings us authors who show us </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Humanities are essential in the 21st century.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Deep Read is all about getting beneath the surface of these issues at a time of fractured attention spans and political division,&#8221; Alinder said. &#8220;The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Read is also a great example of enduring and meaningful community collaboration.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deep Read initiative is made possible by the support of the Helen and Will Webster Foundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A chance meeting, and an enduring friendship&#160;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The THI/Bookshop alliance arose because of a chance meeting that resulted in friendship. A few years ago, Poli&#263;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Bookshop Santa Cruz owner Casey Coonerty Protti </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">struck up a conversation because both of them were hanging out in a schoolyard while their children were running around, enjoying recess.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started chatting, and Protti told Poli&#263; about her role at the bookstore. Immediately, Poli&#263; thought about the possibilities of an event partnership, and how Bookshop Santa Cruz could help THI expand its reach and attract a greater array of writers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protti, in turn, wanted Bookshop to have a greater presence at UCSC, given the fact that this store is not just a bookseller but an intellectual hub and meeting place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had the same vision from a different perspective,&#8221; Protti said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In bringing more authors to town, UCSC/THI was filling a hole in the literary scene that the beloved midtown bookseller Capitola Book Caf&#233; left when it closed in 2014 after 34 years of operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bookshop Santa Cruz always put on a poetry festival, and we have always done events,&#8221; Protti said. &#8220;But the fact was that the Capitola Book Caf&#233; was known for their events more than any other bookstore in the area. Events were part of their brand. Indie bookstores are cooperative. We never wanted to become an event center and step on their toes. When they closed, we realized that we wanted to get into the game, and we made a strategic decision to go big on events. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We couldn't imagine doing that without UC Santa Cruz."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the year of readings is still underway, Protti and Poli&#263;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are already busy bringing more authors to town for the 2024 season.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of hard to believe now, but I remember a time when Santa Cruz was not on the literary map the way it is now,&#8221; Protti recalled. &#8220;I used to go to New York and ask authors&#8217; publicists to schedule book talks in our town. And I had to convince them. They would ask, &#8216;is Santa Cruz near LA?&#8217; I&#8217;d have to make the case that it was worth adding a second stop in California when they thought Santa Cruz was in the middle of nowhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But one way of getting on the map is mentioning our partnership with the THI,&#8221;&#8217; Protti said. &#8220;That carries a lot of weight because they know this is a culturally rich environment where people take books seriously, and where readers will come out to support their favorite authors. And that was our mission all along&#8212;to make the literary community bigger and brighter in Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through rigorous research and scholarship, community partnerships, and innovative programs, UC Santa Cruz is driving meaningful change and making a real difference in the lives of individuals and communities locally, nationally, and globally. From promoting social justice and environmental sustainability to advancing groundbreaking research, UC Santa Cruz is a force for good, and its students, staff, faculty, and alumni are working tirelessly to create a better, more equitable world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students are trailblazers, actively working to champion a better tomorrow. Determined to make a positive impact on the world, they combine their co-curricular leadership initiatives and experiences with their academic pursuits to advocate for change, justice, and equity,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Akirah Bradley-Armstrong. &#8220;They come to UC Santa Cruz wanting to make the world a better place and leave even more equipped to do so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marisol Ornelas (Stevenson &#8216;24, politics and legal studies) is one of the many students at UC Santa Cruz who strives to make a positive impact on their world. She is working to remedy the many obstacles on the road to higher education. A first-generation student, Ornelas&#8217;s passions include giving back to her community, student activism, and labor and education policy.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ornelas currently works as a paralegal assistant with Medina Paralegal Services, is a community engagement intern with local nonprofit Senderos, and is an intern with nonprofit organization, Women In Leadership for Diverse Representation. She is working toward combating the rising cost of a college education and offers guidance for students to take advantage of the many resources UC Santa Cruz has to offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz has long been recognized as a leader in higher education, with a strong commitment to academic excellence and innovation. The campus pairs high-impact research with 10 tight-knit undergraduate residential colleges that offer students the experience of a small liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university. The colleges are guided by distinct themes that inform their academic and student life programs.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its outstanding academic programs, UC Santa Cruz is also known for its commitment to social justice and sustainability. The university is home to a diverse student body, with students from all over the world, and offers a wide range of student activities and organizations that promote civic engagement and community service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz is one of only four universities to share the distinction of being a member of the Association of American Universities and designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution. Last year, UC Santa Cruz joined other leading universities to form the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/06/alliance-hispanic-serving-research-universities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance of Hispanic Serving Research Universities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a coalition dedicated to increasing opportunities for those historically underserved by higher education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton Review developed the ranking using student ratings and responses to survey questions covering community service opportunities at their school, student government, sustainability efforts, and on-campus student engagement. The ranking also factored in PayScale.com&#8217;s percentage of alumni from each school that reported having high job meaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton Review also ranked UC Santa Cruz the </span><a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-best-value-colleges-public-schools"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. 31 Best Value Public School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States for 2023, recognition reflecting the campus's commitment to academic excellence, affordability, and social responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list is based on a comprehensive assessment of more than 650 colleges and universities across the country. The rankings take into account factors such as academics, cost of attendance, financial aid, and career prospects for graduates.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="216c2f8d807270464b3782179483e9d4"><name>clock-regulation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Study reveals key molecular interaction that sets the timing of our biological clocks</title><summary>New findings point toward a promising target for the development of therapies for sleep disorders, jet lag, and other effects of clock disruption.</summary><keywords>Carrie Partch</keywords><start-date>1684422000000</start-date><display-name>Study reveals key molecular interaction that sets the timing of our biological clocks</display-name><path>/2023/05/clock-regulation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/clock-regulation</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1684187918205</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684421883485</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/waking-up-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/waking-up-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>waking-up-400.jpg</name><display-name>waking-up-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>70437</file-size><width>400</width><height>396</height></image><image-alt>person waking as the sun rises</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/waking-up-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/waking-up-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>waking-up-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>waking-up-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>16529</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>person waking as the sun rises</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Molecular interactions drive the biological clocks in our cells, synchronizing our bodies with the 24-hour cycle of night and day.

Scientists studying the molecular mechanisms of our biological clocks have now identified a key event that controls the timing of the clock.</p>
<p>The new findings, <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2023.04.019">published May 18 in <em>Molecular Cell</em></a>, reveal important details of the molecular interactions that are disrupted in people with an inherited sleep disorder called Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASP). The syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation that shortens the timing of the clock, making people extreme &#8220;morning larks&#8221; because their internal clocks operate on a 20-hour cycle instead of being synchronized with the 24-hour cycle of our planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like having permanent jet lag, because their internal clock never gets caught up with the daylength,&#8221; said corresponding author Carrie Partch, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The FASP mutation was discovered 20 years ago, and we knew it had a huge effect, but we didn&#8217;t know how or why.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FASP mutation affects one of the core clock proteins, called Period, changing a single amino acid in the protein&#8217;s structure. The new study shows how this one change disrupts the Period protein&#8217;s interactions with a kinase enzyme (casein kinase 1), decreasing the stability of the Period protein and shortening an important step in the clock cycle.</p>
<p>First author Jonathan Philpott, a postdoctoral researcher in Partch&#8217;s lab at UCSC, explained that the kinase enzyme regulates Period by attaching phosphate groups (a process called phosphorylation), and there are two different parts of the protein where it can do this. Phosphorylation of the &#8220;degron&#8221; region tags the Period protein for degradation, whereas phosphorylation of the FASP region stabilizes it. The balance between degradation and stabilization determines the length of the clock cycle, and the FASP mutation tilts the balance toward degradation of Period and shortening of the cycle.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s about a four-hour shortening of the clock when you have this FASP mutation,&#8221; Philpott said.</p>
<p>An important finding of the new study is that the phosphorylated FASP region inhibits the activity of the kinase. This feedback inhibition mechanism enables Period to effectively regulate its own regulator, slowing the phosphorylation of the degron region and lengthening the cycle. &#8220;We need this pause button to slow down what would otherwise be very fast biochemistry,&#8221; Partch said.</p>
<p>The researchers showed that the inhibition results from binding of the phosphorylated FASP region to a particular site on the kinase, which could potentially be targeted by a drug.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can start thinking about this as a tunable system,&#8221; Philpott said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve identified regions on the kinase that are potentially targetable to tune its activity for therapeutic applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partch noted that most drugs that target kinases work by blocking the active site of the enzyme. &#8220;That&#8217;s basically a hammer that turns off the kinase activity,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But with the discovery of new pockets unique to this kinase, we can target those to modulate its activity in a more controlled way.&#8221;</p>
<p>This could help not only people with Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome, but also people whose sleep cycles are disrupted by shift work, jet lag, and other challenges of the modern world.</p>
<p>Another striking finding in the new study is that the feedback inhibition of the kinase enzyme by the Period protein also occurs in fruit flies, even though the phosphorylation sites are different.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out the short-cycle mutant in <em>Drosophila</em>, discovered in 1970, does the same thing as the short-cycle FASP mutation in humans,&#8221; Partch said. &#8220;This mechanism has likely been in place throughout the evolution of multicellular animals. The fact that it&#8217;s been rooted in place for such a long time suggest it&#8217;s fundamental to making biological clocks on Earth have a 24-hour cycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partch and Philpott said their collaborations with multiple labs at other institutions enabled them to go beyond their experimental observations to study the clock mechanisms from a variety of angles. The study included the use of NMR spectroscopy, simulations of molecular dynamics, and genetically engineered human cell lines, as well as characterization of the same molecular mechanisms in humans and <em>Drosophila</em> fruit flies.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a terrific collaborative team,&#8221; Partch said.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s graduate alumni are at the forefront of change on a local, national, and international stage. From groundbreaking film research, to spearheading technological advances, preserving nations&#8217; history, combating climate change, and shifting economic landscapes, UCSC alumni are making a tremendous impact worldwide.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five graduate alumni representing each academic division&#8212;</span><strong>Benjam&#237;n</strong> <strong>Schultz Figueroa</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Arts), </span><strong>Jennifer Bevan</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Baskin Engineering), </span><strong>James E. Young</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Humanities), </span><strong>Cora Randall</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Physical and Biological Sciences), and </span><strong>Jake Kendall</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Social Sciences)&#8212;have been named UCSC&#8217;s 2023 Distinguished Graduate Alumni.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This prestigious award honors the extraordinary accomplishments of division graduates in diverse fields. Graduate Studies Division Professional Development Coordinator and Event Organizer Sonya Newlyn is excited to announce this year&#8217;s cohort.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now in its seventh year, the Distinguished Graduate Student Alumni Award shines a spotlight on exceptional graduate alumni,&#8221; Newlyn says. &#8220;The 2023 honorees have pursued a range of academic to alternative-academic careers and serve as prominent examples of the power of graduate education.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cora Randall, Benjam&#237;n Schultz-Figueroa, and James E. Young took the academic path, but their spheres of influence extend far beyond their institutions&#8212;quite literally, in Randall&#8217;s case, into Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and outer space! Schultz-Figueroa and Young, in their respective areas of research, help us remember the past, preserve its lessons, and remind us that the past rightly plays an important role in shaping how we construct our present and future world.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jennifer Bevan and Jake Kendall took non-academic paths that have had a global impact and directly improved the human experience. UC Santa Cruz, the Graduate Division, the five academic divisions, and the programs that bestowed their graduate degrees&#8212;film and digital media, computer science, literature, chemistry, and economics&#8212;take this moment to thank and honor Drs. Bevan, Kendall, Randall, Schultz-Figueroa, and Young for their contributions to education, research and discovery, preservation, and invention, and for their drive to make a better world for all.&#8221;</span></p>
<h4><strong>Benjam&#237;n Schultz-Figueroa (Ph.D. &#8217;18, film and digital media)</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjam&#237;n Schultz-Figueroa is at the cutting edge of groundbreaking research in film history, science studies, and animal studies. His interdisciplinary approach to animal representation in film gives Schultz-Figueroa a fresh perspective on a decades-old topic.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schultz-Figueroa is a professor of film studies at Seattle University and has most recently taught courses in the history of film, animals and film, science and the cinema, science fiction film, and film theory. He is also currently co-editing multiple pieces, including a special issue of the Journal of Environmental Media, an in-focus issue of the Journal of Cinema and Media Studies, and an issue of feminist media histories on gender and non theatrical film. In addition, Schultz-Figueroa is working on his second book project, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beastly Futures</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beastly Futures </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks at the non-theatrical and theatrical representation of animals in the 21st century,&#8221; Schultz-Figueroa said. &#8220;It particularly looks at this new genre of animal representations called multi-species documentary and gives some political and historical context for understanding those films.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schultz-Figueroa says Shelley Stamp, UCSC Professor of Film &amp; Digital Media and Affiliated Faculty for Feminist Studies, Visual Studies, had a tremendous impact on him and his work while at UCSC, and he is grateful for his fellow Ph.D. cohort.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shelley Stamp has been such a tireless advocate for me and my work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My Ph.D. cohort of students also taught me so much. I&#8217;m so thankful that I could be with all of them during my time at UCSC.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at UCSC his dissertation was awarded the graduate student writing award from the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, the discipline&#8217;s highest honor for graduate students. Schultz-Figueroa&#8217;s groundbreaking dissertation was published earlier this year as </span><a href="https://luminosoa.org/site/books/m/10.1525/luminos.145/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Celluloid Specimen</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s free to the public.&#160;</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jennifer Bevan (Ph.D. &#8217;06, computer science)</strong></span></h4>
<p><a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/news/alumna-jennifer-bevan-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Bevan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was recruited to Google before finishing her Ph.D. at UCSC and has been with the company since 2006. She was instrumental in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eveloping testing infrastructure and tools to improve products and the end-user experience.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of those efforts because they were really reliable,&#8221; Bevan said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve built foundations for technology that has grown and adapted but not fundamentally changed. It&#8217;s been very stable.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before attending UCSC, Bevan had worked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in automating radio science analyses</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she became fascinated with how code evolves over time and the desire to improve it.&#160;<span>Pursuing her Ph.D. at UCSC led her to gain an appreciation for software engineering, especially testing, so Bevan decided to take up Google's offer.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bevan has spent 17 years at Google and played a part in developing several Google products, such as Google Photos and Google+, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google&#8217;s social networking platform that ran from 2011 to 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, she led multiple projects geared towards increasing accessibility on Google platforms&#8212;particularly Google Photos.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the end of the day, Google Photos did not change its launch schedule, and it was accessible on all platforms at launch,&#8221; Bevan said. &#8220;That was one of the biggest things I&#8217;m proud of.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bevan says she is grateful for her time at UC Santa Cruz and for the mentorship of Jim Whitehead.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz in general, and Jim Whitehead in particular, gave me that balance of autonomy and structure to where I could take the ideas I had and run with them.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h4><strong>James E. Young (Stevenson &#8217;73, literature and psychology) (Ph.D. &#8217;83, literature)</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James E. Young is at the forefront of memorializing historical tragedies internationally. From advising on memorials in Germany and Norway to helping design the 9/11 Memorial in New York City, Young has had a hand in preserving the memory of thousands of lives lost to global tragedies.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young is a Distinguished University Professor Emeritus of English and Judaic &amp; Near Eastern Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he has taught since 1988, and Founding Director of the Institute for Holocaust, Genocide, and Memory Studies at UMass Amherst.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young is the author of multiple publications including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing and Rewriting the Holocaust</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Texture of Memory</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;which was awarded the National Jewish Book Award in 1994&#8212;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Memory&#8217;s Edge: After-images of the Holocaust in Contemporary Art and Architecture,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stages of Memory: Reflections on Memorial Art, Loss, and the Spaces Between</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;awarded the National Council for Public History Book Award for 2017.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Young has written widely for national and international publications including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, and more. His writings have also appeared in over a dozen scholarly journals.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now retired, Young has kept himself busy with meaningful projects worldwide. He has lent his expertise to architectural teams working on memorials for the Tree of Life Synagogue and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, both tragic events that claimed the lives of many innocent people.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These jobs are not things that I look for, but they find you,&#8221; Young says. &#8220;And I&#8217;m glad to help. My role in these projects is not to tell anybody what to do but to have a dialogue and get to the best and most effective commemoration possible. We hope commemoration that leads to action or arches toward justice in some way.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young grew up in Santa Cruz and attended UCSC for his undergraduate and graduate education. He says multiple faculty members inspired and helped him along the way. </span></p>
<h4><strong>Cora Randall (MS &#8217;83, chemistry) (Ph.D. &#8217;85, chemistry)</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cora Randall has played a vital role in our understanding of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, particularly in polar regions, and has been instrumental in developing tools dedicated to better understanding the universe. She has worked with NASA for over three decades on the Hubble Space Telescope and later on satellite missions devoted to examining the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. She primarily investigates processes related to stratospheric ozone depletion, polar mesospheric clouds, and atmospheric coupling through solar and magnetospheric energetic particle precipitation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Randall&#8217;s work includes a focus on the atmospheric impacts of rocket launches using data from the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re considering proposing a new instrument as a follow-on to the AIM Satellite that would be launched in the next five years or so, and could continue making these kinds of measurements,&#8221; Randall said. &#8220;The fundamental goal here is to better quantify how natural and anthropogenic&#8212;or man-made&#8212;forces impact the atmosphere because that will enable us to better predict both weather and climate change.&#8221;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A science path was not always in the cards for Randall. Early in her college career, she contemplated going into music studies, but a run-in with UCSC alum Atom Yee at the State University of New York at Purchase led her to UCSC. At UCSC, Randall pursued a Ph.D. in chemistry under David Kliger&#8212;a friend of Atom Yee.&#160;&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was just fantastic,&#8221; Randall said. &#8220;It felt like home being in grad school at UCSC. And, of course, Dave&#8212;a world-renowned expert in his field&#8212;imparted so much knowledge to me. He was patient, generous with his time, and unendingly encouraging.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Randall is a Professor Emerita in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and a senior scientist at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has won several awards for her scientific contributions and service and is an elected fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Jake Kendall (Ph.D. &#8217;08, economics)</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Kendall is at the forefront of investing in African digital commerce startups. He is a co-founder and partner at DFS Lab, a team of people who empower communities through mentorship and strategic advice to early-stage startups.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is that we see a big opportunity to invest in Africa, especially technology spaces around digitizing the economy,&#8221; Kendall said. &#8220;It&#8217;s an economy that&#8217;s very informal, very cash-based, and not much technology is applied. We invest in entrepreneurs across Africa solving this need and building solutions for the local context.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kendall has been investing in African digital platforms since the launch of M-Pesa, a revolutionary digital money-sharing application that transformed the economy of many African countries. Previously, Kendall has worked for both the World Bank as an economist with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the Gates Foundation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake is a published researcher and author with a Ph.D. in economics from UCSC and a B.S. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After MIT, he spent two years in Zambia as a fisheries extension agent with the US Peace Corps. He says UCSC&#8217;s international focus on economics drew him to the university.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The skill set I learned at UC Santa Cruz&#8212;which is having a careful process around creating data, understanding data and analysis, and rigorous thinking&#8212;I apply some of that thinking to business models, to investment decisions, and to understanding some of the products that we&#8217;re helping launch,&#8221; Kendall said. &#8220;I use them all across the board.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Tickets for the <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/music-of-the-spheres/">Music of the Spheres</a> and <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/evening-with-the-stars/">Evening with the Stars</a> events are on sale now at <a href="https://lickobservatory.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>. Additional opportunities to experience Lick Observatory at night are offered through the <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/public-evening-tours/">Public Evening Tours</a> and <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/events/photography-nights/">Photography Nights</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Some of these events are already sold out, but tickets remain available for many dates throughout the summer. </strong>For dates, additional details, and ticket information, visit the Lick Observatory event listings on <a href="https://lickobservatory.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>.</p>
<p>Each <em>Music of the Spheres</em> concert features a musical performance, an astronomy lecture by a scientist, and a history presentation about Lick Observatory&#8217;s rich past. Afterward, guests take turns viewing celestial objects through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector. Guests have additional opportunities to stargaze with small ground telescopes provided by amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>The <em>Evenings with the Stars</em> program gives the public a chance to view through the 36-inch Great Lick Refractor and the 40-inch Nickel Reflector as well. Similar to the Music of the Spheres events, each program features an astronomy lecture by a &#8220;star&#8221; scientist and a history presentation. Amateur astronomers also set up ground telescopes so that guests can get additional telescope time.</p>
<p>The Public Evening Tours offer an expert-guided, four- to six-hour "behind-the-scenes" walking tour of Lick Observatory. Participants can learn about the unique history of the world&#8217;s first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory, the eccentric California pioneer James Lick, technology used for observing on different telescopes along the tour route, and current science being conducted at Lick Observatory. After dark and weather permitting, guests can view celestial objects through the historic 36-inch Great Refractor telescope.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Mount Hamilton Road. Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory is at the forefront of astronomical research as an active research facility. It is operated by the University of California Observatories (UCO), a multi-campus research unit that serves eight UC campuses and is headquartered at UC Santa Cruz. More information is available online at <a href="https://www.lickobservatory.org/">www.lickobservatory.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Weather may restrict telescope viewings, but other activities will still take place.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of the systemwide advocacy effort UC Day, Chancellor Cynthia Larive and other campus representatives met with California elected officials who represent the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley regions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larive called the Sacramento visit a &#8220;valuable opportunity to highlight the remarkable work we do on our campus and throughout the system &#8212; work that benefits our students, the state and the world. I believe it leaves a lasting impression with many legislators and shows the deep impact we have when we work in partnership.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz delegation shared its support for a 2023-24 state budget proposal that maintains the consistent funding investments under the five-year budget compact &#8212; increases that were also supported by the state Legislature in last year&#8217;s budget.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliable funding commitments from the state will allow the University of California to make critical investments including expanding undergraduate enrollment and hiring the next generation of faculty. In addition, the delegation spoke about the need for more state support for student housing and capital funding to support student success on our campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz delegation included Vice Chancellor for University Relations Mark Delos Reyes Davis, Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Success and Equity Ebon&#233;e Williams, Special Assistant to the Chancellor Larry Samuels, Executive Director of Government and Community Relations Melissa Whatley, Foundation Board Trustee Loren Kinczel, and Alumni Council past President Meredith Turner.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus representatives met with state Senators John Laird (Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo counties), Dave Cortese (Santa Clara County), and Josh Becker (San Mateo County), as well as Assemblymembers Gail Pellerin (Santa Cruz, Los Gatos,&#160; Morgan Hill), Robert Rivas (Watsonville, Salinas), Dawn Addis (Monterey, Marina, San Luis Obispo), Ash Kalra (San Jose), Evan Low (Cupertino, Santa Clara), and Marc Berman (Northern Santa Clara and southern San Mateo counties).&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="252a5184807270464a9ae84e62a506e7"><name>shr-announcement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>New director of Labor &amp; Employee Relations </title><summary>We are pleased to announce that Andrew Slobodien will be joining Staff Human Resources (SHR) as our next Director of Employee and Labor Relations.</summary><start-date>1684220400000</start-date><path>/2023/05/shr-announcement</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/shr-announcement</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1684250710385</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684779001414</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am pleased to announce that Andrew Slobodien will be joining Staff Human Resources (SHR) as our next Director of Employee and Labor Relations effective June 1, 2023.&#160; He will report to me and have oversight of our employee and labor relations team.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slobodien brings 29 years of experience as a labor attorney working in the public and private sectors. Before establishing a private law practice, he was lead negotiator and contract administrator for unions at the state of Illinois&#8217; largest public university/hospital system - the University of Illinois, Chicago - leading the interface with faculty, residents, nurses, police, security and service worker unions. Andrew was the managing attorney for labor relations at the Chicago Public Schools, directing and coordinating the response for all labor litigation for the country&#8217;s third-largest school district. He also worked as a labor, employment and litigation partner in the private sector and a senior associate litigating labor and employee disputes in federal and state courts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I extend appreciation to the search committee members for their work reviewing and interviewing the candidates.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also thank the entire Labor and Employee Relations team for taking on additional responsibilities through this transition.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professor Taylor will address the history of African American studies, its connection to political struggle, and the significance of the recent College Board&#8217;s actions to remove units on intersectionality and activism, Black queer studies, &#8220;Black Feminist Literary Thought,&#8221; reparations, and &#8220;Black Study and the Black Struggle in the 21st Century&#8221; from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Advanced Placement class in African American studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Taylor is a professor in the Department of African American Studies at Northwestern University and a scholar of racism and inequality, with a focus on U.S. housing policies. Taylor critiques public-private partnerships in public policymaking and the influence of market-based solutions in resolving trenchant social inequities. Taylor also studies radical politics and Black social movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. She is a contributing writer for The New Yorker and the author of three books, including the award-winning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was a semifinalist for the National Book Award and a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize in History.&#160;</span></p>

UCSC graduates in software earn a $119,458 average yearly salary, which is a $16,104 premium over the median graduate, and those in data science fields earn a $109,026 average yearly salary, a $8,703 premium over the median graduate.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Students at the UCSC Baskin School of Engineering can study a variety of engineering disciplines across six departments, including highly ranked programs in computer science and engineering, robotics, applied mathematics, and computational media. <a href="https://iraps.ucsc.edu/iraps-public-dashboards/student-outcomes/first-destination-survey.html">Among UCSC students</a>, students who majored in engineering report high salaries in their first jobs after college as compared to their peers, putting them on the path to social mobility. The computer science and engineering programs are very popular &#8212; 2020 rankings from American Society for Engineering Education showed that UCSC awarded the fifth most total bachelor's degrees in computer science in the country.<br/><br/>Many of the Baskin Engineering programs emphasize learning the modern directions of the information technology industry, with a focus on areas such as big data and autonomous vehicles. An emphasis on experiential learning means that students are embedded within an active research environment with a focus on developing new technology for social good.<br/><br/>The rankings also reflect UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s access and ties to Silicon Valley where Baskin Engineering graduates are in high demand. The UCSC Silicon Valley campus is a multidisciplinary hub for research and teaching relevant to the current tech and engineering industry, with programs in human-computer interaction, natural language processing, and more.&#160;<br/><br/>The Wall Street Journal gathered this data from a Burning Glass Institute analysis of experience and pay data from Lightcast, a labor-market data firm, and Glassdoor, a company-ratings website. For each college, an annual salary premium was calculated using the difference between the earnings of the school&#8217;s graduates in their first 10 years after graduation and the median graduate in the field.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2598fc18807270464a9ae84eb616d6f2"><name>campus-elections-update-vote-now</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Vote Now in 2023 Campus Elections</title><summary>Students are invited to cast their votes on important campus initiatives such SUA constitutional amendments, student fee measures, opinion polls, and officer elections for undergraduate and graduate student government. </summary><start-date>1684134000000</start-date><display-name>Vote Now in 2023 Campus Elections</display-name><path>/2023/05/campus-elections-update-vote-now</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/campus-elections-update-vote-now</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1684257963008</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684258006063</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>&#160;</p>

Randall</strong>, pediatrician <strong>Ramon Resa</strong>, and marine scientist <strong>Colleen Reichmuth</strong>&#8212;with the 2023 Distinguished Alumni Awards in recognition of their achievements and contributions.</p>
<p>The division established the awards to honor graduates of the division who have gone on to extraordinary accomplishments in diverse fields and whose careers are characterized by sustained and exemplary contributions to society through research, practice, education, policy, or service.</p>
<h2>Colleen Reichmuth</h2>
<p>A triple-degree holder from UC Santa Cruz, Colleen Reichmuth is a senior research scientist at UCSC&#8217;s Institute of Marine Sciences, studying comparative cognition, bioacoustics, and behavioral ecology with a focus on amphibious marine mammals. Reichmuth earned her B.A. in biology, M.S. in marine sciences, and Ph.D. in ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz and has spent most of her career at Long Marine Laboratory, where she heads the <a href="https://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/">Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Lab</a>. Her team carries out diverse lab and field studies of seals, sea lions, walruses, and sea otters to explore how these semi-aquatic carnivores have evolved to operate within terrestrial and marine habitats.</p>
<p>Projects in Reichmuth&#8217;s lab address challenging conservation problems such as ocean noise, harmful algal blooms, climate change, and habitat loss, often centered on the behavior and biology of individual animals. At heart, her research uses psychobiological approaches to better understand how animals experience the world around them, including how they solve problems, cope with stressors, and communicate with one another. An advocate for best practices for animal welfare in research, Reichmuth is a National Geographic Explorer, serves on the Committee of Scientific Advisors for the Society for Marine Mammalogy, and has been recognized as a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America. As a first-generation American and first-generation college student, she credits her parents with instilling a love of learning that is best shared with others.</p>
<h2>Cora E. Randall</h2>
<p>Cora Randall is a senior research scientist in the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and distinguished professor emerita in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (ATOC) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. She earned her Ph.D. in chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz in 1985.</p>
<p>After an initial career focused on time-resolved laser spectroscopy of biological molecules, Randall spent 33 years working first on the Hubble Space Telescope and later on satellite missions devoted to examining Earth's atmosphere. She has led numerous research programs and is currently deputy principal investigator for the NASA Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite mission and principal investigator for the AIM Cloud Imaging and Particle Size instrument. Her professional work has ranged from polarization optics to astronomy to atmospheric science and solar-terrestrial relationships. Her current research emphasizes the atmospheric effects of energetic particle precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion, polar mesospheric clouds, gravity wave observations, and satellite measurement validation. She chaired the CU Boulder ATOC Department for five years and has led many university activities, including a four-year overhaul of the undergraduate general education requirements. She has won many awards in recognition of her scientific contributions and service and is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<h2>Ramon Resa</h2>
<p>Dr. Ramon Resa was raised in the tiny community of Goshen, CA, near Fresno. One of 15 children raised by his grandparents in a world of poverty, neglect, and disregard for education, Dr. Resa credits his grade-school teachers with opening his eyes to the idea of going to college and becoming a doctor. He earned his B.A. in biology at UC Santa Cruz in 1976. Upon completing his medical education, Dr. Resa returned to the San Joaquin Valley to open a pediatric practice in Porterville, CA, where he has spent three decades working with poor and underserved children.</p>
<p>Dr. Resa&#8217;s memoir <em>Out of the Fields: My Journey from Farmworker Boy to Pediatrician</em> shares how he found the courage to pursue his vision of becoming a doctor. Through his book, public appearances, and blogs, Dr. Resa has educated and inspired parents, students, educators, medical professionals, and business groups across the country to keep hopes and dreams alive, even when there is no visible evidence that our dreams can come true.</p>
<p>Dr. Resa is featured in a documentary film, <a href="https://calendar.ucsc.edu/event/world_premiere_movie_screening_of_told_they_cant_featuring_2023_uc_santa_cruz_distinguished_science_alum_dr_ramon_resa"><em>Told They Can&#8217;t</em></a>, which will be shown at the Humanities Lecture Hall on Friday, May 20, at 4:30 p.m. The film tells the inspiring stories of several professionals of color who succeeded despite the odds being stacked against them in childhood. The screening will be followed by a moderated discussion between Diane Wagner, executive producer, and Dr. Resa himself.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="26956b30807270464a9ae84ed9a2c4a8"><name>massoud-berlin-prize</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Mark Fathi Massoud awarded Berlin Prize</title><summary>Massoud's Berlin Prize fellowship will allow him to focus on research about perceptions and experiences of shari‘a in the United States. </summary><start-date>1684220400000</start-date><path>/2023/05/massoud-berlin-prize</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/massoud-berlin-prize</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1684274506522</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684274911824</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Politics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/mmassoud.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/mmassoud.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>mmassoud.jpeg</name><display-name>mmassoud.jpeg</display-name><file-size>10990</file-size><width>296</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>professional portrait of Mark Massoud</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2021/05/images/massoud-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2021/05/images/massoud-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>massoud-80.jpg</name><display-name>massoud-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>20514</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>professional portrait of Mark Massoud</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Fathi Massoud</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Fathi Massoud, professor of politics and director of legal studies at UC Santa Cruz, was recently named among 26 Berlin Prize winners for the upcoming academic year. The </span><a href="https://www.americanacademy.de/the-2023-24-berlin-prize-fellows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin Prize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is awarded annually to US-based scholars, writers, composers, and artists who represent the highest standards of excellence in their fields, from the humanities and social sciences to journalism, public policy, fiction, the visual arts, and music composition. Massoud was named a Berlin Prize Fellow for Spring 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prize provides recipients with the time and resources to focus on advancing important scholarly and artistic projects. Massoud will focus on perceptions and experiences of shari&#8216;a in the United States. At the Academy, Massoud will be studying the history of religious exclusion in the United States and the ways that Muslims turn to shari&#8216;a, commonly translated as Islamic law, as a guide to ethical living and a source of democratic values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This lived experience stands in contrast to the monolithic projection of shari&#8216;a as a threat to Western political liberalism and the rule of law,&#8221; Massoud said, adding that more than 200 anti-shari&#8216;a bills have been introduced across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Berlin Prize Fellow, Massoud will work throughout the 2024 spring semester with Berlin peers and institutions in the Academy&#8217;s network, forging transatlantic relationships. During their stays, fellows engage German audiences through lectures, readings, and performances. The American Academy in Berlin is a private, nonpartisan, nonprofit institution of advanced scholarship dedicated to upholding the cultural, academic, and political ties between the United States and Germany.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a7ae37f807270465bc2f86a736c7ed4"><name>salmon-documentary</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Salmon documentary produced by UCSC team to air on KQED</title><summary>‘Southern Range’ was directed by Soc Doc alumnus Kyle Baker and produced by the Seymour Center and the Fisheries Collaborative Program at UCSC.</summary><keywords>Eric Palkovacs, Jonathan Hicken</keywords><start-date>1684306800000</start-date><display-name>Salmon documentary produced by UCSC team to air on KQED</display-name><path>/2023/05/salmon-documentary</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/salmon-documentary</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1684339876717</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684767633019</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/southern-range-500.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/southern-range-500.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>southern-range-500.jpg</name><display-name>southern-range-500.jpg</display-name><file-size>117821</file-size><width>500</width><height>500</height></image><image-alt>salmon illustration with film title</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/southern-range-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/southern-range-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>southern-range-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>southern-range-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>14305</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>salmon illustration</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>‘Southern Range’ was directed by Soc Doc alumnus Kyle Baker and produced by the Seymour Center and the Fisheries Collaborative Program at UCSC</article-subhead><article-text><p>A documentary film about salmon struggling to survive at the southern edge of their range, produced by the <a href="https://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> and the <a href="https://fisheries.ucsc.edu/">Fisheries Collaborative Program</a> at UC Santa Cruz, will air on the Bay Area public television station <a href="https://www.kqed.org/">KQED</a> in June.</p>
<p><em>Southern Range: Salmon in the Santa Cruz Mountains</em> was directed by UCSC alumnus Kyle Baker, who earned his MFA in social documentation in 2020. The film explores the deep and tangled relationships between salmon, fire, human beings, and our shared environment.</p>
<p>The documentary will air on KQED in two prominent slots in June: Friday, June 2, at 8:30 p.m. and Wednesday, June 21, at 8 p.m. (streaming live at&#160;<a href="https://kqed.org/livetv">kqed.org/livetv</a>). It will also air on the KQED PLUS channel on Friday, June 9, at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Eric Palkovacs, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Fisheries Collaborative Program, and Jonathan Hicken, executive director of the Seymour Center, worked closely with Baker to bring the project to fruition.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a collaborative project from day one,&#8221; Hicken said. &#8220;Eric brought his expertise in fisheries science, I brought community connections, and Kyle brought the creativity to tell the story of our local salmon and the community-based efforts to help them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Palkovacs and Baker first met when Baker was filming a series of short interviews about salmon for another project (see <a href="https://vimeo.com/610229639/3c282abf14">Salmon Nation interview</a>). At the time, they discussed the idea of a longer documentary and agreed to keep in touch. Then the CZU Lightning Complex wildfire burned through the Santa Cruz Mountains in 2020, creating new challenges for the endangered coho salmon population on the Central Coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;That gave us a central theme for the documentary that pulled together the scientists, the folks at the hatchery, conservationists, the angling community&#8212;everyone was focused on the impacts of the fire and climate change,&#8221; Palkovacs said.</p>
<p>Scientists at UCSC and NOAA have been working closely with conservation organizations and local groups on salmon recovery efforts in the Scott Creek watershed, which hosts the only remaining coho salmon population south of the Golden Gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an iconic species that depends on the health of the forests and the freshwater and ocean habitats, and they are increasingly challenged by climate change,&#8221; Palkovacs said. &#8220;This story is about more than salmon&#8212;it&#8217;s indicative of our overall situation and relevant to the fates of a lot of species in a rapidly changing climate.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Southern Range</em> had its premiere at the Seymour Center last year during Salmon Week and has since been selected for screening at four film festivals.</p>
<p>&#8220;This film proves that combining science, culture, and community-based climate adaptation makes for compelling stories,&#8221; Hicken said. &#8220;Countless other stories are out there, and I implore anyone with a similar story to approach us at the Seymour Center. Let&#8217;s see if there&#8217;s a way to share your story, too.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>06-23-2023</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2ab3efd6807270465bc2f86a26108f94"><name>animal-siblings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Comb jellies proven to be the sibling group to all other animals</title><summary>New research proves comb jellies are a unique lineage or “sibling group” whose ancestors diverged before the common ancestor of all other animals.</summary><start-date>1684339200000</start-date><path>/2023/05/animal-siblings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/animal-siblings</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1684343615426</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684865798565</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf (UCSC) and Raúl Nava (MBARI)</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/combjelly_425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/combjelly_425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>combjelly_425.jpg</name><display-name>combjelly_425.jpg</display-name><file-size>10628</file-size><width>425</width><height>284</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/combjelly_80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/combjelly_80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>combjelly_80.jpg</name><display-name>combjelly_80.jpg</display-name><file-size>4544</file-size><width>80</width><height>79</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Comb jellies, now proven to be the 'sibling group' to all other animals, can be found in the&#160;nearby Monterey Bay.

We&#8217;ve used genetics to travel back in time about one billion years to get the strongest evidence yet to answer a fundamental question about the earliest events in animal evolution,&#8221; said Darrin Schultz, first author on the paper and who led the research as a UCSC graduate student. &#8220;This finding will lay the foundation for the scientific community to begin to develop a better understanding of how animals &#8212; and humans &#8212; have evolved.&#8221;<br/><br/>In the new study, a team of researchers from UC Santa Cruz, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), UC Berkeley, and the University of Vienna used new techniques to compare the genomes of comb jellies and sponges to find evidence about one of the earliest moments in animal evolution.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Researchers at MBARI, including Steve Haddock, an affiliate faculty in UCSC&#8217;s ocean sciences department, were able to collect DNA samples of these squishy sea creatures from the nearby Monterey Bay and sequence them. Richard (Ed) Green, UCSC professor of biomolecular engineering, and his lab led the genome assembly efforts, creating a complete and accurate picture of the entire length of each chromosome for two comb jellies and two marine sponges, as well as three single-celled close relatives of animals in order to create a more complete and organized picture of each one&#8217;s genes.&#160;<br/><br/>With the complete sequences in hand, the researchers looked for patterns of linked genes to help answer the question of whether sponges or ctenophores are the most distant relative of all other animals.<br/><br/>While groups of animals have evolved hundreds of millions of years apart, a remarkably large number of genes remain located on the same chromosomes across these vastly different animal groups. Over time, the order of the genes may change, but they remain located on the same chromosome, except in rare circumstances.&#160;<br/><br/>In the past, researchers have compared the order of genes on a chromosome to infer how closely related groups of organisms are to one another, with more similarities indicating that groups are more closely related. However, they found that this technique did not give reliable answers when looking this far back in animals&#8217; evolutionary history.&#160;<br/><br/>The complete genome sequences for the animals allowed the scientists to observe previously-unseen occurrences that happen at the chromosome level. Studying the evolutionary history of the chromosomes, which occurs on the time-scale of hundreds of millions of years, rather than just the genes within a chromosome, showed that chromosome evolution follows unique and unpredictable rules.<br/><br/>&#8220;When you look at the changes that happen in chromosome evolution, which happen much more slowly, it gives us hope that all of life&#8217;s history may be knowable, if we just look at the right thing in the right way,&#8221; Green said.<br/><br/>When they examined the chromosome-scale genome of comb jellies, they saw a grouping of genes that was very different from the patterns in other animals. Most importantly, they found patterns of genes that were shared between the comb jellies and three non-animals, whereas those patterns of genes have been shuffled and mixed in all other animals. This provided clear evidence that the comb jellies split off first, before all other animals.<br/><br/>&#8220;That was the smoking gun &#8212; we found a handful of rearrangements shared by sponges and<br/>non-ctenophore animals,&#8221; said Daniel Rokhsar, a co-author on the study and a professor at UC Berkeley. &#8220;In contrast, ctenophores resembled the non-animals. The simplest explanation is that ctenophores branched off before the rearrangements occurred.&#8221;<br/><br/>Resolving this long-standing question will help shed light on how anatomical systems formed in the earliest animals and how they evolved into the advanced digestive tracts, muscles, and nervous systems in other animals. It can also help scientists better understand how single-cell organisms evolved into multicellular life.<br/><br/>&#8220;Getting this right lets us better understand how the very complex life that we have now came to be,&#8221; Green said. &#8220;It also lets us go backwards in time and understand how the transition from single-cell to multicellular life worked in better detail. This is one of the deepest mysteries that exists.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Funding for this research was provided by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, MBARI, the National Science Foundation (GRFP DGE 1339067 and DEB-1542679), the European Research Council&#8217;s Horizon 2020: European Union Research and Innovation Programme (grant No. 945026), internal funds of the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Molecular Genetics Unit, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Network, and the Marthella Foskett Brown Chair in Biological Sciences.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2b697695807270465bc2f86a7592c847"><name>blum-center-habitat</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Empowering communities through partnership </title><summary>In partnership with Habitat for Humanity Monterey Bay, UC Santa Cruz’s Blum Center is working to compile data and stories on the impact of affordable housing in Santa Cruz. &#13;

</article-subhead><article-text><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project was made possible by a grant to UC Santa Cruz from the Monterey Peninsula Foundation and the Blum Center's generous donors.&#160;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to provide relief to low-income families in Santa Cruz&#8212;a county at the center of rising housing costs&#8212;Habitat for Humanity is in the process of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">completing almost a dozen new homes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Rodeo Creek Court&#8212;Habitat&#8217;s eleven-home development in the Live Oak neighborhood of Santa Cruz&#8212;six families have already moved in. Habitat is working to complete the remaining five homes by June 2024.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 6, five UCSC undergraduates, one graduate student, and two faculty members working with The Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise, and Participatory Governance spent their Saturday volunteering at the build </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">site, highlighting one of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiential learning opportunities UCSC students</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are gaining from a partnership with Habitat for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These new affordable housing units&#8212;built on property donated by Santa Cruz County&#8212;will provide a safe haven for a diverse group of individuals, including teachers, a Navy veteran, two families displaced by the CZU fires, five single parents, and children.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these families settle into their new homes, they will soon have a place to call their own&#8212;a safe haven where they can grow, thrive, and make memories that will last a lifetime. Among the duplexes they are building, there are eight three-bedroom homes and two two-bedroom homes, as well as a stand-alone ADA compliant three-bedroom home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is only one project of many that Habitat for Humanity has spearheaded in an effort to expand&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">affordable housing in Santa Cruz County. Now in partnership with UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Blum Center, Habitat will soon be able to quantify and showcase the full impact of their work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Habitat for Humanity Monterey Bay knows that they're making an impact on people's lives,&#8221; said Blum Center Program Manager Lisa Nishioka. &#8220;One can imagine all of the beneficial effects gaining affordable housing might have across the lifespan of a family and on future generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re excited to understand and document those short&#8212;and long&#8212;term impacts and to be able to advocate for their program&#8212;both to donors and to elected officials&#8212;about the importance of supporting Habitat in their endeavors.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleven undergraduate research interns with UCSC&#8217;s Blum Center have spent the past year interviewing Habitat homeowners and assessing the impact of affordable housing on multi-generational economic security, civic engagement, well-being, and opportunity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blum Center&#8217;s project goals include documenting and assessing program impacts to further enhance capacity, educating UCSC students about affordable housing and fostering community-engaged research skills, and raising awareness in the community and among policymakers of the importance and benefits of affordable housing.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmy Boe (Oakes &#8217;24, community studies), an undergraduate researcher with The Blum Center, said interviewing homeowners and gaining hands-on experience was eye-opening.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We learn a lot at UCSC from our professors in an academic sense,&#8221; Boe said, &#8220;but being involved in community-based organizations and research, we learned so much embodied knowledge from the people who live in the community that you wouldn't get at the university.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 60 percent of renters in Santa Cruz County spend 30 percent or more of their household income on rent. Habitat for Humanity hopes to alleviate the housing burden for low-income families through affordable home-ownership opportunities.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyndsey Marks, Director of Resource Development for Habitat for Humanity Monterey Bay, shared their policy and program model which ensures that Habitat homeowners never pay more than 30 percent of their combined monthly income.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are creating stability for people,&#8221; Marks said. &#8220;We believe that, for the community as a whole, it really benefits to have people who can build strong roots in Santa Cruz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Habitat building sites are spearheaded by Construction Managers Dylan Childs and Keaton Port-Gaarn, and Construction Associate Sal Dibiasi. In addition, the construction crew relies on a dedicated team of volunteers, coordinated by Volunteer and Event Manager, Allie Wilson. The volunteer crew includes Habitat homeowners, who must put in 500 hours of sweat equity in order to attain their home.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC student Rosalie Lansing (Rachel Carson &#8217;24, sociology and linguistics) volunteered at the Live Oak build site on May 6.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Doing this project [with the Blum Center] gave me more tools to advocate for affordable housing, which is something I want to do in the future,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Getting to do the analysis of all of the data we've collected and being able to see which impacts are most prominent, makes me excited to be able to do more work with this topic and be able to advocate for affordable housing and resources.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blum Center is excited to share its findings with Habitat for Humanity Monterey Bay later this summer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need to be able to share why this matters for people,&#8221; Marks said. &#8220;Some of the Blum Center students shared that they had experienced housing insecurity growing up, and they could relate to some of the stories they were hearing. I am really inspired by their commitment and their passion for our work.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

This prestigious award will support Miga&#8217;s research on constitutive heterochromatin, regions of the genome that have been previously unexplored due to their complexity.&#160;<br/><br/>Miga aims to create the first-ever maps of these regions using the genomes of people from a diverse range of populations. This will give insight into how these regions are regulated and inherited, and how they may contribute to disease.<br/><br/>&#8220;This is a real honor to be recognized as a Searle Scholar,&#8221; Miga said. &#8220;For so long these repeat-rich regions of our genome have been ignored. It is exciting to think about the new discoveries we will make about the genome structure and function of satellite DNAs over the next three years with this support.&#8221; &#8232;<br/>Constitutive heterochromatin are regions of DNA recognized to be crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity and ensuring chromosomes separate properly when the cell divides. These regions are known to be transcriptionally silent, meaning the genes are &#8220;turned off.&#8221;&#160;<br/><br/>Constitutive heterochromatin regions are highly repetitive and densely packed, and have been historically difficult to clone, sequence, and assemble correctly. Because of this, these regions have represented the largest, most persistent gaps across all genome reference assemblies.<br/><br/>However, with recently improved DNA sequencing and assembling methods that make it possible to create <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/t2t-genome.html">complete, telomere-to-telomere</a> genome sequences &#8212; methods pioneered by Miga and others &#8212; it is now possible to return to these regions to better understand the complex biological mechanisms that lock them in a &#8220;turned off&#8221; state. Miga will create the first high-resolution maps of these areas and study how they are inherited by observing them in genomes from a three-generation family line.&#160;<br/><br/>This work builds on <a href="https://magazine.ucsc.edu/2022/08/opening-the-black-box/">Miga&#8217;s expertise</a> on the function of long stretches of repetitive DNA sequences, which have been previously regarded by scientists as &#8220;junk DNA.&#8221; Her interest in these complex regions brought her to the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute, which has been pioneering work in genomic sequencing and assembly for years. Since joining UCSC as a postdoc and now a faculty member, Miga has been a leader on groundbreaking human genomics projects including the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium&#8217;s first truly complete sequence of a human genome and the Human Pangenome Research Consortium&#8217;s <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/05/pangenome-draft.html">first draft of a human pangenome reference</a> to increase equity in genetic research.<br/><br/>The Searle Scholar Program supports the independent research of exceptional young faculty in the biomedical sciences and chemistry. Each scholar receives an award of $300,000 in flexible funding for their research over three years.&#160;<br/>This year, 15 scholars were chosen from 175 applications.

When students have stable and reliable access to food and housing, they are better able to focus on their studies, connect with their peers and professors, participate in extracurricular activities, and fully engage with all aspects of their UC Santa Cruz experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a University of California survey, 43 percent of undergraduates systemwide report having limited or uncertain access to food. California&#8217;s housing crisis has left 8 percent of UC undergraduates without stable places to live. Closer to home, nearly 9,000 current UC Santa Cruz students have been food or housing insecure at some point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of California system is committed to reducing food and housing insecurity by 50 percent in 2025. UC Santa Cruz is taking an integrated approach to knocking down the obstacles that stand in students&#8217; paths as they navigate their educational journey. The university has created a network of strategic, cross-divisional efforts to connect students with the resources they need, when and where they need them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are doing all we can to ensure that the basic needs of our students are met. Only then can they fully focus on their studies and take advantage of the many personal and academic opportunities that we make available to them,&#8221; says UCSC Chancellor Cynthia Larive.</span></p>
<h3><strong>A coordinated approach</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university&#8217;s multi-pronged approach&#8212;including field-to-plate food security, expanded access and food pantry resources, holistic CalFresh support, student-centered basic needs research and assessment, and Slug Support program&#8212;works to ensure a safety net for UCSC students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve identified key campus areas and developed benchmarks to ensure that we are increasing our ability to support students&#8217; basic needs. Our efforts at UCSC can serve to inspire our colleagues and partners across the University of California and beyond,&#8221; says Tim Galarneau, education and research specialist at the Center for Agroecology and Co-Chair of the UC-wide Basic Needs Initiative.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative will support five areas on campus:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Field to Plate Food Security</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the UCSC campus, students engage in field and kitchen internships, and plant, harvest, and access free, organic, farm-fresh produce at a variety of basic needs distribution sites, including a twice-a-week pop-up market, and non-transactional cafe space. The Foodways Fund supports this work through student positions, ingredient sourcing, equipment innovation, and ensuring the Center for Agroecology cultivates a sustainable and equity-driven vision for nourishing food-insecure students and their dependents from the field to the produce bag and prepared plate across campus sites.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Expanding Access and Pantry Resources</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Redwood Market&#8212;a non-transactional market space to support students&#8212;sources fresh and prepared food items as well as supplemental hygiene, baby products, and other essentials to support student success. The Dean of Students provides pantry guidance and support to campus programs and partners with our Student Union Assembly on their direct student-to-student food distributions to provide meal swipes for access to dining halls for non-meal plan holders. The fund will ensure continued access to this important set of campus resources.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Holistic CalFresh Support&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC provides support for student CalFresh enrollment and renewal as well as supplemental aid for non-eligible food insecure student populations, including undocumented students, underground scholars, and international students. CalFresh and our CalFresh equivalent food support programs ensure impacted students can receive supplemental resources in assistance to ensure their food security and access to fresh and prepared food.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Slug Support Program</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Support ensures that every student has access to the resources they need, when and where they need them. UCSC&#8217;s Slug Support program identifies students who are navigating difficult or challenging situations and helps them resolve their concerns. Taking a holistic, student-centered approach and working as an interdisciplinary team in partnership with other campus programs, Slug Support helps students focus on their time at UC Santa Cruz and reduces barriers to graduation.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Student Centered Basic Needs Research and Assessment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on the foundational work of the UCSC Blum Center,&#160; the basic needs team engages undergraduate and graduate applied research and scholarship to advance food and housing security efforts at UCSC. Resources from the Foodways Fund will provide experiential learning opportunities by funding undergraduate and graduate student positions as well as publication and education materials to inform improving our practices and advancing our basic needs support and student success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Addressing food security is essential to cultivating our students&#8217; success,&#8221; said Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Akirah Bradley-Armstrong. &#8220;Focusing on these five areas will increase access to necessary nourishment and promote students&#8217; health and well-being. Doing this is critical to improving students&#8217; overall educational experience and learning potential.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Expanding resources</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UCSC Foundation Board of Trustees committed resources to support the development of the roadmap to student food security and is co-hosting this year&#8217;s Foodways Dinner, an important fundraising event for these efforts. Scheduled for Friday, June 2 at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s historic Cowell Hay Barn, the event will raise necessary resources to further advance student food and basic needs security over the next two years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Board of Trustees cares deeply about student success,&#8221; says UCSC Foundation Chair Richard Moss (Stevenson &#8217;85). &#8220;We are inspired to promote food security at UC Santa Cruz, knowing that our efforts will help ensure students&#8217; academic success as well as contribute to their overall well-being and future accomplishments.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gifts George and his </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wife Rafe, a Santa Cruz mom, have made to UCSC&#8212;which include the Kraw Lecture Series, the East Field lights, and many more&#8212;have positively impacted the experiences of students, faculty, and alumni.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whatever success I&#8217;ve had in life started with UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel a responsibility to help support the university, especially since I went to college at a time when it cost hardly anything to go to a UC. I really feel obliged to give back to UCSC for all the help it&#8217;s given me.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Attending and graduating UCSC&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Berkeley, Kraw decided to stay local when choosing colleges. He chose UCSC because of its small class sizes and the unique collaboration between faculty and students.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UC Santa Cruz was just the right place for me,&#8221; Kraw said. &#8220;I knew it would be a place for quiet contemplation of interesting ideas, and that&#8217;s what I was looking for.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw said he got plenty of close attention from professors as a student. So when he decided to create an independent study in Russian art history, Jasper Rose, a founding faculty member of UCSC and second-ever Cowell College Provost, happily mentored Kraw.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the first sports club on campus was formed, Kraw began playing rugby&#8212;coached by physics professors Dave Dorfan and Ron Ruby. Kraw typically played in the &#8220;lock&#8221; and &#8220;breakaway&#8221; positions and was on the first team ever formed. He says rugby was integral to his time at UCSC and is still heavily connected to the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/04/mens-rugby-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;who just finished their historic first-ever season in D1A. In 2017, Kraw donated the stadium lights to the East Field to support UCSC&#8217;s rugby teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A world-class university deserves a world-class rugby team,&#8221; Kraw says with a smile &#8220;It&#8217;s just been wonderful to see the growth of UCSC rugby over the years.&#8221; .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw graduated from UCSC in 1971 with a B.A. in history and Russian studies. He then pursued his M.A. in history and J.D. in law from UC Berkeley. While in law school, Kraw was determined to become his own person, and after working and leaving two post-graduation jobs, he opened a law firm specializing in corporate finance and litigation for start-up companies, before later focusing on financial issues for Taft-Hartley employee benefit plans.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love doing the type of work that I do,&#8221; Kraw said. &#8220;At its most fundamental level, I chiefly represent union pension and health and welfare funds. I also work with apprenticeship and vacation funds. These funds are the core of&#160; a number of unionized industries.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw currently practices in the same firm as his wife Rafe, who has her own long-standing practice with Taft-Hartley funds and labor organizations.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Gifts making an impact</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw&#8217;s reach can be felt across campus through his gifts to various programs and organizations.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George and Rafe Kraw established the Kraw Lecture Series in 2017 to amplify scientific truth-telling and showcase underappreciated scientific research at UCSC. During a tense and demoralizing period for science, the Kraw Lectures were an impassioned defense for scientific inquiry in a series that prided itself on open access to the results of scientific inquiry. During the pandemic, the lectures moved to a virtual format, enabling many hundreds of people to participate virtually and in-person over nearly 6 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kraw talks are always free and open to the public and cover topics ranging from astrophysics and planetary discovery and the extraordinary advances of the UCSC genomic browser to the Antarctic in a time of climate change and the possibility of self-driving cars creating massive future gridlock.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lecture in the Kraw Series featured Daniel Kim&#160; discussing how latest developments in RNA "liquid biopsy" technology will help advance the future of precision health for everyone.&#160; &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Clear and open communication about science and technology is critically important,&#8221; Kraw said in a </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/05/kraw-lecture-dw-feature.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;I have been interested in the pernicious effects of political ideology and zealotry on science since my undergraduate days at Cowell College.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of his many gifts to UCSC, Kraw says that his most treasured gift is the gift to faculty-led labs offering course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental (MCD) Biology.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principal investigator Jeremy Sanford, professor of MCD biology, and co-principal investigator and teaching professor in MCD biology, Guido Bordignon, head the CURE labs. In addition to Kraw&#8217;s gift, the project received a grant from the National Science Foundation in 2022 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically geared towards improving undergraduate education at Hispanic Serving Institutions. They&#8217;ve used the funds to implement an expansion of CURE labs and study their impact on student success.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw says that his gift to the CURE lab is one of his favorites because of its direct impact on student research and education.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The students, rather than just doing lab coursework, are working in research labs,&#8221; Kraw said. &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased about my gift because it led to larger gifts being given to this program, and it&#8217;s gotten much more recognition since.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanford&#8211;the principal lead of CURE lab and Rugby Head Coach&#8212; says that George and Rafe Kraw&#8217;s gift to the CURE Lab set a course for amplifying undergraduate research opportunities at UCSC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The gift from George and Rafe gave me the opportunity to equip a laboratory space specifically for CUREs students and launch a large-scale undergraduate research project,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;Starting in Fall of 2017, I was able to experiment with different approaches for the lab and develop an optimal framework for the student experience. Over the next five years I worked with over 120 undergrad students on the Toxic RNA project. Without a CUREs lab that number would have been closer to 6.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MCD Biology is one of the most sought after majors at UCSC. Each year the department graduates about 550 students with degrees aligned with MCD Biology. The department&#8217;s students are nearly 50 percent first generation college students and nearly 40 percent are from historically underrepresented groups. The growth and expansion of CURE labs at UCSC have given students hands-on experience in undergraduate research they will carry with them for the rest of their careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Without George and Rafe, we would not have been able to begin this project,&#8221; Sanford added. &#8220;They&#8217;ve had a huge impact on the lives and careers of our life science students."</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraw is hopeful that sharing his reasons for making gifts to UC Santa Cruz will encourage others to do the same.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As alumni we&#8212;if we have the means to do so&#8212;have the potential to make a transformative difference for current students at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Kraw said. &#8220;There are opportunities all over the place at UCSC, whether in the sciences or arts, there&#8217;s so much talent we can support.&#8221;&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="363f39cc807270464408c1f50ce3e560"><name>campus-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Campus update: Quarter winding down, commencement plans in place, enroll in Summer Session now</title><start-date>1684393200000</start-date><display-name>Spring 2023 campus update</display-name><path>/2023/05/campus-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/campus-update</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1684537293235</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1684537328662</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dear Campus Community,</p>

<h2>The Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Commencement plans in place</li>
<li>Something for everyone at Summer Session</li>
<li>May is AAPI Heritage, Jewish American Heritage, Mental Health Awareness Month</li>
<li>Input sought on Leading the Change, the UC Santa Cruz Strategic Academic Plan</li>
</ul>
<h2>Looking forward to commencement</h2>
<p>Commencement is an exciting time at UC Santa Cruz. Family, friends, and the campus community are able to come together during Slug Crossing to celebrate the Class of 2023. Set for Thursday through Sunday, June 15-18, on the Upper East Field, Slug Crossing will also be live-streamed for those unable to join in person. Other virtual components of the celebration will be available on the&#160;<a href="https://commencement.ucsc.edu">Commencement 2023 website</a>&#160;starting at 5 p.m. that Thursday.</p>
<p>I know many faculty and staff enjoy volunteering at commencement. Helping students and their guests have the best experience possible is a wonderful feeling. If you&#8217;d like to get involved, there is an&#160;<a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0e4fa4a62ba1f8c07-2023#/">online sign-up form</a>&#160;that lists available volunteer opportunities. Thank you so much for your help.</p>
<h2>Enroll in Summer Session</h2>
<p>While summer is often a time for internships, jobs and vacations, it&#8217;s also a fantastic opportunity for students to make progress toward their educational goals. Our new&#160;<a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/04/summer-session-program.html">Pay For Only 10 program</a>&#160;helps students take advantage of educational benefits that can be had through summer session. This summer, all current and incoming UCSC and UC undergraduates will only pay for up to 10 credits of summer tuition, even if taking more than 10 credits. This means our students can make degree progress this summer at reduced cost. An array of online and in-person courses are available to complete major and general education requirements. Please visit the&#160;<a href="https://summer.ucsc.edu/index.html">Summer Session website</a>&#160;for details. Also, remember that Summer Session classes are open to everyone, so faculty, staff, alumni, community members and even eligible high school students can learn about a host of topics from our stellar instructors!</p>
<h2>Celebrating May heritage and awareness months</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz strives to be a place where every student can see themselves and be themselves, where the diversity of our students is celebrated each day. Our communities are made better by embracing and celebrating the differences that define us. With that in mind, I&#8217;d like to recognize some of the heritage and awareness months that take place in May.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month</strong> is an opportunity to highlight the history, culture and contributions of generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched our community. At UCSC, our Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center (AA/PIRC) is a leader in efforts to co-create engagement with students who identify as part of the Asian American, Pacific Islander, South Asian, Southwest Asian and North African diasporas on our campus. The AAPI Faculty and Staff Group meets regularly and recently launched a newsletter to elevate the collective voice of the community and to recognize and share the accomplishments of its members. UC Santa Cruz holds the distinction of being one of only two members of the Association of American Universities designated both as an Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI), highlighting our commitment to equitable educational access and research excellence. A new endowed professorship for the UC Santa Cruz Center for South Asian Studies will advance the center as a thriving hub for faculty, students, and visiting scholars.</li>
<li><strong>Jewish American Heritage Month</strong> marks the contributions of generations of Jewish Americans to our community, state, and nation. California is home to a large and vibrant Jewish population that traces its roots to all corners of the globe. Our Jewish students, staff, faculty, and community members have helped shape UC Santa Cruz into the center for academic excellence it is today. Our Jewish students find community in a number of student organizations, among them the Jewish Student Union and the Leviathan Jewish Journal. Some of them also find community in external organizations such as Hillel and Chabad. Academically, Jewish Studies is an exciting interdisciplinary program that connects historical and contemporary expressions of Judaism with the arts, history, religion, world languages, and other areas. It is important for us to acknowledge that we, as a campus, have more to do in supporting our Jewish community members and speaking out against all forms of hate and injustice, including antisemitism. The recent high-profile incidents that took place on and off campus have prompted additional reflection about how we can support our Jewish students and all members of our community. Some of these ideas are just starting to come to fruition, and we will be sharing them at the appropriate times. In the meantime, it is important that we come together as a community to celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month with the joy it deserves.</li>
<li><strong>Mental Health Awareness Month</strong> encourages us to attend to our own mental health and to the mental health of those within our communities. The need to raise awareness about mental health has never been greater. Study after study has shown that our collective mental health has suffered in recent years, and college students are no exception. Even pre-COVID, college students reported deteriorating mental health and well-being, and this time of year is especially difficult, with end-of-quarter assignments and final exams right around the corner. The&#160;<a href="https://healthymindsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HMS_national_print-6-1.pdf">2021-2022 National Healthy Minds Study</a>&#160;revealed that nearly 23 percent of surveyed students indicated severe depression, 18 percent indicated severe anxiety, and 30 percent said they often felt isolated. These figures require our shared attention and response. A good starting place is to acknowledge the situation &#8212; Mental Health Awareness Month does that &#8212; and address the circumstances contributing to it. We encourage students and colleagues to participate in one of the&#160;<a href="https://shop.ucsc.edu/general-health-wellness/mental-health-awareness_month.html#pep-talk">many activities planned throughout May by Student Health Outreach and Promotion and by Counseling and Psychological Services</a>. Year-round,&#160;<a href="https://caps.ucsc.edu/">CAPS</a>&#160;provides assistance for students while the&#160;<a href="https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/">Employee Assistance Program</a>&#160;can provide counseling and support to faculty and staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>AAPI Heritage Month, Jewish American Heritage Month, and Mental Health Awareness Month are opportunities for us to commemorate and celebrate joyfully while repudiating efforts to divide us. As Banana Slugs, we stand together as a community that celebrates and upholds differences. There is so much at stake in ensuring that UC Santa Cruz continues to be a more diverse, welcoming, and inclusive climate for all.</p>
<h2>Another opportunity to weigh in on our strategic planning work</h2>
<p>As Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer and I announced earlier this month, we have reached a milestone in our campus community&#8217;s work on&#160;<a href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/">Leading the Change: the UC Santa Cruz Strategic Plan,</a>&#160;our effort to develop a shared vision for the campus future. After nearly a year of gathering feedback, the final Leading the Change committee draft reports and draft mission and vision statements are now available for review. Community feedback on these reports and statements is so valuable, and we are collecting it through Friday, June 30. Please weigh in to help craft the direction of our campus over the next decade! These collective insights will be reviewed and included as appropriate to finalize our work. Please visit the&#160;<a href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/strategic-plan/feedback.html">website</a>&#160;for more information.</p>

<p><span><strong>Celebrando mayo como mes de herencias y concientizaci&#243;n</strong></span></p>
<p><span>La UC Santa Cruz se esmera por ser un lugar donde cada estudiante puede verse a s&#237; mismo y ser &#233;l/ella mismo/a, donde la diversidad de nuestros estudiantes se celebra d&#237;a por d&#237;a. Nuestras comunidades se mejoran al abrazar y celebrar las diferencias que nos definen.

En la &#160;UCSC, nuestro Centro de Recursos Asi&#225;tico Americano/Isle&#241;o del Pac&#237;fico (AA/PIRC, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) es un l&#237;der en nuestros empe&#241;os por co-crear un compromiso con los estudiantes que se identifican como parte de las di&#225;sporas Asi&#225;tico Americana, Isle&#241;a del Pac&#237;fico, Sud Asi&#225;tica, Sudeste Asi&#225;tica y Norte Africanas en nuestro campus. El Grupo de la Facultad y Personal AAPI se re&#250;ne con regularidad y recientemente lanz&#243; un bolet&#237;n a fin de elevar la voz colectiva de la comunidad y de reconocer y compartir los logros de sus miembros. La UC Santa Cruz tiene la distinci&#243;n de ser uno de solo dos miembros de la Asociaci&#243;n de Universidades Americanas designados tanto como una Instituci&#243;n que Sirve a los Hispanos (HSI, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) como una Instituci&#243;n que Sirve a los Asi&#225;tico Americanos, Americanos Nativos e Isle&#241;os del Pac&#237;fico (AANAPISI, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s), destacando as&#237; nuestro compromiso con el acceso a una ense&#241;anza equitativa y a la excelencia investigativa.

California es hogar de una poblaci&#243;n jud&#237;a grande y vibrante con ra&#237;ces por todos los rincones del mundo. Nuestros estudiantes, personal, facultad, y miembros de la comunidad jud&#237;a han ayudado a formar la UC Santa Cruz como el centro de excelencia acad&#233;mica que es hoy d&#237;a. Nuestros estudiantes jud&#237;os hallan comunidad en numerosas organizaciones estudiantiles, entre ellas la Uni&#243;n Estudiantil Jud&#237;a y el Jornal Jud&#237;o Leviat&#225;n. Algunos de ellos hallan comunidad en organizaciones externas tales como Hillel y Chabad. Acad&#233;micamente, Estudios Jud&#237;os es un programa interdisciplinario emocionante que conecta expresiones hist&#243;ricas y contempor&#225;neas del juda&#237;smo con las artes, historia, religi&#243;n, lenguas del mundo y otras &#225;reas. Es importante para nosotros reconocer que, como campus, tenemos que hacer m&#225;s en apoyo a nuestros miembros de la comunidad jud&#237;os y expresarnos contra todas las formas de odio e injusticia, inclusive el antisemitismo. Los recientes incidentes de alto relieve que ocurrieron dentro y fuera del campus han propiciado una reflexi&#243;n adicional acerca de c&#243;mo podemos apoyar a nuestros estudiantes jud&#237;os y a todos los jud&#237;os miembros de nuestra comunidad. Algunas de estas ideas apenas ahora est&#225;n empezando a cristalizar, y estaremos comparti&#233;ndolas en el momento apropiado. Mientras tanto, es importante que sigamos unidos como comunidad para celebrar el Mes de Herencia Jud&#237;a Americana con la alegr&#237;a que este merece.</span></td>

Chavez was in Watsonville meeting with a group of nationwide union leaders, and her father was nominated by his peers to host Chavez for dinner.<br/> <br/>&#8220;Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta were household names,&#8221; said Marines, who is McHenry Library&#8217;s Arts &amp; Humanities librarian. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t realize the impact of their work until I was older&#8212;that being able to go to the dentist or doctor was a privilege of having a union contract.&#8221;<br/> <br/>When Marines learned that the Research Center for the Americas at UC Santa Cruz would be <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/10/dolores-huerta-research-center-naming-event.html">renamed the Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas (Huerta Center)</a>, she knew instantly that she wanted to support the fundraising efforts. Marines is proud to be among the first donors to make a significant gift to the Huerta Center.<br/>
<h3>Center focused on socio-political issues in the Americas</h3>
&#8220;UCSC, as a Hispanic-Serving Institution, has ramped up its marketing of services and resources available to students in the Chicano and Latino communities,&#8221; Marines said. &#8220;Resources like the Huerta Center have the potential to show them that they belong, that they are seen.&#8221;<br/> <br/>&#8220;The fact that UCSC named the center in honor of a leader who is the salt of the earth, who used her voice to make a huge difference in the lives of workers and the vulnerable&#8212;that is what heartens me and moved me to make a gift. I hope it inspires students to make an impact in their own communities.&#8221;<br/><br/>Established in 1992 as the Research Center for the Americas, <a href="https://huerta.ucsc.edu/">the Huerta Center</a> was the first research center in the University of California system to bring together scholars in Latinx, Latin American, human rights, and migration studies. The center&#8217;s programming and research address ongoing humanitarian, environmental and socio-political issues throughout the Americas. Marines gift will help amplify this work.<br/><br/>Huerta, a former UC Regent, has dedicated her life to advocating for social justice for underrepresented communities, particularly farmworkers. Among her many accomplishments, as co-founder (with Chavez) of the National Farmworkers Association, now the United Farm Workers, she advocated for safer working conditions, benefits, and pensions for farmworkers. <br/>
<h3>&#8220;Die-hard&#8221;</h3>
Marines witnessed that same dedication and deep compassion in her father, who, on a local level in Watsonville, became an approachable community resource. He was known for helping to organize labor unions and passing along skills he learned from Chavez and Huerta, including how to read contracts and understand their implications.<br/> <br/>&#8220;My father cared about his community and spent his life helping people. Because he was an American citizen and could speak English, if lost his job because he spoke up, he was confident he could get another one. Others did not have that luxury.&#8221; said Marines. &#8220;I brought my father to the screening of <a href="https://www.doloresthemovie.com/">the documentary film on Dolores&#8217; life</a>&#160;(DOLORES, 2017, director: Peter Bratt, Cowell &#8217;86, politics) to show him the way the movement he was part of was being honored and celebrated. Dolores pointed to my father and said, &#8216;de hueso colorado,&#8217; which translates to &#8216;die-hard.&#8217;&#8221;<br/>
<h3>&#8220;A beautiful moment&#8221;</h3>
&#8220;When I found out that Annette had made the gift, I got emotional,&#8221; said Sylvanna Falc&#243;n, director of the Huerta Center and associate professor of Latin American and Latino Studies, who has been a friend and colleague of Marines for years. &#8220;This was a full-circle, generous gift inspired because we renamed the center after one of her heroes. It is a tribute to her father and her own life story. It was a beautiful moment.&#8221;<br/> <br/>&#8220;As a librarian, Annette understands the value of having a research center that does work on social issues that matter to people,&#8221; said Falc&#243;n. &#8220;This gift helps ensure that students have support and resources to graduate and become changemakers in the world, like Dolores.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/10/dolores-huerta-research-center-naming-event.html</url><title>Dedication of the Huerta Center</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://huerta.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Dolores Huerta Research Center for the Americas</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="45b1238e8072704641ae00946b78a724"><name>kolbert-quarry-klein-feature-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Pulitzer Prize-winning climate journalist Elizabeth Kolbert warns of the complications, perils, and potentials of environmental interventions at Deep Read talk on campus</title><summary>In her on on-stage discussion with New York Times columnist, podcaster and UCSC alumna Ezra Klein, Elizabeth Kolbert spoke about the efforts to roll back the effects of climate change.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, Kolbert&#8217;s talk, the culminating event of this year&#8217;s fourth annual </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/deepread/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Read initiative &#8211; an annual program of The Humanities Institute at UCSC -</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> served as a strong and sobering corrective to anyone who over-promised about remedies ranging from &#8220;electrified rivers&#8221; to the use of invasive creatures such as cane toads and Asian carp to solve environmental crises without the use of pesticides that harm wildlife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of providing empty platitudes, Kolbert, author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under A White Sky: The Nature Of The Future</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, encouraged the crowd at the Quarry Amphitheater to work for solutions with a combination of wisdom and humility while&#160; considering the unintended consequences of even the most well-intentioned efforts to address climate change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under A White Sky</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in Kolbert&#8217;s words, is &#8220;about people trying to solve problems created by people trying to solve problems.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the book hinges on the stories of scientists who believe they have no choice but meddle in nature to reverse the unforeseen consequences of previous meddling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The trouble is that this counter-meddling, no matter how complex, far-ranging and expensive, can create even more problems that demand more remedies, creating an endless cycle of accidental harm and harm abatement.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, as Kolbert states in her book, many of the people she interviews also believe that doing nothing can also have a devastating impact.&#160; Many of the scientists in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under A White Sky </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe the world has been altered to the point where humans have no choice but try to manage the catastrophe they&#8217;ve created.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book gets its title from an emerging technology called solar geoengineering, a highly controversial proposed method of cooling the planet and reflecting the sun&#8217;s rays by seeding sulfate particles into the stratosphere, a method that could turn the skies from blue to white in the process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kolbert and Klein also discussed the delicate issue of stakeholder engagement in regard to the use of solar geoengineering. Who should be included in conversations regarding the wisdom of using it? This is an issue that </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/09/jinnah-harvard-advisory-committee.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC associate professor of environmental studies Sikina Jinna, an environmental governance expert, has studied in detail,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while calling for a &#8220;broad and inclusive process&#8221; for planetary decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under A White Sky</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8217;s most memorable passages comes from Andy Parker, project director of the Solar Radiation Management Initiative, who says, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world, where deliberately dimming the (expletive) sun might be less risky than not doing it.&#8221;&#160; Klein told Kolbert that &#8220;this is one of my favorite quotes of all time.&#8221; Whether or not the audience agreed that solar geoengineering is a good idea, Parker&#8217;s quote speaks to the hubris and foolishness of the human race and the mess it is in, Klein said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At times the book is darkly comic in the way it delves into strange and counterintuitive solutions to climate catastrophe.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the book is also full of stories about people who are passionate about their work and sincere in their efforts to solve intractable problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>Considering the fate of coral reefs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kolbert said the writing and research of this book began when she went to Hawaii and spoke with marine biologist Ruth Gates, widely recognized for her research into increasing the resilience of coral reefs. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gates, who died suddenly in 2018, focused on developing &#8220;super corals&#8221; that could resist bleaching and other environmental impacts.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Her words set me on this whole journey, and I often think about them,&#8221; Kolbert said. &#8220;At the time, super corals were very controversial &#8211; this idea that we screwed up the ocean so much that we have to intervene if we want reefs. A lot of people said, you weren&#8217;t getting reefs back if you had to manipulate them. Reefs are just huge. They are whole ecosystems. But her point was, we don&#8217;t have any choice, we are in this too far. I don&#8217;t know if she had the answer but she asked an important question.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klein asked Kolbert about humanity&#8217;s tendency to categorize itself apart from nature at a time when the boundaries between &#8216;natural&#8217; and human processes and impacts are blurred. In response, Kolbert said that human beings diverged from the rest of the natural realm when it began to use technologies that could change entire landscapes, including weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even in ancient times, peoples hunted animals to extinction, Kolbert said. Humans are also prime drivers of &#8216;speciation,&#8217; the practice of moving species all across the earth, including rats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also talked about the complications of solutions that may seem natural but have enormous consequences of their own. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if we can get out of that cycle,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Think of all the mining we have to do for electric cars, all the rare-earth minerals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>The Deep Read: forming a community of readers</strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under A White Sky</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the first-ever creative nonfiction selection in UCSC&#8217;s Deep Read program. The selection of this bestselling book led to an outpouring of interest. More than 1,200 people registered in advance for this year's Quarry Amphitheater talk, the highest number for any Deep Read keynote talk in the event&#8217;s four-year history.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deep Read activities included regular weekly emails that unpacked different aspects of the book with the guidance of visiting associate professor of journalism Jody Biehl, professor of environmental studies Sikina Jinnah, professor of marine sciences Mike Beck, who directs the new Center For Coastal Climate Resilience, and assistant professor of environmental art Jorgge Menna Barreto.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were online forums to ask questions and connect with fellow Deep Readers, and a salon in which participating professors led discussions with UCSC students and other members of the Deep Read community joining either virtually or in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selection of the book led to discussions about deep ecology, responsibility to future generations, and stewardship of the planet, as well as the role of&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the humanities in addressing humankind&#8217;s most pressing problems including climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Kolbert&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a White Sky</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> makes clear, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we will need more than scientific and technological solutionism to tackle climate change and build a just future,&#8221; UCSC Dean of the Humanities Jasmine Alinder said. &#8220;We also need contributions from the humanities and the arts, which are essential to any such future, or really any future at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Deeply complex, seemingly intractable problems need interdisciplinary, innovative approaches,&#8221; Alinder said. &#8220;There are ideas that can only be conceived of and conveyed through the humanities - questions, debates, and conversations about what it means to be human, to be alive, to work to transform society for the better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Engaging the audience</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deep Read is a public-facing event, giving the community a chance to delve deeply into books and engage the authors directly during the culminating live presentation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last weekend, the amphitheater full of Deep Readers lived up to their name, asking questions that showed their deep engagement with the text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They pressed Kolbert and Klein about the role of capitalism in creating and worsening the climate crisis, and the importance of turning to indigenous peoples for climate solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One audience member mentioned the carbon imprint that Kolbert and Klein had made just by flying to California for their Deep Read presentation. Kolbert and Klein both acknowledged that this was a conundrum.&#160;</span>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if she had any reason for hopefulness about the climate future, Kolbert made a cautious, measured </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">observation that left at least some room for optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess I do believe, at the end of the day, as a humanities major, that we are capable of thinking things through, that there is a capacity of knowledge, and the more we can imagine different ways of living, the better off we&#8217;ll be,&#8221; she said. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Humans are unbelievably multifaceted, and maybe that is the most hopeful thing I can say,&#8221; Kolbert told Klein. &#8220;Humans are capable of intense love, intense self-sacrifice, intense greed, and intense destruction. All of these are true simultaneously. Every single day, we are making choices about which of these elements will prevail. That&#8217;s what makes my job interesting. That&#8217;s what makes life interesting. And that&#8217;s what makes it beautiful and terrifying.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

Participating in a national Department of Transportation center is a great opportunity and a recognition of the talent and research done at UCSC.&#8221;<br/><br/>Gilpin is an expert in AI and explainability and will lead efforts so autonomous systems can justify their decisions to human operators. Fremont is an expert in formal methods and verification and will work on formalizing security properties and developing tests to find vulnerabilities.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>Around 100&#160; UC Santa Cruz staff and faculty retire each year. </i><a href="https://rec.ucsc.edu/events/retiring-class-2023.html"><i>Please join us in celebrating </i></a><i>the next chapter of their lives. </i><i>If you or someone you know is retiring and would like to be included on the Welcome to Retirement page </i><i>information can be submitted to the Retiree &amp; Emeriti Center at rec@ucsc.edu.</i></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless UC Santa Cruz students benefited from Dan Tokar&#8217;s career at the university&#8212;some were fortunate to have Tokar as a supervisor, and the rest enjoyed meals at a dining hall where Tokar played a key role.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Tokar&#8217;s current position is Unit Manager, running the entire Porter/Kresge Dining Hall operations. He oversees a staff of six managers, 42 full-time staff members, and 120 student employees. After 16 years on campus, Tokar will retire on June 30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We serve about 2,200 guests daily,&#8221; says Tokar. &#8220;We also provide breakfast and lunch for the </span><a href="https://childcare.ucsc.edu/about/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EES (Early Education Services)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program at Family Student Housing.&#8221; &#8220;Each day we feed about 50 children ranging from 11 months to 12 years old,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">60-year-old Tokar first joined the staff of UCSC in 2007, as Senior Food Service Manager at Crown Dining Hall. After working at Crown for five years, he worked at College Nine (now John R. Lewis College) for nine years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokar finds his job fulfilling for many reasons. His favorite part is leading the management team and student supervisors, giving them the necessary resources to manage the large staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe the dining hall is a great communal and welcoming space for students to gather, socialize, study, and eat,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Also, I enjoy running a smooth operation with great-tasting food and a clean environment where our customers can be served </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to our standards of safety, efficiency, and friendly customer service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokar has been in the restaurant and hospitality business for 45 years&#8212;and is glad to have had the opportunity to work at UC Santa Cruz for more than a third of that time. &#8220;UCSC is a special place to work. Everyone&#8217;s contributions are valued, no matter how big or small. I love the diversity and inclusivity the University offers. I have learned so much from many different people on campus. For example, I can roll a pretty impressive pupusa!&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Mentoring students and involving the community</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his UCSC career, one of his main roles has been Student Program Manager. In this capacity, he has hired, trained, and worked with about 2,500 students and for most of them, it was their first job. This was the case with former student employee Anissa Truscott, who has high praise for Tokar. When she</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked for him at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was her very first job. &#8220;He was an understanding and empathetic manager, collaborator, and teacher,&#8221; says Truscott. &#8220;He helped guide so many students who were navigating the workplace for the first time.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I take the first steps of a person&#8217;s employment very seriously,&#8221; says Tokar. &#8220;I want to give them the training and tools to help them succeed in any job they may have after they graduate, whether it be in the hospitality field or in the field of their major.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Truscott (Crown &#8217;15, biology) works for UCSC as a Principal Budget Analyst, as a full-time career staff employee in University Relations.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokar has found supervising students extremely rewarding. He encouraged them to learn as much as possible about work/life balance, because once they graduate, life becomes more demanding. His advice: &#8220;Practice your organizational skills where you can balance work, studies, rest, and time out with your friends, in a way that everything can fit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer service was always an important part of students&#8217; training. &#8220;I wanted them to know that no matter where they worked after they graduated, this would come into play. They can be a doctor, a teacher, a chef, or an engineer, and they will have customers that need to be communicated with and respected.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the many accomplishments throughout his career, Tokar is most proud of launching the Student Supervisor Program. In 2008, he noticed that there were some very talented students whose roles consisted of food prep, cashier, serving, and dishes. He teamed up with Jennifer Garcia, who was Bilingual Coordinator at the time. They came up with an idea where student employees could be hired and trained as Dining Supervisors who would then train, schedule, and supervise student employees. One goal Tokar and Garcia had was for students to gain significant leadership and communication experience that would be useful, post-graduation skills&#8212;transferable to any number of fields or careers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The successful program is still going strong today with the guidance of Student Employee Program Coordinator Luis Moreno Espinosa. Each year, there are approximately 75 student supervisors working throughout the dining areas on campus, managing about 1,000 student employees.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, UCSC Dining received an &#8220;Employer of the Year&#8221; award for being a long</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">time employer of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individuals with developmental disabilities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crown Dining </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall used to employ people from nonprofit Hope Services, which provides job training and other services. At the time of this award, Tokar was the hall&#8217;s service manager, regularly working with Hope Services clients. He got to accept the award on behalf of UCSC.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They helped in many areas and had an incredible work ethic. Even with the adversities they had encountered in life, they always had a smile on their face and a great attitude at work. Working with Hope Services taught me to always keep my eyes open and have an open mind because you never know who you will draw inspiration from.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing that dining is an essential service is very rewarding for Tokar. &#8220;In the last 16 years, our dining team fed our students through pandemics, fires, floods, and strikes,&#8221; says Tokar. &#8220;Even through the biggest of obstacles, our team was able to come to work, prepare nutritious food, and serve our customers. I am very proud of this.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>On to retirement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many people Tokar is grateful for, who have shaped his career and inspired him. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am today without the support of my parents and family,&#8221; shares Tokar. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been very fortunate to have people that have inspired me in my UCSC career. These include managers Mirjam Kuusik, Jeanne Kallerup, and Jeff Wildenboer just to name a few, plus Student Supervisor Alejandro Zamora, and many other hard-working full-time staff members.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After retiring from UCSC, Tokar plans to stay and enjoy Santa Cruz. He looks forward to traveling, paddle boarding, wine tasting, riding his bike, hanging out with friends, and working in his garden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;UCSC really did instill in me the power of nature, and to use nature as a grounding tool, which has always been healing,&#8221;she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2015/08/rev-fall-15-alumni-profile-foo.html">longtime journalist</a> and radio producer released her first book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in February 2022, exploring her life up to 2018 and discovering more about her healing thereafter.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Jose native had a successful life on paper, with a dream job at the popular public radio program </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This American Life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a loving boyfriend &#8212; but she was also suffering from panic attacks nearly daily. In 2018, she was able to find an answer, and was diagnosed with complex- PTSD (C-PTSD), a condition that occurs when trauma happens continuously over the course of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that point forward, Foo aimed to learn more about how this diagnosis made sense of her past, and how she could heal to move into her future. For this book, she interviewed scientists, psychologists and others, while also trying various therapies; she further returned to the Bay Area, and discovered how her past trauma would continue to be a factor of her life &#8212; but there were ways to cope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I always knew that I wanted to be a journalist &#8212; that was a dream I had had since high school,&#8221; Foo shared, noting her written work for major magazines and newspapers and internships at that time.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While UC Santa Cruz did not have a formal journalism program, Foo majored in English and hustled as a freelance writer outside of class, ultimately graduating in just two-and-a-half years.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I lived with a bunch of incredible people who I still talk to on a regular basis today,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I got a very good basis in the humanities, and learned a lot about broken systems in America&#8230;as well as about drinking kombucha.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shortly thereafter moved from Santa Cruz up north, settling in both San Francisco and Oakland as she helped to create and became a founding producer for Glynn Washington&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snap Judgment</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> radio show. Foo was then offered a producer role for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This American Life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and made the transition to New York City, where she still lives today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transition from the Bay Area to New York was difficult for Foo, who &#8220;didn&#8217;t know where to ground [herself]&#8221; without easy accessibility to redwoods, hills and California&#8217;s weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through all of these changes and job updates, Foo learned and retooled her abilities to tell stories, and figure out ways in which to craft her narratives: &#8220;Learning how to tell a really compelling story, keep the listener engaged, interview people at their most vulnerable&#8230;it was a tremendous learning experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those skills helped to propel her forward when she received her C-PTSD diagnosis in 2018 and began to figure out those next steps.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I was diagnosed, a lot of my life made sense&#8230;it explained my anxiety and depression,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It really made me reevaluate everything in my life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a trained journalist, Foo wanted to examine her diagnosis from that perspective, reading as many articles and books about C-PTSD&#160; as possible. However, in her research, she found that most of the published works surrounding C-PTSD were pathologizing, and unhelpful, which gave her more space to determine if she could (and should) tell her own story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I needed to reevaluate all of what my worth is, if it wasn&#8217;t as a journalist &#8212; what is my narrative,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next year and a half, Foo dedicated herself to various therapies, connecting with scientists and researchers, and ultimately discovering others with C-PTSD. She began to feel hopeful, and felt well-enough resourced to start her healing journey as she also wrote her memoir.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the book&#8217;s release in February 2022 (Ballantine Books), Foo has continued in her healing journey &#8212; while also receiving dozens of messages daily from others who felt supported by her work.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It makes me feel a lot less lonely and a lot less freakish, which is how I felt originally,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It allows me to see that so many of us have this pain&#8230;it&#8217;s really great to have this community. I think that&#8217;s definitely one of the achievements of the book I am most proud of.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has also since <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ucsantacruz/ucsc-news-roundup-podcast-stephanie-foo-feb-26-2021">returned to Santa Cruz</a>, both in person and virtually, speaking to students from the Del Mar Theater in January 2020, and then as a commencement speaker for Stevenson College via Zoom. While it&#8217;s been a few years since she&#8217;s returned, she knows just how lucky she is to have this city, this college, to return to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I always have the excuse to go back to being a part of this immense beauty&#8230;it was grounding before I knew what being grounded was,&#8221; she said.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="587fea888072704664e5b68abaab98f6"><name>distinguished-teaching-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Associate Teaching Professor Alegra Eroy-Reveles receives Distinguished Teaching Award</title><summary>Alegra Eroy-Reveles, an associate teaching professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, was honored for the positive impact she has had on her students, colleagues, and department.</summary><start-date>1685430000000</start-date><display-name>Associate Teaching Professor Alegra Eroy-Reveles receives Distinguished Teaching Award</display-name><path>/2023/05/distinguished-teaching-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/distinguished-teaching-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1685111958133</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1685458236812</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/alegra-eroy-reveles-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/alegra-eroy-reveles-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alegra-eroy-reveles-300.jpg</name><display-name>alegra-eroy-reveles-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>48452</file-size><width>300</width><height>341</height></image><image-alt>Alegra Eroy-Reveles</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/alegra-eroy-reveles-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/alegra-eroy-reveles-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>alegra-eroy-reveles-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>alegra-eroy-reveles-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>15264</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Alegra Eroy-Reveles</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Alegra Eroy-Reveles</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The UCSC Committee on Teaching has awarded the 2022-23 Distinguished Teaching Award to Alegra Eroy-Reveles, an associate teaching professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. She was honored for the positive impact she has had on her students, colleagues, and department.</p>
<p>Glenn Millhauser, professor and chair of chemistry and biochemistry, said Eroy-Reveles has been a key player in the redesign of the introductory chemistry curriculum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alegra uniquely sensed the challenges brought by introductory chemistry and identified key pinch points that were causing student failure,&#8221; Millhauser wrote in nominating her for the award. &#8220;She developed novel active learning techniques, reevaluated the curriculum, and led efforts within the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department to develop fundamentally new approaches. Her concepts of how to slowly ramp up the needed mathematical components have played a major role in the full redesign of general chemistry and have also garnered considerable attention in other disciplines in the physical sciences, providing models for broader curricular reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eroy-Reveles worked with Millhauser to develop the new Chemistry Learning Center, which provides a vibrant, collegial space in the Physical Sciences Building for engaging students and fostering student success. She is also squarely focused on closing equity gaps in the physical sciences, Millhauser said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her strategies on curricular design and chemistry learning are sure to provide pathways to success for our underrepresented students,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Eroy-Reveles grew up in Watsonville and earned her Ph.D. in bioinorganic chemistry at UC Santa Cruz. After a postdoctoral fellowship at UCSF, she was an assistant professor at San Francisco State University before joining the UCSC faculty in 2018. She is currently working with colleagues at other UC campuses as a co-principal investigator of a project funded by the National Science Foundation with the goal of increasing the number of Latinx teaching-focused faculty in STEM.</p>
<p>&#8220;Notably, she&#8217;s earned outstanding teaching awards at both SFSU and UCSC,&#8221; Millhauser said. &#8220;She is truly a remarkable scholar and teacher who is exerting profound influence on promoting educational equity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The annual Distinguished Teaching Award recognizes outstanding teaching at UCSC and is open to all faculty, teaching professors, and Unit 18 lecturers. The award acknowledges pedagogical contributions that include but also go beyond any one course, and it seeks to recognize an instructor who has made significant contributions to educational equity within and beyond UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5a2e7ae28072704664e5b68a62904a8a"><name>weber-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Gerald E.

A year for WASP-18b (one orbit of its star) takes just 23 hours. There&#8217;s nothing like it in our solar system. In addition to observatories on the ground, NASA&#8217;s Hubble, Chandra, TESS, and Spitzer space telescopes have all been used to observe WASP-18b, an ultra-hot gas giant 10 times more massive than Jupiter.</p>
<p>Now astronomers have used NASA&#8217;s James Webb Space Telescope to identify water vapor in the atmosphere of WASP-18b and make a temperature map of the planet as it slipped behind, and reappeared from, its star. They reported their findings in a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06230-1">published May 31 in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike previous papers from our team, this one describes a secondary eclipse, which occurs when a planet disappears behind the host star,&#8221; said coauthor Natalie Batalha, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz who leads the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Early Release Science Team and helped coordinate the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;This type of observation allows us to study the thermal infrared radiation that the planet emits on the star-facing side,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The JWST observations have such high precision that we can also measure the minute variations occurring while the planet is slipping behind (and then emerging from) the limb of the star. This allows us to infer spatial information about the planetary atmosphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same side of WASP-18b always faces the star, just as the same side of the moon always faces Earth. The temperature, or brightness, map shows a huge change in temperature&#8212;up to 1,000 degrees&#8212;from the hottest point facing the star to the terminator, where day and night sides of the tidally-locked planet meet in permanent twilight.</p>
<p>&#8220;JWST is giving us the sensitivity to make much more detailed maps of hot giant planets like WASP-18b than ever before,&#8221; said coauthor Megan Mansfield, a Sagan Fellow at the University of Arizona. &#8220;This is the first time a planet has been mapped with JWST, and it&#8217;s really exciting to see that some of what our models predicted, such as a sharp drop in temperature away from the point on the planet directly facing the star, is actually seen in the data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team mapped temperature gradients across the day side of the planet. Given how much cooler the planet is at the terminator, there is likely something hindering winds from efficiently redistributing heat to the night side. But what is hindering the winds is still a mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brightness map of WASP-18b shows a lack of east-west winds that is best matched by models with atmospheric drag. One possible explanation is that this planet has a strong magnetic field, which would be an exciting discovery,&#8221; said coauthor Ryan Challener of the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>One interpretation of the eclipse map is that magnetic effects force the winds to blow from the planet&#8217;s equator up over the North pole and down over the South pole, instead of East-West, as scientists would otherwise expect.</p>
<p>Researchers recorded temperature changes at different elevations of the gas giant planet&#8217;s layers of atmosphere. They saw temperatures increase with elevation, varying by hundreds of degrees.</p>
<p>The spectrum clearly shows multiple small but precisely measured water features, present despite the extreme temperatures of almost 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,700 C). It&#8217;s so hot that it would tear most water molecules apart, so still seeing its presence speaks to Webb&#8217;s extraordinary sensitivity to detect remaining water that survived. The amounts recorded in WASP-18b&#8217;s atmosphere indicate water vapor at various elevations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a great feeling to look at WASP-18b&#8217;s JWST spectrum for the first time and see the subtle but precisely measured signature of water,&#8221; said Louis-Philippe Coulombe, a graduate student at the University of Montreal and lead author of the WASP-18b paper. &#8220;Using such measurements, we will be able to detect such molecules for a wide range of planets in the years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers looked at WASP-18 b for about six hours with one of Webb&#8217;s instruments, the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS), contributed by the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
<p>Proximity, both to its star and to us, helped make WASP-18 b an intriguing target for scientists, as did its large mass. WASP-18 b is one of the most massive worlds whose atmospheres we can investigate. Scientists want to know how such planets form and come to be where they are. This, too, has some early answers from Webb.</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8216;By analyzing WASP-18b&#8217;s spectrum, we not only learn about the various molecules that can be found in its atmosphere but also about the way it formed. We find from our observations that WASP-18b&#8217;s composition is very similar to that of its star, meaning it most likely formed from the leftover gas that was present just after the star was born,&#8217;&#8217; Coulombe said. &#8216;&#8216;Those results are very valuable to get a clear picture of how strange planets like WASP-18b, which have no counterpart in our solar system, come to exist.&#8217;&#8217;</p>
<p>More than 100 scientists around the globe are working on early science from Webb through the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program. In addition to Batalha, other UCSC scientists involved in this study include Xi Zhang, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences; Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics; and postdoctoral scholars Aarynn Carter and Kazumasa Ohno.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6da305e4807270461aafbc99a56b3f51"><name>new-vc-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Announcing our new Vice Chancellor for Research</title><summary>John MacMillan, who has served as interim Vice Chancellor for Research since July 2021, has accepted our offer to serve in the position on a permanent basis.</summary><start-date>1685430000000</start-date><display-name>Announcing our new Vice Chancellor for Research</display-name><path>/2023/05/new-vc-research</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/new-vc-research</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1685466580436</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1700180321438</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/vc-research.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/vc-research.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>vc-research.jpeg</name><display-name>vc-research.jpeg</display-name><file-size>55664</file-size><width>832</width><height>487</height></image><image-alt>New Vice Chancellor for Research, John MacMillan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2023/05/images/vc-research-thumb.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2023/05/images/vc-research-thumb.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>vc-research-thumb.jpeg</name><display-name>vc-research-thumb.jpeg</display-name><file-size>10274</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>New Vice Chancellor for Research, John MacMillan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>John MacMillan</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am excited to announce that John MacMillan, who has served as interim Vice Chancellor for Research since July 2021, has accepted our offer to serve in the position on a permanent basis, beginning Thursday, June 1.</p>
<p>John&#8217;s experience, collaborative approach, strong leadership, and track record of supporting our efforts in research and creative activities make him the ideal person to lead the Office of Research. He arrived on campus in 2017 as a Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry and was named Associate Vice Chancellor for Research in 2019. Since then, he has improved the effectiveness of the office and supported the growth of research activity across all divisions, promoting research and researchers.</p>
<p>John established a team of staff members to support grant-proposal preparation campuswide and led the development of new seed fund initiatives within the Office of Research to promote interdisciplinary research and support individual faculty development and proof-of-concept studies for technology development. He was a key player in the establishment of the UCSC Innovation and Business Engagement (IBE) Hub and partnered with campus leadership to obtain funds for and launch the Center for Coastal Climate Resilience. This $20 million initiative brings together campus expertise across all five academic divisions to address the impacts of climate change on coastal communities.</p>
<p>John also co-led multiple aspects of the campus response to the COVID pandemic, including plans to prioritize the health of researchers while limiting impacts on research; the development of a COVID-19 campus testing plan; and administrative oversight of the Molecular Diagnostics Lab, which we launched in the early months of the pandemic.</p>
<p>He is a collaborative leader with a deep understanding of the intricacies of research and administration. I am excited to see the ways in which our research and creative activities will grow and evolve with John&#8217;s continued leadership.</p>
<p>Prior to joining our campus, he was at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas as an assistant professor, then associate professor, then as holder of the Martha Steiner Professorship in Medical Sciences. He earned his Ph.D. in chemistry at UC Davis and his bachelor&#8217;s in chemistry at the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>I thank everyone in our campus community who participated in this recruitment. I appreciate the feedback and perspectives you shared after meeting with the finalists. We had strong candidates to consider, each offering unique skills and strengths. I believe our campus will be well served with John leading our Office of Research.</p>

<p>Me emociona anunciar que John MacMillan, quien ha servido como Vicerrector de Investigaciones interino desde julio del 2021, ha aceptado nuestra propuesta de servir en ese cargo de manera permanente, a partir del jueves, 1&#186; de junio.</p>
<p>La experiencia, actitud colaborativa, fuerte liderazgo, trayectoria en apoyo de nuestro empe&#241;o en investigaciones y actividades creativas de John hacen de &#233;l la persona ideal para dirigir la Oficina de Investigaciones. &#201;l lleg&#243; al campus en el 2017 como Profesor de Qu&#237;mica y Bioqu&#237;mica y fue nombrado Vicerrector Asociado de Investigaciones en el 2019. Desde entonces, &#233;l ha mejorado la efectividad del cargo y apoyado el auge de las actividades de investigaciones en todas las divisiones, promoviendo las investigaciones y a los investigadores.</p>
<p>John estableci&#243; un equipo de miembros del personal para dar apoyo a la preparaci&#243;n de propuestas para subvenciones en todo el campus y dirigi&#243; el desarrollo de nuevas iniciativas de fondos seminales dentro de la Oficina de Investigaciones para promocionar investigaciones interdisciplinarias y apoyar el desarrollo individual de la facultad y estudios de prueba-de-conceptos en el desarrollo de tecnolog&#237;a. Fue una figura clave en el establecimiento del Centro de Innovaci&#243;n y Compromiso Empresarial (IBE, por sus siglas en ingl&#233;s) de la UCSC y se ali&#243; con los dirigentes del campus a fin de conseguir fondos para, e iniciar, el Centro para la Resiliencia Costera al Clima. Esta iniciativa de $20 millones agrupa la pericia del campus en sus cinco divisiones acad&#233;micas respecto a los impactos del cambio clim&#225;tico sobre las comunidades costeras.</p>
<p>John tambi&#233;n co-dirigi&#243; m&#250;ltiples aspectos de la respuesta del campus a la pandemia de COVID, inclusive los planes para dar prioridad a la salud de los investigadores a la vez que se limitaban los impactos a las investigaciones; el desarrollo de un plan para hacer pruebas de COVID-19 en el campus; y la supervisi&#243;n administrativa del Laboratorio de Diagn&#243;sticos Moleculares, el cual nosotros pusimos en marcha en los primeros meses de la pandemia.</p>
<p>&#201;l es un l&#237;der que colabora con una profunda comprensi&#243;n de las complejidades y administraci&#243;n de las investigaciones. Me emociona ver las formas en que nuestras investigaciones y actividades creativas crecer&#225;n y evolucionar&#225;n bajo el liderazgo continuo de John.</p>
<p>Antes de unirse a nuestro campus, &#233;l estuvo en el Centro M&#233;dico de la Universidad del Sudoeste de Texas en Dallas como profesor asistente, luego fue profesor asociado, y m&#225;s adelante ocup&#243; la C&#225;tedra Martha Steiner como Profesor de Ciencias M&#233;dicas. Recibi&#243; su Ph.D. en Qu&#237;mica en la UC Davis y su bachillerato en Qu&#237;mica en la Universidad de Iowa.</p>
<p>Le agradezco a todos los de nuestra comunidad del campus que participaron en su reclutamiento. Y aprecio Ios comentarios y perspectivas que Uds. compartieron tras reunirse con los finalistas. Tuvimos en consideraci&#243;n a varios candidatos fuertes, cada uno de ellos ofrec&#237;a destrezas y puntos fuertes &#250;nicos. Creo que nuestro campus ser&#225; bien servido con la direcci&#243;n de John en nuestra Oficina de Investigaciones.</p>
<p>Por favor, acomp&#225;&#241;enme en congratular a John en este merecido nombramiento.</p>

With everything online, Abad strongly felt the absence of in-person interactions with his peers and professors, and was finding it difficult to stay on top of all his responsibilities.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;That first quarter was a struggle,&#8221; said Abad Jr., who is now an Implementation Engineer at NexHealth. &#8220;I was a full time student, a TA for linear algebra, and working in a research lab &#8212; it was really hard to juggle my time.&#8221;<br/><br/>Abad Jr. told Pascale Garaud, professor of Applied Mathematics, about the challenges he was facing with time management. At the time, he was not yet part of the Next Generation Scholars in Applied Mathematics (Next Gen SAM) program, which supports students in the 4+1 pathway for the Scientific Computing and Applied Mathematics master&#8217;s.<br/><br/>The Next Gen SAM program provides students scholarships of up to $10,000 a year based on their financial need, along with additional support such as counseling and career readiness workshops. Launched in 2020, it is currently funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant and often supports students who are first generation college students.<br/><br/>&#8220;As the adviser for our BS/MS pathway program, I see many students in Ferdinand's situation, who are trying to finance their graduate studies being a TA, working in labs, or working second jobs &#8212; and at the same time taking several courses to keep up with our accelerated program course load. It's really hard and stressful,&#8221; Garaud said. &#8220;But they are also driven, hard working, really smart, and so a little help is sometimes all that is needed to put them on the path to success. The Next Gen SAM scholarship means that they do not have to work the extra shift to make ends meet, or simply alleviates some of the stress of having to pay the next bill."&#160;<br/><br/>Garaud, who runs the Next Gen SAM program, was able to get Abad Jr. involved for the following quarter where he made connections with other students in the Next Gen SAM cohort. They formed a working group to help each other think through the proofs and theorems they were learning in class, bouncing ideas off of each other.<br/><br/>Abad Jr. and a group of students also created a Discord server &#8212; a popular online forum for chatting and collaborating &#8212; to facilitate the connections they couldn&#8217;t create in person. They created channels for different courses to get help with homework and studying techniques and a &#8220;virtual library&#8221; &#8212; a Zoom link that stayed open 24/7 where students could pop in and out for help or for company while they studied.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;That really helped accelerate my success,&#8221; Abad Jr. said. &#8220;It helped build a sense of community, and helped me learn a lot more and get more value out of the classes and lectures.&#8221;<br/><br/>Abad Jr. said the group also helped to relieve feelings of stress and impostor syndrome as he realized that everyone was feeling challenged by the coursework and could work together to solve those challenges.<br/><br/>Kenzie Milhous, a Next Gen SAM alumna who is now a Software Engineer at Boeing, also found support through the close nature of the both programs. Both students noted the genuine care they felt from the professors in the program, who were interested in their success in and out of the classroom.<br/><br/>Milhous appreciated the computer lab specifically for Next Gen SAM students and the spaces dedicated to students where peers could collaborate and work through challenging problems together.<br/><br/>For Milhous, the most beneficial aspect of the program was the career workshops, which she felt gave her a unique chance to learn from alums of the Next Gen SAM program, who faced similar challenges and opportunities to her. She hopes to be able to serve future students as part of a similar alumni program.<br/><br/>&#8220;I liked to see how other people, who started from the position that I did, got to where they are, which direction they went in,&#8221; Milhous said. &#8220;That was really helpful for me to see and be able to ask them questions.&#8221;<br/><br/>Milhous said she also appreciated the one-on-one counseling that Next Gen SAM students received quarterly which supported both their academic and personal lives, directing the students toward resources on campus if needed.&#160;<br/><br/>Both Milhous and Abad Jr. felt that the coursework from the program gave them the extra time and skills they needed to be successful in their careers. Milhous decided to do the 4+1 program after her undergraduate studies in computer engineering in order to give herself a more robust skillset but also draw on her past studies.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I was drawn to the program because there was a broad range of careers that you could apply it to &#8212; I could see it could lead me to dozens upon dozens of different job areas and opportunities,&#8221; Milhous said. &#8220;I liked that because I didn&#8217;t want to be tied down to just a small pool of options after graduation.&#8221;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>Abad Jr. also noted the program gave him the time and skills to feel ready to enter the workforce. Now as a software engineer, he sees the classes from the program have been relevant in his post-graduate career, especially in the way the theories were connected to real-world code and applications.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Knowing the under-the-hood theorems and proofs gives you a more holistic view on how things work, and if something in the code goes wrong, it gives you a better understanding of what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7375658e807270466529d724cefc8619"><name>moschkovich-national-appointments</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Judit Moschkovich joins two national leadership programs for mathematics education</title><summary>Moschkovich is now a member of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's U.S. National Commission on Mathematics Instruction and a co chair of the National Academy of Education's Equity in Math Education Research Grants (EMERG) Program. </summary><start-date>1685516400000</start-date><path>/2023/05/moschkovich-national-appointments</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/moschkovich-national-appointments</link><created-by>asoergel</created-by><created-on>1685564253562</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1685564253562</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Education</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>asoergel@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/06/images/moschkovich.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/06/images/moschkovich.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moschkovich.jpg</name><file-size>11473</file-size><width>228</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>Professional portrait of Judit Moschkovich</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2018/02/images/moschkovich-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2018/02/images/moschkovich-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>moschkovich-80.jpg</name><display-name>moschkovich-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>3692</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Professional portrait of Judit Moschkovich</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Professor&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Judit Moschkovich</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education Professor and Social Sciences Associate Dean for Equity and Justice Judit Moschkovich recently received two national appointments that will draw upon her expertise in equitable mathematics education.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span>Hundreds of growers of&#160;organic vegetables and fruit across California and industry professionals have learned how to manage nitrogen fertilization in a series of workshops, thanks to a collaboration spearheaded by UC Cooperative Extension small farms advisor Margaret Lloyd, with support from UC Santa Cruz-based organic production specialist Joji Muramoto. The program is helping to improve the state&#8217;s organic farming production, which can ultimately benefit every Californian&#8217;s access to organic food.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Nitrogen management is a major issue affecting organic growers,&#8221; said Lloyd. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to them from an economic standpoint, from a regulatory standpoint and from an environmental standpoint. We have many researchers who can speak to this topic and we wanted to provide training and targeted resources focused on organic production.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Inherently the organic system is more complex than conventional systems because microbiological activities are involved that are affected by the climate, by moisture and by other factors,&#8221; said statewide UCCE organic production specialist Joji Muramoto. &#8220;We strive to provide the most current information, continually updating it to accurately reflect the latest science &#8211; which changes quickly &#8211; in a way that&#8217;s easily understandable.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;And we work to improve participants&#8217; understanding of management dynamics and management strategy for organic production so they are more prepared for reporting their nitrogen budgets according to the regulations,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span>Other collaborators include Daniel Geisseler, UC Cooperative Extension specialist in nutrient management at UC Davis; Richard Smith, UC Cooperative Extension vegetable crops advisor; and Patricia Lazicki, Vegetable Crops Advisor, UCCE Capitol Corridor (Yolo, Solano and Sacramento counties).</span></p>
<h2>Significant learning opportunities</h2>
<p><span>Muramoto, who is based at UC Santa Cruz, values the continual learning that happens when working with his colleagues. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned what is going on in the Central Valley, which is so important,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I learned from Daniel Geisseler&#8217;s strong background in nitrogen dynamics and from Patricia Lazicki&#8217;s great Ph.D. work on organic fertilizer mineralization. And I always enjoy working with Richard Smith because of his dedication, vast knowledge, and experience in fertility management in vegetable production.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Lloyd said she has deepened her knowledge of each collaborator and of the extension process of developing materials, conducting statewide workshops, and publishing collaborative articles. &#8220;I'm not a soil scientist or a nutrient scientist, so I was starting from scratch from a thematic standpoint,&#8221; she commented. &#8220;I learned a lot and continue to learn each time I hear the presentations as well as the questions and comments from participants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Workshop topics, which continually evolve, have included completing a nitrogen budget, synchronizing nitrogen release with nitrogen demand, using soil tests, estimating nitrogen release from different sources, regulatory compliance and more.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We keep tweaking and updating the content, which is a real strength of the collaboration,&#8221; Lloyd said. &#8220;And I&#8217;m proud of the strong visuals and tools we developed that are user-friendly from a practitioner standpoint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>In response to participant feedback, the collaborators added a major component on microbes and included Spanish interpretation. &#8220;Continuing to listen to our participants to improve what we&#8217;re doing is key,&#8221; Lloyd emphasized. &#8220;And it&#8217;s rewarding to continually tap into our UC resources and invite different guests to the workshop. It keeps it fresh and interesting.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;One particularly valuable part of these workshops is the opportunity for discussion with the participants,&#8221; Lazicki agreed. &#8220;We often get thought-provoking questions which challenge our assumptions, help us refine our messaging or suggest areas where more research is needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Enrollment in 2022 was higher than the previous year, underscoring the importance of the work and the growing reputation of the program. &#8220;It&#8217;s so encouraging how positive the feedback has been, and we continue to have people sign up, which signals the demand and validates that it&#8217;s a valuable workshop,&#8221; Lloyd observed. She is frequently invited to speak on the topic by professional groups and&#160;</span><span>conference organizers, further demonstrating the increasing demand for the information.</span></p>
<h2>Impact multiplies through collaboration</h2>
<p><span>This collaborative effort grew from a chance meeting at a new-hire orientation event, showing the importance of basic networking to advance research and develop extension programming. &#8220;I met Daniel on the bus tour, where we started talking about the issue, and later put two and two together and submitted a proposal,&#8221; said Lloyd.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span>Muramoto and Lloyd urge early career and newer academics to reach out to colleagues and develop collaborations. &#8220;UC ANR colleagues are very open to collaboration,&#8221; said Muramoto. &#8220;It&#8217;s a huge organization and hard to grasp, but it covers the whole state. Don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to specialists and advisors, and to other UC researchers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Lloyd added, &#8220;The impact of your work, the quality of your work and the fun in the process is all expanded and multiplied when you bring in collaborators. It&#8217;s very rewarding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Lloyd encourages people not to be afraid to take on topics outside their main areas of focus. &#8220;It can be overwhelming to come in as an entomologist or weed scientist and think, &#8216;How do I tackle a research and extension project outside of my discipline?&#8217;&#8221; she said. &#8220;But just go for it, and the specialists and colleagues who do have that expertise are right there for you. Don&#8217;t let that stop you from doing what's needed in your region.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Muramoto reflected that it took him several years to build relationships and a network when he came to UC Santa Cruz from Japan. &#8220;That social capital is so important,&#8221; he stressed. &#8220;Without trust, it's hard to do on-farm research and hard to know what their needs are. I had to build the network first and foremost, by visiting people. Now I&#8217;ve brought my whole network to this position, and I keep expanding the network.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Talk to your farmers,&#8221; he added, &#8220;because they need everything &#8211; entomology, soil science, pathology, economic support. Why not band together to meet as many needs as you can?&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="0936efe480727046405ab49070be2098"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><start-date>1451638800000</start-date><path>/2023/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2023/05/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1670896873430</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1671833398385</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
