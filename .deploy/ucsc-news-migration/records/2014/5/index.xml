present the 14th season of <strong>The Miriam Ellis International Playhouse</strong>&#8212;an annual program of fully-staged short theater pieces by students in the Languages and Applied Linguistics Department&#8212;on May 15-18, at 8 p.m. in the Stevenson Event Center. <br/><br/>Directed by the students&#8217; language instructors, the four public performances will feature works in Chinese, French, Russian, Hebrew and Spanish, accompanied by English super-titles. <br/><br/>Admission is free and the community is invited. <br/><br/>This year&#8217;s multicultural program includes <em>Three Pots of Tea</em> by Ting-Ting Wu; scenes from Marcel Pagnol&#8217;s plays, <em>Marius</em> and <em>Fanny</em>; <em>Cheburashka and Crocodile Ghenan</em> by Eduard Usdensky; <em>Songs of Israel</em>--Hebrew music and dance; and Gabriel Garc&#237;a M&#225;rquez&#8217;s <em>Something Very Serious is Going to Happen in this Town.</em> <br/><br/>Founded in 2001 as &#8220;The International Playhouse,&#8221; the program has been officially renamed this year as "The Miriam Ellis International Playhouse," thanks to the establishment of an endowment, spearheaded by Cowell College Provost Faye Crosby and Faye Alexander, an avid community supporter, who gathered gifts from over 100 campus and community donors.<br/><br/>Their fundraising efforts included a series of delectable gourmet French dinners at the Cowell College Provost House, as well as a lottery involving 1,000 paper cranes and the grand prize of an original bronze sculpture donated by artist Marianne de Hatten Groh.<br/><br/>&#8220;As we embark upon our 14th season under a new identity, we look forward to a solid financial footing for the Playhouse as one of the mainstays that make UCSC so extraordinary,&#8221; noted Miriam Ellis, now a lecturer emerita in French. <br/><br/>&#8220;This theater project grew out of the innovative, interdisciplinary approach to learning which marked our campus from its inception,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The rewards to students who have participated have been described as &#8216;life-changing, and &#8216;unforgettable.&#8217;&#8221;<br/><br/>Ellis added that for the past 13 years, the International Playhouse has performed to capacity audiences for its annual performances, typically offering a program of at least four different languages.

<p>UCSC ranked at the top (99.9 percentile) in the key citation index that measures the influence of an institution's research.</p>
<p><em>Times Higher Education</em> uses the same range of 13 performance indicators to rank institutions for its "100 under 50" as it uses for its <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/">World University Rankings</a>, a list on which UCSC ranked 136. There, UCSC ranked second in the world for research influence, tied with Rice University, and behind only MIT.</p>
<p>Citation index measures a university's research influence by the number of times its published works are cited by scholars across the globe. The data are drawn from the 12,000 academic journals indexed by Thomson Reuters' Web of Science database and include all indexed journals published between 2007 and 2011.</p>
<p>The research influence indicator, weighted at 30 percent of the overall score, is the single most influential and looks at the role of universities in spreading new knowledge and ideas.</p>
<p>"The citations help show us how much each university is contributing to the sum of human knowledge: they tell us whose research has stood out, has been picked up and built on by other scholars and, most importantly, has been shared around the global scholarly community to push further the boundaries of our collective understanding, irrespective of discipline," <em>THE</em> said in explaining the methodology. <br/> <br/> <em>THE</em> said it reduces the weight of subjective indicators for academic reputation and prestige for the younger universities, reasoning that older universities have more time to build a reputation with deeper, wider, "and more established alumni networks with graduates more likely to hold senior positions in universities and society at large, all of which can bolster their reputations."</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine, both founded in 1965, were the only U.S. universities to rank in the top dozen overall on the "100 under 50." Irvine was fifth. Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea was ranked first. All three held the same positions a year ago.</p>
<p>The principal criteria <em>THE</em> uses are:<br/> &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Research: volume, income and reputation (30 percent);<br/> &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Citations: research influence; (30 percent);<br/> &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Teaching: the learning environment (30 percent)<br/> &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; International outlook: people and research (7.5 percent);<br/> &#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160; Industry income: innovation (2.5 percent)</p>
<p><em>Times Higher Education is </em>a weekly British magazine based in London reporting specifically on news and other issues related to higher education. Its World University Rankings first appeared in 2004.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014/one-hundred-under-fifty</url><title>Times Higher Education 100 under 50</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/02/research-influence.html</url><title>Previous coverage on world research influence</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/world-ranking/institution/university-of-california-santa-cruz</url><title>Times Higher Education World Rankings</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014/one-hundred-under-fifty/methodology</url><title>Methodology for 100 under 50 list</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b9c016c2807270464436f0c978abe4aa"><name>sab-nominations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>SAB Call for Nominations - 3 openings</title><summary>I am pleased to announce the nomination period for 2014-2015 Staff Advisory Board (SAB) members is now open.</summary><start-date>1399014000000</start-date><display-name>SAB Call for Nominations</display-name><path>/2014/05/sab-nominations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/sab-nominations</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1398980744856</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1399045635628</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>I am pleased to announce the nomination period for 2014-2015 Staff Advisory Board (SAB) members is now open.&#160; There are three openings for the upcoming year.&#160; Nominations must be submitted to <a href="mailto:sabnominations@ucsc.edu">sabnominations@ucsc.edu</a> no later than May 9th, 2014 by 5 p.m.<br/><br/><b>About the SAB</b><br/><br/> The mission of the UC Santa Cruz Staff Advisory Board is to support both the educational goals of the University and the welfare and diversity of the staff.

<p>He he will travel to Berlin, Halle, Herrnhut, and G&#246;ttingen, Germany for one year to conduct archival research for his dissertation project on a small group of early modern German Protestants called the Moravian Brethren.</p>
<p>Focusing on Moravian correspondence, personal diaries, spiritual memoirs, and poetic literature, Pietrenka will study how common Moravian believers facilitated a transatlantic sense of individual and collective identity, which consequently produced common understandings of race, gender, and sexuality that differed, often quite extensively, from both the religious and secular leaders of Moravian communities, Germans in Europe, and British colonists in North America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>His critical engagement with the historical issues of social identity and religious radicalism will yield a deeper understanding of how marginalized ethnic and religious groups in America affect mainstream culture and adapt in spaces they consider foreign.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bd8ad4b8807270464436f0c961a2ad5e"><name>graduate-symposium</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grad students in the spotlight at Graduate Research Symposium May 9 </title><summary>The 10th annual Graduate Research Symposium will take place on Friday, May 9, at McHenry Library.</summary><keywords>Tyrus Miller, Graduate Research Symposium, graduate student research</keywords><start-date>1399014000000</start-date><display-name>Graduate Research Symposium </display-name><path>/2014/05/graduate-symposium</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/graduate-symposium</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1399044363409</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1399309817963</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Events</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/symposium-banner2014-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/symposium-banner2014-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>symposium-banner2014-375.jpg</name><display-name>symposium-banner2014-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>63517</file-size><width>375</width><height>120</height></image><image-alt>symposium announcement banner</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/symposium-banner-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/symposium-banner-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>symposium-banner-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>symposium-banner-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25065</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>pointing hand from symposium banner</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/samuel-vohr-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/samuel-vohr-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>samuel-vohr-250.jpg</name><display-name>samuel-vohr-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>55415</file-size><width>250</width><height>218</height></image><image-alt>grad student presenter at 2013 symposium</image-alt><image-caption><p>Biomolecular engineering graduate student Samuel Vohr at the 2013 Graduate Research Symposium.

The event takes place from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. in the "Information Commons South" area on the second floor of McHenry Library.</p>
<p>The symposium will include graduate student presentations in a variety of formats, including posters, 10-minute talks, films, and other media.</p>
<p>Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of graduate studies, said the Graduate Research Symposium has become a strong tradition at UCSC that showcases the development and maturing of the campus's graduate programs. "The presentations represent the full breadth and richness of graduate research at UCSC, including theoretical and creative work, lab work and field work. You can really see the diversity in the approaches and modes of research used in different disciplines across campus," he said.</p>
<p>Miller said he was pleased to see students from a broad range of disciplines participating in the symposium, including programs that in the past have not had a strong graduate research presence at UCSC. The Arts Division, for example, is now well represented at the symposium, with graduate students presenting a variety of films, music, multimedia, and other creative works.</p>
<p>The Graduate Research Symposium encourages students to communicate their research in a way that is engaging and accessible to a general audience. A panel of judges will award prizes for best presentations in each division, as well as best-of-symposium awards.</p>
<p>"It's an important opportunity for students to communicate their work to an interested and non-specialized audience, which is different from going to a professional conference. They'll have to translate the specialized language of their discipline into something more accessible," Miller said.</p>

And how will they do it? These questions are at the heart of an international conference next week at UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>"Anthropocene: Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet" begins Thursday evening with a talk by acclaimed science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz. The talk has long been sold out, but simulcast video streaming will be available at two locations on the UCSC campus: the Humanities Lecture Hall (Room 206) and Social Sciences 1 Room 110. The talk and broadcast are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.<br/><br/>"Through noticing, describing, and imagining, we renew conversation about life on Earth," is how organizers describe the conference's objectives. <br/><br/>Le Guin spoke of her views on the subject in an <a href="http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/5605-control-issues.html">extensive interview with the Good Times</a> weekly newspaper. "Well, we&#8217;re at a point where how many species go extinct everyday due to human interference? How many oil spills are we going to have? How many people are running around shooting school children with repeater guns? Things are not going well," she said. <br/><br/>The conference was conceived by UCSC anthropology professor Anna Tsing and is co-presented by the UCSC Anthropology Department&#8217;s Emerging Worlds initiative and Denmark's Aarhus University Research on the Anthropocene project. The term Anthropocene is a new one, used to describe the geologic epoch defined by human disturbance of the earth&#8217;s ecosystems. <br/>&#160;<br/>Last year, Tsing won a $5 million Niels Bohr Professorship from the Danish National Research Foundation with which she is establishing a program encompassing the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, and the arts in an exploration the Anthropocene. <br/><br/>Aarhus is Denmark's largest and second oldest university. Founded in 1928, it is located about 120 miles west of Copenhagen. Tsing spent last fall quarter at Aarhus and will teach and conduct research there during the 2014-2015 academic year. She spent time at the university in 2010 on a Guggenheim fellowship. <br/><br/>The conference will continue Friday and Saturday with series of talks that are free and open to the public. All will be held at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room on the UCSC campus.

<p><em>Rent </em>spotlights a group of bohemian artists--several of whom are living with AIDS&#8212;as they struggle to hold on to their friendships and non-conformist ideals in New York's East Village.</p>
<p>Jonathan Larson wrote the book, lyrics, and music for the 1996 rock musical, based on Giacomo Puccini's popular opera&#160;<i>La Boh&#232;me<b>,</b></i>&#160;which premiered in 1896. Larson&#160;modified the disease in the play from tuberculosis to AIDS and recast the story from 19th-century Paris to contemporary New York.&#160;</p>
<p>Although <em>Rent</em> is often presented as an energetic and touching musical celebration of art, love, friendship, and life, Scheie has a different idea for the UCSC production-- planning to place extra emphasis on the show's social and political themes.</p>
<p>"Somehow&#160;<i>Rent</i> got kind of 'cute' in the American imagination," Scheie noted. "I'd like to rediscover some of the more angry, revolutionary elements in the show."</p>
<p>This is a busy month for Scheie. In addition to his active teaching and directing schedule, the award-winning actor can also be seen in Joe Orton's&#160;<i>What the Butler Saw</i>, opening May 2 at the <a href="http://www.jeweltheatre.net"><em><strong>Jewel Theatre Company</strong></em></a> in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Music director&#160;Colin Hannon, who worked with Scheie on UCSC's hit production of&#160;<i>Hair</i>&#160;in 2010, will lead the band for <em>Rent</em>.</p>
<p>Theater Arts Professor&#160;David Lee Cuthbert,<b> </b>who recently<b> </b>designed the lighting for&#160;Billy Crystal's show<i>&#160;700 Sundays&#160;</i>on Broadway (<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/cuthbert-billy-crystal.html"><em><strong>and for the HBO special</strong></em></a>), is the lighting and set designer.&#160;</p>

<p>"It was a wonderful week for me," Lay said. "This was sequential recognition from both the broad scientific community and my disciplinary specialty, and I had the very unusual pleasure of receiving many double messages of congratulations. Recognition like these is enabled by the generous efforts of many colleagues, and also reflects programmatic efforts of my many collaborators and students over time, so there are many who share in these announcements."</p>
<p>The Harry Fielding Reid Medal is awarded for outstanding contributions in seismology and earthquake engineering. The announcement that Lay would receive the 2014 medal was made at the annual meeting of the SSA in Anchorage on Wednesday, April 30--just before a ceremony at which the 2013 medal was presented to Kerry Sieh, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore. Lay will receive the 2014 medal at the SSA meeting in Pasadena next year.</p>
<p>"This is the highest honor for achievement in seismology," said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences at UCSC. "The past recipient list is impressive, a who's who on earth structure, earthquake engineering, and global scientific leadership."</p>
<p>Lay, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC, is an expert on the physics of earthquake faulting and the use of seismic waves to study the deep structure of the Earth's interior, as well as the development of seismological methods for monitoring nuclear test ban treaties. His investigations of recent powerful earthquakes around the world include rapid determination of fault parameters using broadband seismic waves. He has served on many national and international committees, including terms as chair of the board of directors of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology and chair of the National Research Council's Committee on Seismology.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d271e1b1807270464436f0c91ce9448a"><name>ecommons-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Survey on eCommons and campus learning systems</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is interested in improving your experiences using eCommons, and your response to the survey below is very important to us.</summary><start-date>1399359600000</start-date><display-name>Survey on eCommons and campus learning systems</display-name><path>/2014/05/ecommons-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/ecommons-survey</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1399395049862</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1399395257885</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><br/>I invite faculty and staff to provide input concerning the functionality and support of eCommons via a short survey open from April 30 - <br/>May 16, 2014.&#160; UC Santa Cruz is interested in improving your experiences using eCommons, and your response to the survey below is very important to us.&#160; In addition to determining the value of current features, your feedback will also inform decisions concerning product enhancements and improvements in support.<br/><br/>Faculty are encouraged to complete this survey regardless of whether they use eCommons, other learning management systems besides eCommons, or none at all.<br/><br/>Your participation in the study is voluntary, and your responses will be completely confidential.

<p>Helou&#8217;s $30,000 fellowship is one of 64 awarded this year to advanced graduate students "pursuing promising and ambitious Ph.D research" from 32 universities and more than a dozen humanistic disciplines. Fellows were selected from a pool of nearly 1,000 applicants through a multi-stage peer-review process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellowship program intervenes at a critical juncture in a scholar&#8217;s professional development,&#8221; said Matthew Goldfeder, director of fellowship programs at ACLS. &#8220;It aims to support fellows in the final year of dissertation writing as they improve the project that will form the basis of their early postdoctoral research agenda and publications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helou&#8217;s dissertation, "Figures of Voice in Early Modern Europe," explores theories of vocality in modern and early modern sources, and examines the status of voice as a nexus of lyrical expression, affect, and embodiment in Renaissance poetry, drama, and music.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe strongly in academic work that combines both theory and practice, so in addition to my scholarly research, I am also active in early music performance as a woodwind player and singer, and in theater as a dramaturg and language specialist,&#8221; said Helou. &#8232;</p>
<p>My secondary research field is food studies--food writing and history of gastronomy.&#160;I am in the process of putting some of my translations of early modern cookbooks online at <a href="renaissancefood.wordpress.com">renaissancefood.wordpress.com</a>,&#8221; she added.</p>

The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>Abel is a computational cosmologist who explores cosmic history using supercomputer calculations. An associate professor of physics at Stanford University and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, he directs the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford.</p>
<p>In his talk, Abel will take the audience on a fascinating journey through the early universe using the latest computer animations of early star formation, supernova explosions, and the build-up of the first galaxies. His work has shown that the first luminous objects in the universe were very massive stars shining one million times as brightly as our sun. They died quickly and seeded the cosmos with the chemical elements necessary for life. One star at a time, galaxies started to assemble just one hundred million years after the Big Bang, and they are still growing now. Computer simulations of these events combine the physics of dark matter and the ordinary matter of atoms and molecules, the expansion of the universe, chemistry, and gas dynamics to deliver remarkable insights into the early history of the cosmos.</p>
<p>Abel's long-term goal is "to build a galaxy, one star at a time," via computer modeling. Among his research interests are the processes and events of "the dark ages," the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang. His visualizations and simulations of dark ages events have led to over 100 publications in the technical literature and have been featured on PBS, the Discovery Channel, and the covers of <i>Discover</i> and <i>National Geographic.</i></p>

<p>After a national search for the University Registrar, the Division of Undergraduate Education is pleased to announce the appointment of Tchad Sanger.</p>
<p>The University Registrar provides leadership on matters related to policies and programs that serve as structural support for the instructional mission of the campus and provides support for <a href="http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/success">student success</a> and graduation. The <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/">Office of the Registrar</a> includes a professional staff of 22, 3-5 student staff, and has budgetary responsibility for $1.3 million. The University Registrar plays a critical role in shaping the technological vision for the campus in support of undergraduate and graduate education, collaborating on the development, prioritization, and implementation of technological solutions within applicable student data systems. The University Registrar is an <em>ex officio</em> member of the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/">Academic Senate</a>, serves on its <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/committees/cep-committee-on-educational-policy/">Committee on Educational Policy</a> (CEP), and is charged with implementing and interpreting relevant academic policy as established by the Academic Senate. The University Registrar is the campus compliance officer for the privacy of student information and the <a href="http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/ferpa">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a> (FERPA).</p>
<p>Tchad received his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is currently Interim University Registrar, following the retirement of Pamela Hunt-Carter last year. He began his career on campus in 1993 as Public Information Adviser in the Office of the Registrar. He later transitioned to College Eight and then Stevenson in advising roles before serving as a Coordinating Academic Preceptor in 2002, where he was instrumental in the conversion to the current Academic Information System (AIS) in 2004. He later served as the Advising and Degree Audit Process Manager, before becoming the Associate Registrar - Advising, Records, and Enrollment in 2006. Tchad has served as an AIS Team Lead/Project member since 1999. He also served as the Chair for the <a href="http://www.uclgbtia.org/">UC Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex Association</a> and Co-Chair for the UC Santa Cruz Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Community Concerns Committee, where he advocated for same-sex domestic partner benefits, and inclusion and safety for transgender and intersex communities.</p>
<p>Tchad is known for working tirelessly on behalf of students, faculty, staff and alumni. As he moves into his new campus leadership role, he will be supporting his team in managing the complex processes associated with supporting student goals to degree completion. Tchad leads by example and believes in the mission of UC Santa Cruz and constantly seeks ways to improve student satisfaction.</p>
<p>Tchad&#8217;s expertise and years of experience at UCSC has him poised to initiate needed technological and structural change, and his initial priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>review current organization of the Office of the Registrar and provide a structure to best serve campus constituencies;</li>
<li>review options to support curriculum management through integrated course approval and interactive course catalog; and</li>
<li>continue to automate and develop efficient processes for advisers, staff, and faculty to allow more proactive and personalized service to students in support of retention and graduation. These will include AIS enhancements, report development in support of curricular management and early identification of at risk students, and enhanced graduation processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within his role of campus compliance officer for the privacy of student information, Tchad will continue to engage the campus in best practices and legal requirements, such as through the <a href="http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/ferpa">Registrar's Online FERPA Training</a>, recommended for all individuals who interact with students in any capacity.</p>
<p>Tchad can be reached at <a href="mailto:cpsanger@ucsc.edu">cpsanger@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

"Although we see that there is more presence of shade-marketed and shade-certified coffees in the U.S. than we saw in 1990, there is actually a smaller fraction of coffee production area that is dedicated to diverse shade production." <br/><br/>"The implications are significant," Philpott said, "as we also show that ecosystem services, such as predation services, pollination, and climate adaptation are better provided in diverse shade production than in systems with less shade." If the trend continues, she said, "coffee farms may begin to rely even more on non-natural inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers." <br/><br/>Additional co-authors include two who earned their Ph.D.s at UCSC, Christopher Bacon, now at Santa Clara University, and V. Ernesto M&#233;ndez, at the University of Vermont.<br/><br/><strong>Diverse canopy</strong><br/><br/>Traditional shade-grown coffee is cultivated under a diverse canopy of native forest trees in dense to moderate shade. Though some forest understory is cleared for farming, a rich web of plant and animal life remains. Shade grown coffee plantations provide corridors for migrating birds, attract and support economically valuable pollinators such as bees and bats, and provide ecosystem services such as filtering water and air, stabilizing soil during heavy rains, storing carbon, and replenishing soil nutrients.<br/><br/>In the United States, the market for specialty coffee, which includes organic and shade-grown varieties, has grown rapidly during the past decade. Across most U.S. distributors, sales of specialty coffee rose more than 75 percent by economic value from 2000 to 2008. In 2012, specialty coffees accounted for 37 percent of U.S. coffee sales by volume and nearly half by economic value, an estimated $30 billion to $32 billion.<br/><br/>The study also found that since 1990, the land area under coffee cultivation has contracted in Africa and expanded in Asia. Most of the new production is done in an intensive style that is characterized by clearing forests or pasture for cultivation, increasing the density of plantings, and switching to a variety of coffee called Robusta that tolerates full sun. Robusta is a lower-quality coffee than the other major variety sold around the world, Arabica. The two strains are often blended to produce instant coffee.<br/><br/><strong>Quest for profits</strong><br/><br/>Jha and colleagues say the shifting trends toward Asia and a more intensive style of farming are driven by a dramatic drop in global coffee prices. To remain profitable, some growers have moved, seeking lower land and labor costs and higher short-term yields.<br/><br/>But there are hidden costs to this more intensive style. Full sun coffee plantations often result in deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and soil depletion while leaving communities more vulnerable to flooding and landslides.<br/><br/>Because the up-front costs of getting certified to sell specialty coffees can be expensive, Jha and colleagues encourage government agencies, conservation groups and aid organizations to partner with farmers to develop strategies to get more farmers into shade-grown coffee production.<br/><br/>Other co-authors are Peter L&#228;derach, International Center for Tropical Agriculture, Nicaragua, and Robert Rice, Migratory Bird Center at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/5/416.full</url><title>Article in BioScience </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.utexas.edu/news/2014/04/16/shade-grown-coffee-shrinking/</url><title>University of Texas, Austin press release </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8621133807270464436f0c9d4ac5e70"><name>edge-of-eden-parking</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus Access and Parking this Saturday</title><summary>This Saturday, May 10, the Student Union Assembly is sponsoring the Edge of Eden Music Festival on UCSC's East Field.

Several thousand concertgoers will start arriving by 2pm and stay until the show ends at 10pm. We anticipate heavy traffic congestion along Bay Street, Coolidge Drive, and Hagar Drive as concertgoers arrive and depart. In addition, from 5pm until approximately 11:30pm, Hagar Drive will be closed between the East Remote parking lot and Quarry Plaza.<br/><br/>Concertgoers arriving by car will be charged a flat $10 parking fee upon entry as directed to any parking lots on the east side of campus (e.g. East Remote, Cowell, Stevenson, Merrill, or Hahn). Campus residents who regularly park in the East Remote are requested to relocate their cars Saturday morning to the West Remote or North Remote lots, or to parking lots located at Oakes, College Eight, or Kresge that don't require permits on weekends. Please check parking lot entry signs at these lots for hours when permits are rehired, as Parking Enforcement will be active throughout the day.<br/><br/>"Regular" campus life&#8212;as well as several other special events&#8212;will also be taking place across campus Saturday. Persons traveling to campus should consider using SCMTD transit, or driving through the West Entrance if arriving at or after 2pm.<br/><br/>Concertgoers are strongly encouraged to use public transit to travel to and from the event. Attendees can ride fare-free throughout the day on all SCMTD Metro buses serving UCSC (Routes 10, 16, 19, and 20) by displaying a printed Edge of Eden ticket when boarding. Metro bus service along Laurel, Mission, and Bay Streets will be increased to provide extra capacity throughout the afternoon and evening.<br/><br/>On-campus transit route modifications will be in place from 5pm until approximately 11:30pm. SCMTD Metro buses and Night Loop shuttles will travel counterclockwise through the campus (from the Main Entrance up Hagar and across campus, then out the West Entrance). During these hours the East Night Core shuttle will not serve The Village or the East Remote parking lot. Night Owl shuttles will operate on their normal Saturday service schedule.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Nader Oweis, University Police Chief; Larry Pageler, Transportation and Parking Services Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d9053b97807270464436f0c90cbdaa55"><name>rev-spring-14-chancellor-note</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From the chancellor: Become an associate</title><summary>Among the most gratifying aspects of being the chancellor of UC Santa Cruz is meeting people who care deeply about the campus.

This place speaks to our hearts and minds, evoking genuine affection that often grows stronger over time.</p>
<p>One group that shares a commitment to UCSC is the Chancellor's Associates, a giving society made up of individuals who value our campus mission of teaching, research, and public service. They donate to a fund I've used to support meaningful projects, including expanding the library, underwriting innovative research, and providing career-building internships.</p>
<p>Students who participate in the Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program (CUIP) are among the beneficiaries. These students work in units across campus, from admissions to sustainability, developing personal and professional skills as they take the lead on a significant, year-long project. Each intern is matched with a mentor who provides support along the way.</p>
<p>As part of a seminar course associated with the internship, I meet with the CUIP interns twice every year. They are always an impressive group, and I come away inspired by each visit.</p>
<p>Student Bailey McWhorter (Porter '14, film and digital media) is a CUIP intern working with UCSC's Good Neighbor Initiative, which promotes positive relations between UCSC and the City of Santa Cruz. Bailey works with the city to address student-related issues, serving as a bridge to facilitate the "town-gown" relationship.</p>
<p>In addition, she and her fellow interns organized a community and arts festival in downtown Santa Cruz featuring student artists and performers, university organizations, and live music. The festival showcased what's happening at UCSC and sparked connections and conversations with members of the community.</p>
<p>In the process, Bailey gained valuable career experience in marketing and politics&#8212;hands-on opportunities that enhance what she has learned in the classroom.</p>
<p>As I hope you know, UCSC recently kicked off its first-ever major fundraising effort, The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz. Our goal is to provide new resources to the campus, enabling students and faculty to follow their passions and make their mark on the world&#8212;just as Bailey is doing.</p>
<p>We are making great progress toward the campaign's $300 million goal. We're at $164 million now, and momentum continues to build; see page 2 for a campaign update. All gifts, including those to the Chancellor's Associates, count toward the goal.</p>
<p>If you're passionate about UCSC&#8212; about helping the campus, its students, and faculty reach new heights, solve new problems, and create engaged and involved citizens&#8212; then please join me. Become a Chancellor's Associate and support The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>"I making <em>wadoo!</em>" he shouted gleefully, beaming me a huge smile.</p>
<p>After my heart melted, I got to thinking.</p>
<p>Why <i>can't</i> we make water? We make all sorts of synthetic compounds, from silicone to Velveeta. You'd just need to slam together a couple hydrogens and an oxygen. It would solve an awful lot of problems if we could just manufacture the stuff.</p>
<p>For most of California, 2013 was the driest year in recorded history. Statewide, the seasonal snowpack was less than a third of the average, as reported by the state Department of Water Resources on April 1. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a water emergency on Jan. 17, calling for statewide 20 percent voluntary cutbacks, and some communities are rationing.</p>
<p>The severity of the drought will surely affect one thing that's central to everyone: food. Grocery bills will likely go up because fewer acres of land are being planted and crop yields are shrinking, and the drought could prove devastating to those served by food banks.</p>
<p>Combining two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom to make water sounds simple, but unfortunately, combining these atoms produces a lot of energy&#8212;and could cause dangerous explosions. Also, the quantities of water we need are so vast it seems likely we could never produce enough, and it would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>UCSC researchers are working on options&#8212;and none of them is as risky or hazardous as a hydrogen explosion! The ideas range from conservation to recycled water to the creation of water reserves (see "Dry, dry again").</p>
<p>It's at least comforting to know that bright, passionate people here are working on some of humanity's complex, long-term, seemingly intractable issues. It makes me feel like the future my sons inhabit might turn out to be OK.</p>
<p>Almost instantaneously after my son "made" water, he went on to making "smoothies." Ah, the 2-year-old mind &#8230; it flows as swiftly as a river&#8212;when there isn't a drought.</p>

Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Roberto Manduchi applies computer vision technology to develop products that address daily challenges faced by visually impaired people</article-subhead><article-text><p>Roberto Manduchi joined the computer engineering faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 2001 eager to apply his expertise in computer vision to socially relevant problems that could immediately benefit from technology. Previously, he had worked at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, focusing on sensors that helped robotic vehicles navigate rough terrain.</p>
<p>At UCSC, Manduchi decided to apply his technological expertise to engineering things that improve the daily lives of visually impaired people. He soon realized that reaching that goal requires more than engineering knowledge; it also involves learning about the lives and abilities of another community. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a long process of reeducating myself,&#8221; Manduchi said.</p>
<p>Now he works through teaching and research to spread his broadened perspective to undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>Manduchi&#8217;s first federally-funded assistive technology research produced a "virtual cane" that identified obstacles using lasers as an alternative to the long white cane used by many visually impaired people. Now he considers the project misdirected. &#8220;The technology was substituting for something that already worked well,&#8221; Manduchi said.</p>
<p>He intended to create a product that helped people, but he had not talked to potential users to find out what devices would be most useful. &#160;He has since recognized a pattern that he calls a vicious loop: Academic engineering researchers want to use their algorithms or hardware to help people. The researchers apply for grants, publish papers, and perhaps share their work through the media. However, the devices are not adopted over time, and the researchers return to their labs to develop another product.</p>
<p>&#8220;That leads to frustration and resentment from both researchers and the intended users,&#8221; Manduchi said. &#8220;Researchers wonder why people don&#8217;t use their systems. The user sees another useless gadget, a solution in search of a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Getting to know the community</strong></p>
<p>Manduchi considers his cane project an important experience. It challenged him to learn how the blind community lives and what problems they face each day. By making friends with people who are blind and with those who work with the blind, he&#8217;s learned that the blind community encompasses people with varying abilities to perceive light and is as diverse as the general population in terms of age and mobility. By getting to know the community, he has discovered practical considerations that apply to any project, such as the need for affordability, long battery life, and pleasing aesthetics that do not draw attention to the user. Manduchi now continues to gather user feedback during the research process as he develops any new application.</p>
<p>Some of his current projects include helping blind people navigate using cameras in smartphones and helping them aim the camera so they can photograph a page of text, which enables them to use a text-to-speech algorithm that reads the text aloud.</p>
<p>Manduchi takes care to state that his projects are research prototypes; they&#8217;re not at a stage where they can be used by large groups of people. &#8220;I try not to create hopes that aren&#8217;t there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Though he speaks humbly about his academic research, Manduchi beams with pride when discussing an <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2007/02/1051.html">undergraduate course</a> he started in 2007 to help students learn about disabilities. The course is taught twice a year, and Manduchi&#8217;s fall section regularly has around 200 students. Guest speakers talk about their experiences living with disabilities, and the students work on group projects that get them involved with special needs communities.</p>
<p>This year, students volunteered with <a href="https://benetech.org/">Benetech</a>, a nonprofit organization in Silicon Valley that supports technology development for social impact. They proofread digitized textbooks that will be placed online in formats accessible to visually impaired students. Benetech CEO Jim Fruchterman <a href="http://benetech.org/2013/12/19/uc-santa-cruz-students-volunteering-for-impact-with-bookshare/">praised the project in his blog</a>: "To better understand the achievement of our UC Santa Cruz volunteers, it&#8217;s important to take into account that textbooks are longer and more complicated than the average literature book, and therefore require more proofreading time. Creating an accessible version of a single textbook can take us 90 days or longer and costs $600 or more," he wrote. "The effort of Roberto&#8217;s students has a powerful multiplier effect, as the textbooks they proofed will be available to our Bookshare members all over the country for years to come."</p>
<p>Through his course, Manduchi hopes students learn to see disabilities as normal. That&#8217;s something he feels is especially important at UCSC because it&#8217;s uncommon to see people with physical disabilities around the large, hilly campus.</p>
<p>Other computer engineers at UCSC also focus on helping people with special needs. <a href="http://bionics.soe.ucsc.edu/people/rosen/jacob_rosen.html">Jacob Rosen</a> designs robotic exoskeletons to help people regain mobility after a stroke. <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/&#126;srikur/">Sri Kurniawan</a> designs video games to help teenagers get more exercise and to provide speech therapy for children with cleft palates. Rosen, Kurniawan, and Manduchi bring unique perspectives and philosophies to their individual research, but they all value collaborations with non-engineers and user feedback during the design process.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Bringing together collaborators</strong></p>
<p>In 2012, Manduchi started the <a href="http://matter.ucsc.edu">Maximizing Abilities Through Technology, Education and Research (MATTER) Center</a> to unite the three researchers and their collaborators. Other members of the MATTER center include engineers and psychology researchers from UCSC, as well as nurses, neurologists, and rehabilitation experts from UC San Francisco and UC Davis. Center members have gathered for two workshops, one discussing ways technology can help people stick to a rehabilitation plan and another brainstorming future mobile technology that could be useful for visually impaired people. A stroke survivor and a person with muscular dystrophy attended the first workshop, and <a href="http://blindsight.com/">Blindsight</a>, a Berkeley-based company working to commercialize mobile technology for the blind attended the second.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s still an evolving project, Kurniawan says the center is important because it shows there&#8217;s a unified front of researchers at UCSC working to improve the world for people with special needs.</p>
<p>Manduchi hopes his engineering graduate students will benefit most from the connections with medical and human-focused researchers in the center.</p>
<p>Developing those collaborations is the only way to develop a product that will have an impact on people&#8217;s lives, Rosen said. Collaborations between engineers and doctors, for example, require each group to learn the other&#8217;s language. Manduchi hopes the center will help engineering students learn to work effectively with experts in other fields and users of the technology they&#8217;re developing.</p>
<p>By broadening the education of the next generation of engineers who will be developing products for people with special needs, Manduchi works to reroute the &#8220;vicious loop&#8221; that snared him during early projects. He&#8217;s changing the future for people who use his products, as well as for researchers developing such products.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UCSC Computer Vision Lab</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://matter.ucsc.edu/</url><title>MATTER Center</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="de280d6c807270464436f0c996ad31ba"><name>rev-spring-14-campaign-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campaign update</title><summary>From on-the-ground work in environmental science to facilities that enrich student experiences, philanthropy at every level is bringing critical new resources to UC Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</keywords><start-date>1399532400000</start-date><display-name>Campaign update</display-name><path>/2014/05/rev-spring-14-campaign-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/rev-spring-14-campaign-update</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1399591537978</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1399591537978</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/norris-ken.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/norris-ken.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>norris-ken.jpg</name><display-name>norris-ken.jpg</display-name><file-size>26296</file-size><width>290</width><height>302</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p class="p1">The late UC Santa Cruz professor Ken Norris points out a trap-door spider&#8217;s nest in the field for students in his Natural History of California class.

Give. Don't Give In</article-subhead><article-text><p><b>From on-the-ground work in environmental science to facilities that enrich student experiences, philanthropy at every level is bringing critical new resources to UC Santa Cruz.</b></p>
<p>The campus is reaching out to its alumni and others to increase private support with a goal of $300 million by the end of the campaign. Gifts and grants to date: $164 million.</p>
<h3>Honoring Ken Norris</h3>
<p>A <b>$2 million gift from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation extends and honors the legacy of Kenneth S. Norris,</b> a preeminent professor of natural history at UCSC. The gift will provide enduring support for the Natural History Field Quarter, an intensive and immersive field-based program in natural history that Norris founded, as well as funding for a center for natural history that will be named in Norris's honor. Both are based in the UCSC Environmental Studies Department.</p>
<p>Norris, an acclaimed marine mammal researcher and founder of the UC Natural Reserve System, established UCSC as a national leader in educating students who go on to become environmental leaders in conservation and stewardship of the planet. He retired in 1990, but remained active until shortly before his death in 1998.</p>
<p>As a teacher, Norris was legendary for his ability to inspire students. Beginning in 1973, each spring he led the two-dozen field quarter students into the mountains, forests, and deserts of California to learn from nature firsthand. More than 1,000 students have taken the field quarter; in 2012, 500 of them returned to campus to celebrate its impact on their lives.</p>
<p>The current UCSC Museum of Natural History Collections will be the foundation for the new Norris Center for Natural History. The collection includes more than 125,000 specimens of plants, fungi, lichen, marine algae, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. It supports hands-on laboratory and field activities for more than 20 undergraduate classes, serving 700 to 1,000 students per year. The center will support broader education and research activities across campus and in the Santa Cruz community.</p>
<h3>Among other gifts:</h3>
<p><b>From Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, a two-year $250,000 grant for childhood cancer research in support of Camilla Forsberg's work to identify the root cause of acute lymphocytic leukemia.</b> Forsberg is an associate professor in biomolecular engineering and co-director of the UCSC Institute for the Biology of Stem Cells.</p>
<p><b>From alumnus Bill Hancock (Cowell '79, environmental planning), funding to jumpstart a feasibility study in support of reopening the Quarry Amphitheater.</b> His ties to UCSC run deep: two siblings are also alumni.</p>
<h3>About the campaign</h3>
<p><b>Now at $164 million </b></p>
<p>Launched in October, The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz is comprehensive&#8212;it seeks to build resources all across campus and in signature initiatives. Its goal is to enhance UCSC's extraordinary educational environment, highimpact research, and deep commitment to social and environmental responsibility.</p>

A GPS tracking collar that UC Santa Cruz scientists placed around his neck reveals exactly where he goes. <br/><br/>The adolescent's effort to stretch his legs and establish his own territory took him into the heart of downtown Mountain View earlier this week. Chris Wilmers, UCSC associate professor of environmental studies, points to an on-screen map in his office that shows how 46m took off two weeks ago from his mom's territory near Big Basin in the Santa Cruz Mountains, a behavior known as "dispersal." <br/><br/>Wilmers is able to provide a detailed look at 46m's travels from data downloaded from the collar after he tranquilized him with a dart in the garage of a Mountain View apartment building Tuesday evening (May 6). The collar, developed by UCSC scientists records and transmits data about the animals movements.</p>
<p>Wilmers recounts 46m's journey in a <a href="http://santacruzpumas.org/2014/05/08/a-detailed-look-at-46m-s-journey-from-big-basin-to-mountain-view-mvpuma/">blog post at Santa Cruz Puma Project's website</a>. The puma project is a joint study by UC Santa Cruz and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife that follows mountain lions in the Santa Cruz mountains as they negotiate the intersections of natural habitat and human intrusion. Wilmers said 13 or 14 pumas are being tracked currently. <br/><br/>The cat had spent more than two days in Mountain View, keeping himself hidden until he made a break for it. Data show he spent several daylight hours Tuesday hunkered down in some bushes alongside an apartment building. Pedestrians and motorists just feet away were none the wiser. <br/><br/>"He spent two nights and parts of three days wandering around this highly developed area, and no one had seen him," Wilmers said. <br/><br/>GPS data show the puma first moved north from his home territory April 24, then east, eventually crossing Interstate 280 before dropping into Mountain View.<br/><br/>The mountain lion's suburban escapade attracted several hundred spectators as Mountain View police blocked the area, sent out text alerts, and trained their rifles on the animal hiding under a parked car.</p>
<p>"Mountain View police and Cal Fish and Wildlife did a great job of safely anesthetizing and relocating this animal back into open space," Wilmers said.<br/><br/>Wilmers and his team first captured and collared 46m in January. He's between 18 months and 2 years old and weighed 93 pounds when first collared. His brother 41m was captured and collared last October. Remote video taken before researchers arrived at the capture site showed 46m teasing his brother inside a cage baited with a deer carcass. Other video in February shows 46m feeding on a deer alongside his uncollared mom.<br/><br/>After 46m's second capture, Wilmers and his team transported the puma back into the Santa Cruz Mountains where he will resume his quest for a territory of his own. Wilmers said data from the collar will continue to show his whereabouts. <br/><br/>When in range the data are transmitted via cellular telephone sites as texts; 46M is now a member of the Wilmers family cell phone plan.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://santacruzpumas.org</url><title>Santa Cruz Puma Project website</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://santacruzpumas.org/2014/05/08/a-detailed-look-at-46m-s-journey-from-big-basin-to-mountain-view-mvpuma/</url><title>Details about 46M's travels</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="de4b05a4807270464436f0c9c12d3ab7"><name>mackey-poetry-foundation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC emeritus professor Nathaniel Mackey wins prestigious poetry prize</title><summary>Nathaniel Mackey, professor emeritus of literature at UC Santa Cruz, has been named the winner of the Poetry Foundation’s 2014 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, nathaniel mackey, poetry foundation, 2014 poetry prizes, poetry news</keywords><start-date>1399595400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC emeritus professor Nathaniel Mackey wins poetry prize</display-name><path>/2014/05/mackey-poetry-foundation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/mackey-poetry-foundation</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1399593829742</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400800607661</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/Nate-Mackey-award-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/Nate-Mackey-award-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Nate-Mackey-award-250.jpg</name><display-name>Nate-Mackey-award-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>79891</file-size><width>250</width><height>377</height></image><image-alt>Nathaniel Mackey</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/mackey-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/mackey-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mackey-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mackey-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24476</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Nathaniel Mackey</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Nathaniel Mackey</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>$100,000 award from Poetry Foundation honors lifetime achievement    </article-subhead><article-text><p>Nathaniel Mackey, professor emeritus of literature at UC Santa Cruz, has been named the winner of the <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org"><em><strong>Poetry Foundation&#8217;s</strong></em></a> 2014 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize.</p>
<p>Presented annually to a living U.S. poet whose lifetime accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize is one of the most prestigious awards given to American poets.</p>
<p>The $100,000 award is also one of the nation&#8217;s largest literary prizes.</p>
<p>Established in 1986, the prize is sponsored and administered by the Poetry Foundation, publisher of&#160;<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/"><i>Poetry</i></a>&#160;magazine.</p>
<p>Mackey taught at UC Santa Cruz for 31 years.</p>
<p>A poet, literary critic, fiction writer, and journal editor, he has produced a wide variety of work over the past three decades that earned him national and international recognition.</p>
<p>In 2006, Mackey was honored with a National Book Award in the poetry category for his book <em>Splay Anthem</em>. In 2010, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for poetry.</p>
<p>Mackey received a Whiting Writer's Award in 1993, and he was elected to the Board of Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets in 2001, one of the highest honors in the field of poetry.</p>
<p>Mackey&#8217;s books of poetry include <em>Four for Trane</em>, <em>Septet for the End of Time</em>, <em>Outlantish</em>, and <em>Song of the Andoumboulou</em>, which are widely regarded as among the most innovative examples of contemporary American experimental writing.</p>
<p>For many years, Mackey also hosted a radio program on Santa Cruz public radio station KUSP, "Tanganyika Strut," which focused on African music throughout the world.</p>
<p>He has published several book-length installments of his ongoing prose work <i>From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate</i>--composed as letters written by a composer/multi-instrumentalist named N, a founding member of a fictional band known as the Mystic Horn Society.</p>

<p>A mysterious disease that causes sea stars to decay and fall apart within a few days became widespread along the U.S. West Coast late last year. First reported off the coast of Washington in June, the disease known as "sea star wasting syndrome" has now been observed as far north as southeast Alaska and as far south as Orange County, California.</p>
<p>The Pacific Rocky Intertidal Monitoring Program, led by Pete Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology, has been documenting the disease at the group's long-term monitoring sites along the West Coast and collecting reports from other scientists and citizens.</p>
<p>Raimondi said citizens can help by reporting observations of the disease on his group's <a href="http://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/pacificrockyintertidal/data-products/sea-star-wasting/">Sea Star Wasting Syndrome web site</a>.</p>

<p>Designing a computer game is a lot like a relationship, says Lauren Scott, a 21-year-old UC Santa Cruz student majoring in computer science and business management economics.</p>
<p>First, there's the honeymoon phase when the idea seems perfect in every way. That's followed by the rocky stage where code starts to get unwieldy and bugs emerge.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the phase where the designer watches people have fun while playing her game.</p>
<p>That kind of risk and reward is part of what keeps Scott in a field she describes not only as a vehicle for technological change but for cultural change, as well.</p>
<p>Scott and two other students designed a puzzle-style computer game they called <i>Half/Way</i>. She also worked on UCSC's social simulation game <i>Prom Week</i> and designed an economics-centered game for Sifteo cubes named <i>Investio</i>, among other projects.</p>

<p>A research team led by Yat Li, associate professor of chemistry, developed the solar-microbial device and reported their results in a paper published in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Nano. The hybrid device combines a microbial fuel cell (MFC) and a type of solar cell called a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC).</p>
<p>In the MFC component, bacteria degrade organic matter in the wastewater, generating electricity in the process. The biologically generated electricity is delivered to the PEC component to assist the solar-powered splitting of water (electrolysis) that generates hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p>The island was home to a mysterious seabird known as a black-vented shearwater, a bird that haunted the night, nested in underground burrows, and could dive to depths of more than 100 feet in the ocean. Ninety-five percent of the entire species bred on that tiny island.</p>
<p>The problem was, the shearwaters, whose eerie nighttime cries sound like a cross between a coyote and a rooster, were disappearing. During the critical breeding season, feral cats, brought to the island to rid fishermen's houses of native deer mice, were killing 1,000 birds each month.</p>
<p>A prot&#233;g&#233; of two maverick UCSC biologists, Don Croll and Bernie Tershy, who had cobbled together a plucky, seat-of-thepants conservation team that saved threatened species by clearing islands of invasive predators, Keitt got to work.</p>
<p>Headquartered in a plywood shed behind the village market, Keitt studied the shearwaters by night and served as a cheerleader for the bird by day. Keitt took school children on field trips, told fishermen of the birds' amazing abilities, and drove home the fact that this enigmatic bird was their bird, found almost nowhere else on Earth.</p>
<p>Within three years, villagers had adopted the shearwater as their island mascot and were asking Keitt to help them get rid of the marauding felines.</p>
<p>The following year, not only did the Mexican government outlaw cats on Isla Natividad, but all the wild felines had been removed.</p>
<p>Shearwater mortality dropped to less than 100 per month.</p>
<p>Today, Keitt, 45, is director of conservation for a $6.5-milliona- year nonprofit called Island Conservation, which grew out of Croll and Tershy's work.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, the Santa-Cruz based organization has eradicated rats from Anacapa Island, allowing the number of Scripps's Murrelet nests to increase four-fold; removed packs of voracious goats that had turned the once-lush Guadalupe Island in Mexico into a near moonscape; and rid Allen Cay in the Bahamas of invasive mice, which were contributing to the destruction of native shearwaters and iguana habitat. In all, the organization reports it has saved 389 species from possible extinction on 52 islands around the world.</p>
<p>"It's incredibly rewarding," said Keitt of the work he has been doing for the past 18 years. "I feel lucky to have a job where I am making a difference that is so immediate yet lasting."</p>
<h3>Science into action</h3>
<p>Islands make up only 5 percent of the world's landmass, but they are home to 20 percent of all bird, reptile, and plant species. And nowhere are extinctions greater.</p>
<p>Ninety-five percent of bird species that have gone extinct once lived on islands, along with 80 percent of extinct reptiles and 55 percent of extinct mammals. Combined with the fact the pace of extinctions is ramping up worldwide, the importance of preserving island species becomes apparent.</p>
<p>Those facts were not lost on Tershy and Croll, a pair of scientists, surfers, and self-professed seabird freaks, who, 20 years ago&#8212;right about the time they began as UCSC research biologists&#8212;started their own two-man crusade to rid invasive species from islands in Baja California.</p>
<p>"These were projects we were doing in our spare time," said Tershy, a youthful-looking 52-year-old. "We were gentleman conservationists."</p>
<p>Inspired by conservation work in New Zealand and by ornithologist Kenneth Stager&#8212;who, in 1958, arrived on Clipperton Island with a shotgun and single-handedly wiped out a pack of feral pigs that was decimating the island's land crabs and seagoing albatrosses&#8212;Croll and Tershy grabbed their surfboards and traveled to a pair of wind-wracked Mexican islands. There, feral cats were obliterating Cassin's Auklets, Scripps's Murrelets and Black Storm-Petrels.</p>
<p>"We can do this," Tershy remembered saying to Croll.</p>
<p>With the help of a legendary California bobcat trapper, the scruffy, underfinanced environmental tacticians managed to clear the islands of the destructive felines, allowing native bird populations to rebound.</p>
<p>Within five years, the two had assembled a rag-tag team of grad students, trappers, and Mexican conservationists, freeing nine islands off Baja California of invasive rats, feral cats, rabbits, goats, and burros. They called themselves Island Conservation and Ecology Group and established a formal working relationship between UCSC and their budding nonprofit.</p>
<p>That idea of science as a foundation for action was fueled, they said, by two legendary UCSC professors: Ken Norris, renowned marine-mammal researcher and founder of Long Marine Lab (<a href="rev-spring-14-campaign-update.xml">read about a gift honoring the legacy of Ken Norris</a>), and Michael Soul&#233;, who was chairman of UCSC's Environmental Studies Department and known as the father of conservation biology.</p>
<p>One day, they said, Soul&#233; proposed this question: What if you could remove all the invasive species from the world's islands? That mind-blowing concept formed the basis for Island Conservation's model of research, conservation action, and result.</p>
<p>"To us it was: Why apply science just to describe problems?" said Croll, a flip-flop-wearing 56-year-old. "Using science to find solutions seemed way more interesting."</p>
<h3>Global reach</h3>
<p>Island Conservation's headquarters sits in an unassuming office building not far from the Pacific Ocean. Its 35 employees, however, range around the globe: from Hawaii to the Caribbean, from the Galapagos to Australia.</p>
<p>They gather scientific data, work with local governments and island residents, secure permits, enlist the help of other conservation organizations, and orchestrate removal of invasive vertebrates. They also contract with independent researchers to evaluate which species recover, and how well, after eradications are complete.</p>
<p>One such project got underway on a remote Aleutian landmass called Rat Island. There, a UCSC study found, shipwrecked Norwegian rats were killing nesting seabirds and small land birds, causing a chain-reaction of ecological destruction. Without seabirds eating snails, limpets, and other grazers, the intertidal zone was being stripped bare of seaweed. Island Conservation, along with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy, undertook a rat eradication in 2008 and today, according to Croll, researchers have documented the return of four bird species and an increase in avian populations overall.</p>
<p>But projects are not always problem-free. On Rat Island, bald eagles died after coming from other islands and feeding on poisoned rats. And when Island Conservation, working with the Channel Islands National Park and others, began efforts to rid Anacapa of its rodents, animal rights activists filed a lawsuit. Some called the use of poison cruel.</p>
<p>Keitt of Island Conservation understands the gut reaction to animal deaths, and said Island Conservation is committed to the humane treatment of native and invasive animals in its research and conservation work. But, he noted, "If we don't do what we do, we are losing entire species forever."</p>
<p>And the destruction of native species by invasive vertebrates is no less cruel than getting rid of already abundant animals, according to Croll, who pointed to a video of mice literally eating a fluffy albatross chick alive.</p>
<p>"It's not any of these introduced species' fault that they're on these islands&#8212;in many ways, it's humans' fault," Croll said, "but that doesn't mean it's OK to let the destruction happen."</p>
<p>Island Conservation's successes far outweigh its disappointments, however, and subsequent research by UCSC has found that the bald eagle population has recovered on Rat Island, which has been officially rechristened Hawadax, its traditional Aleut name. And, saving species, even one at a time, helps protect biodiversity, which, in turn, allows our delicately balanced ecosystem to continue to function.</p>
<p>While Tershy and Croll have moved on to other projects, UCSC still has a strong presence in the organization. Internships are offered to undergraduates, and grad students do research projects in collaboration with the group. Five of Island Conservation's 35 employees are UCSC alumni, including David Will, who graduated in 2008 with a degree in bioinformatics.</p>
<p>Not only has Will taken part in eradication projects, once sleeping for months in a shipping container welded to the deck of a heaving ship, but he is also now working on an Island Conservation database project to prioritize the world's 465,000 islands for conservation efforts.</p>
<p>Started by graduate student Dena Spatz in Tershy and Croll's Coastal Conservation Action Lab, the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database is now an elegant, searchable map (at tib.islandconservation.org) that allows a user to click on islands around the globe and discover which threatened and invasive species live there. Some 20 UCSC students gathered data for the project.</p>
<h3>From bare to lush</h3>
<p>Ask Keitt about Island Conservation's most visible success and he'll point to Isla Guadalupe, a 100-square mile, volcanic island 150 miles off Baja.</p>
<p>Once a lush paradise of pine and cypress forests, seal hunters arriving in the late 1800s brought goats to the island for food. By the time Island Conservation arrived, thousands of cloven-hooved foragers had turned the island into a near wasteland. Native plants were mowed into oblivion, birds struggled to survive, and only about 200 pine trees had survived the goats' onslaught.</p>
<p>With the help of local laborers, Keitt erected fences around a dozen small plots of land. Within six months, non-native grasses were growing inside the enclosures, but so too were pine seedlings and native species that hadn't been seen in years.</p>
<p>Armed with evidence of what was possible, Island Conservation and its Mexican counterpart, Conservaci&#243;n de Islas, received government support to remove the caprine invaders. Today, the island is home to about 10,000 new cypress and pine trees, along with island snapdragons and Guadalupe fan palms.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Mexican government declared the area a protected biosphere reserve.</p>
<p>Sitting in his office, dotted with bird drawings and photos from Island Conservation projects, Keitt said he has a dream.</p>
<p>"I dream about someday taking my kids to some of the islands where I worked and saying, 'I remember when there were no birds or trees here, and now look at it: It's thriving,'" he said.</p>
<p>"I hope they'll appreciate that."</p>

She does her work quietly, efficiently,&#160; and behind the scenes. <br/><br/>Claxton, UCSC&#8217;s associate registrar, is as far from a self-publicizer as you can get. It is difficult to find any biographical information on her online, or even a photograph, unless you count the one that appears alongside this story.</p>
<p>But Claxton&#8217;s public profile is just about to get a little bigger. Claxton, this year&#8217;s UCSC Alumni Association Outstanding Staff Award honoree, takes on "unimaginably gargantuan tasks," according to co-workers who nominated her for the award. One of her colleagues stated, flat out, that she hopes Claxton stays at UCSC forever: &#8220;I sincerely worry about what will happen when she decides to retire.&#8221; <br/><br/>Other staff members will have a chance to congratulate her on Tuesday, May 20, during the annual Staff Appreciation Picnic, which will coincide this year with the UC Walks fitness event. UCSC Wellness and the Staff Advisory Board (SAB) are presenting the event. Those who attend can take a "wellness break" and walk 30 minutes with co-workers, and then enjoy a picnic in appreciation of UCSC staff. Special guests will include UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal and Sammy the Slug. The event runs from 11 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. on OPERS East Field. <br/><br/>Claxton has been on campus for 15 years. She helps produce the UCSC General Catalog and Schedule of Classes and ensures that courses and programs are approved and available for students. She works closely with faculty, staff, and the UCSC Academic Senate. <br/>&#160;<br/>She deals with daunting challenges every week, including a perennial shortage of classrooms. During sections of the day that professors consider &#8220;prime time,&#8221; several different classes can vie for the same room. In such situations, Claxton helps coordinate, and tries to facilitate room swaps when necessary. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like there are extra rooms that stay empty,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;Our largest classrooms get booked all day long and into the evening.&#8221;<br/>&#160;<br/>She admits that she feels the pressure sometimes, &#8220;but I try and maintain a sense of humor.&#8221;<br/>&#160;<br/>Claxton fits in comfortably in Santa Cruz. While she might seem like a born-and-raised Santa Cruzan, Claxton is from the other side of the country. She grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, the youngest of seven children. After graduating from Tufts University with a B.A. in History, she moved to Austin, Texas as a VISTA volunteer working as a paralegal at Legal Aid. There she met her husband Ed who was and still is an acoustic guitar maker. From Austin they moved to Galveston, Texas, where they were both employed by the Galveston Historical Foundation. Their next move was to Maine. After 12 long winters, they decided to move to Santa Cruz, where they are enjoying life with their eight-year old golden retriever.<br/>&#160;<br/>Co-workers give her especially high marks for her listening and organizational skills,&#160; and for her grasp of the idiosyncrasies of programs and courses. One of them wrote this observation: &#8220;Somehow, magically, the thousands of students arrive and sit in thousands of seats during the first day of class every single quarter and I really think she is the one who makes it happen. Undergraduate students will never know her name but she is the one to thoughtfully assign (a professor&#8217;s) sections between two lectures and before the Friday when quizzes will be given.&#8221;<br/>&#160;<br/>"I enjoy working with faculty and staff,&#8221; Claxtn said. She has an intimate knowledge of the student information system software the campus uses to set up classes and enroll students and she understands the course and program approval process. <br/>&#160;<br/>Often, faculty and staff will call her and ask how to get a course or a program approved. Her work is important, she said, because she helps ensure that classes are available, helping UCSC to retain and graduate students, making sure they get the classes that they need and have majors they can thrive in. <br/>&#160;<br/>&#8220;And&#160; it isn&#8217;t just me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I work with a hard-working group of staff members in the Registrar&#8217;s Office who are always willing to help students, faculty, and staff. I am also so impressed by the dedication of faculty and staff and advisers on campus.&#8221;<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f206e056807270466ee00ed0996769f9"><name>symposium-awards</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Awards recognize top presentations at Graduate Research Symposium</title><summary>Graduate students from all divisions shared their research at the 10th Annual Graduate Research Symposium.</summary><keywords>Tyrus Miller, Graduate Research Symposium, graduate student research</keywords><start-date>1399878000000</start-date><display-name>Awards recognize top presentations at Graduate Research Symposium</display-name><path>/2014/05/symposium-awards</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/symposium-awards</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1399924908072</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400178525781</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/rachel-doran-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/rachel-doran-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rachel-doran-300.jpg</name><display-name>rachel-doran-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>86716</file-size><width>300</width><height>329</height></image><image-alt>Rachel Doran</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/rachel-doran-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/rachel-doran-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rachel-doran-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>rachel-doran-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30692</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rachel Doran</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Rachel Doran, winner of the Chancellor's Award at the Graduate Research Symposium.

<p>Though thousands of miles and two cultures apart, the students shared a connection. They were all beneficiaries of a microgrant supplied by a group of UC Santa Cruz alumni who were so inspired by a single class they shared in 1975, they've spent the last 20-plus years funding environmental and social projects around the world.</p>
<p>The men have helped bring hydroelectric power to an isolated village of 50 homes in Bali. They've funded the installation of toilets and drinking fountains at a rural elementary school in Sikkim, India, and supported the education of the first female lawyer from the U'wa tribe in Colombia, whose way of life in the cloud forest is being threatened by oil companies.</p>
<p>So far, the men estimate, they've handed out more than $180,000, most of it in amounts that range from $100 to $2,500, and the majority of it from their own pockets.</p>
<p>They do it out of a social consciousness for what they have and what others need, they say, and also as a way to keep their college friendship alive. It's grassroots philanthropy at its best, drops of kindness that have turned into a stream of good works.</p>
<h3>Inspired to act</h3>
<p>The Vietnam War had just ended when eight guys walked into a UCSC class titled The Political Economy of Ecological Problems led by a vibrant young professor named Claudia Carr, who now teaches at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Carr was what Dean Alper (College Eight '77, environmental studies and humanistic psychology), now a litigation attorney in Marin County, described as a "dynamic dervish of a teacher." Gesturing energetically, filling blackboards with notes, and handing out reading lists that ranged from ecologist Garrett Hardin's "Tragedy of the Commons" to works by free-market economist Milton Friedman, she insisted students not only challenge themselves but also injustice.</p>
<p>"Claudia instilled in us a social conscience," said Skye Leone (Cowell '77, environmental planning), now a senior recreation supervisor for UCSC's Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports (OPERS). "She walked her talk. She was a social activist."</p>
<p>It wasn't long before the eight guys in the class&#8212;Alper, Leone, Michael Freund, John Razz Cohn, Eric Dazey, Ken Hart, David Paul, and Glen Price&#8212;were hanging out.</p>
<p>The men, who all loved the outdoors, scattered after graduation&#8212; some of them going to law school, others working as guides or for a nonprofit in Asia&#8212;but they stayed in touch. In 1991, they decided to form a foundation as a way to ensure they got together at least once a year. They named themselves <a href="http://friendsfoundationinternational.org">Friends Foundation International</a>, and their first grant helped UCSC students build a pond designed to protect the threatened California red-legged frog.</p>
<p>It wasn't long, however, before the group's projects spread beyond Santa Cruz. Their grants began to reach people in Nepal, China, Africa, South America, and Indonesia&#8212;20 countries in all.</p>
<p>The amounts were never earthshaking but, the men said, they made sure the grants were life-changing.</p>
<p>"What we didn't want to do was fund studies or office overhead or public relations campaigns," said Alper. "Rather, we wanted to help people who were rolling up their sleeves and doing work in communities and solving real-world problems."</p>
<p>For some projects, that meant starting a ripple of funding that would spread beyond the organization's first small grant. Or, as Leone explained: "It's so they can say to other organizations, 'The Friends Foundation gave us $2,500 and here's what we did&#8212; how about giving us $10,000?'"</p>
<p>Other projects were more direct. A medical clinic in Panama received $600 so it could keep its medicines cold. A ranger in Costa Rica got a video camera so he could document poaching activity. Lights flickered on in a remote village in Bali where intrepid farmers raised fish in flooded rice paddies but didn't have money for a hydroelectric system. Clean water arrived at a village in Kenya.</p>
<p>"It's not the great white father swooping in and saying, 'I know the solution,'" Leone said. "It's, 'Here's some money and go do something with it.'"</p>
<p>"What we are very successful at," says Freund (College Eight '77, environmental studies and politics), now an environmental attorney in Berkeley, "is identifying projects in which a small amount of money has a large impact in protecting the environment, helping a village, or protecting public health."</p>
<h3>The company of friends</h3>
<p>The entire headquarters for Friends Foundation International is contained in a file cabinet in Freund's law office. There are no formal grant applications, no support staff. Instead, projects roll in from group members' travels, from legal connections, or from friends.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, for instance, Julie Kimball, a colleague of Leone's who teaches yoga and swimming for OPERS at UCSC, returned from a trip to Garm, Tajikistan. Considered one of the poorest Central Asia republics, the country lies on the Silk Road, with Afghanistan to the south and China to the east. Many residents of Garm grow their own food, have no indoor plumbing, and struggle to find jobs.</p>
<p>One woman, Rajabalieva Matluba, set out to change things and started building a community/women's center where girls could learn job skills and women could get help protecting their legal rights. As things go in an area where there is unrest, unemployment, and little government help, by the time Kimball arrived, the half-done project had run out of money.</p>
<p>Friends Foundation International sent off $2,500, which was enough to buy the lumber needed to complete the center's second floor. In a letter accompanied by photos of the center, Matluba said 15 girls trained there had recently found jobs.</p>
<p>The men tell stories of treks in Nepal and India, which, among other things, helped inspire them to fund a group in Katmandu called Pro Public, which uses litigation to fight against pollution of land, water, and air. They talk of riding up the remote Cuyabeno River in motorized dugouts to see for themselves the work of a legal group, Corporacion de Defensa de la Vida, which they fund and which is working to help indigenous people in Ecuador's remote Amazon River basin gain legal title to their land and create rainforest reserves in areas affected by oil and mining companies.</p>
<p>They talk about the connections and relationships they've developed around the world. They describe how fulfilling it is to see pictures of solar panels they funded, of little H'mong kids in Vietnam wearing warm clothes.</p>
<p>"The obvious answer to why we do this is because it feels good," Leone said. "But what I didn't expect was the gratitude that people express in receiving this help from strangers halfway around the world. That's what gives me the most satisfaction."</p>
<p>Decades later, the group has diversified, with three women now on the board, including professor Carr. And while the organization recently started holding a once-a-year fundraiser, Friends Foundation is not much different than when it began: a small group of friends, driven by a social conscience to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>"This is the glue that solidifies our connection to each other," Freund said.</p>
<h3>Big bang, small bucks</h3>
<p>On a cold day along the rocky Central Coast of California, 22-year-old UCSC researcher Sarah Sampson dipped her fingers into the icy water of the Pacific in search of baby mussels.</p>
<p>Her goal was to identify algae and substrates that might attract and support California mussels, a foundational species that helps restore intertidal zones after damage from oil spills.</p>
<p>It was one more example of Friends Foundation International at work&#8212;although this project was closer to home.</p>
<p>Inspired by another teacher&#8212; the late Richard Cooley, the charismatic founder of UCSC's environmental studies program and a gifted teacher whose work on conservation issues in Alaska has been widely recognized&#8212; the men set aside $2,400 in 1996 to start the Richard A. Cooley Memorial Endowment at UCSC.</p>
<p>The endowment, which has since grown to about $46,000, supports field projects like Sampson's, which result in tangible, positive action for the betterment of the environment.</p>
<p>Her work, which not only helped lay the groundwork for more research into intertidal restoration but also fueled her love of field research, was another example of a small action leading to a greater result.</p>
<p>"We live in a place of great privilege, and to do nothing with that is, well, in Claudia's words, 'not acceptable,'" Leone said.</p>

He's unmistakable, with his flame-colored hair, on-stage dance moves, and reedy voice.</p>
<p>In the decade since graduating, he's traveled from the halls of Kresge College to Carnegie Hall, the Bonnaroo camping festival, and the Late Show with David Letterman. He's gotten the chance to hone his craft, traveling with musicians like Dave Matthews and Jason Mraz, but UC Santa Cruz left him with perhaps an even more important gift&#8212;something to write about.</p>
<p><iframe align="right" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/114791145" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe>UCSC's community studies program left an indelible stamp on the lanky, six-foot-four, bespectacled Dennen, who looks younger than his 34 years.</p>
<p>"I came from a sheltered environment, not a diverse town&#8212;a little cowboy town in the valley," Dennen said in a phone interview from Venice Beach, where he rested before playing a cruiseship festival from Miami to Grand Cayman featuring the band Train.</p>
<p>Raised in Oakdale, California (Stanislaus County), he enjoyed being home-schooled but had a jarring experience in high school, which he calls a "failure factory" in a new song, "When We Were Young." UCSC was a much more nurturing environment.</p>
<p>"Santa Cruz is where I first started making friends with people who were very different from me, and the first place where I studied social issues in school, because I had never really lived them," Dennen said.</p>
<p>Dennen, now touring to support his album, <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i>, spoke of "mind-blowing classes" taught by community studies lecturer Mike Rotkin, and David Wellman, now a professor emeritus in the Social Sciences Division.</p>
<p>Rotkin remembers Dennen as "a really good student who understands the importance of art and culture to get people to think critically. And he performed a song in one of my classes."</p>
<p>UCSC's influence shows up in Dennen's best-known songs, including the haunting "Ain't No Reason," in which Dennen takes on apathy and social injustice: "Keep on building prisons, gonna fill them all. Keep on building bombs, gonna drop them all." At UCSC he also began to get more comfortable singing live and finding his voice.</p>
<p>"I'm still pretty shy," he said, "but being up on stage forces me to let my colors out. I have a creative side that needs to be nurtured in a protective environment, and an extroverted side, that comes out in full force. People pay a lot of freaking money to go to shows. I want to be myself and have a good time. I just want the audience to have fun."</p>
<p>Becoming a Slug was all but inevitable for Dennen, who divides his time between Los Angeles and Stanislaus County. His brother, sister, and three cousins all attended UCSC.</p>
<p>Now he wonders what might have happened if he'd gone to a different school and studied in a different program.</p>
<p>"Had I gone to an art school and just studied painting," said Dennen, "I don't know if I would have been able to really articulate the thoughts and feelings I was having about becoming a man and trying to make sense of my place in the world and all the injustice and beautiful and sad things happening all around."&#160;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/brett-dennen-295.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/brett-dennen-295.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brett-dennen-295.jpg</name><display-name>brett-dennen-295.jpg</display-name><file-size>15331</file-size><width>295</width><height>120</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Brett Dennen</thumb-alt><title>Brett Dennen</title><description>'Santa Cruz is where I first started making friends with people who were very different from me, and the first place where I studied social issues in school.'</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f62e8d39807270466ee00ed0815daafb"><name>coral-reefs</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Coral reefs provide valuable protection for coastlines</title><summary>A new study shows that coral reefs offer cost-effective protection from coastal storms, flooding, and rising sea levels.</summary><keywords>Michael Beck, Mike Beck, coral reefs, The Nature Conservancy</keywords><start-date>1399964400000</start-date><display-name>Coral reefs provide valuable protection for coastlines</display-name><path>/2014/05/coral-reefs</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/coral-reefs</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1399994617108</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400610278531</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/coral-reef-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/coral-reef-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-reef-400.jpg</name><display-name>coral-reef-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>84112</file-size><width>400</width><height>260</height></image><image-alt>coral reef</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/coral-reef-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/coral-reef-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>coral-reef-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>coral-reef-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22424</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>coral reef</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Coral reefs, such as this one in Micronesia, dissipate wave energy and can protect shorelines from storm damage.

(Photo courtesy of TNC)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Growing natural hazards from coastal storms, flooding, and rising sea levels are leading to major investments worldwide in coastal defense structures such as seawalls and breakwaters. A new study shows that coral reefs can provide risk reduction benefits comparable to artificial defenses, and reef restoration and enhancement is a cost-effective alternative to manmade structures.</p>
<p>The study, published May 13 in <i>Nature Communications,</i> was co-led by Michael Beck, lead marine scientist for the Nature Conservancy and a research associate at the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"We show that reefs can be particularly cost-effective as a first line of defense in comparison to artificial structures," Beck said. "We now have solid numbers to show just how important reefs are in reduction of wave energy. This is an issue that matters to hundreds of millions of people."</p>
<p>The researchers performed a systematic search of the scientific literature and analyzed published data on the contributions of coral reefs to risk reduction. The combined results showed that coral reefs dissipate 97 percent of the wave energy that would otherwise impact shorelines. Wave energy is a key factor in storm damage and coastal erosion. The researchers also found that most of the wave energy (86 percent) is attenuated by the reef crest, an important finding for guiding reef restoration efforts, Beck said.</p>
<p>Coral reefs face many threats--such as climate change, ocean acidification, coastal development, and destructive fishing practices--but Beck said there is still cause for optimism.</p>
<p>"People forget that coral reefs currently are in better shape than any other coastal habitat. We've lost more of our oyster reefs, marshes, and mangroves, so there's still a lot of coral reef habitat to work with," he said. "It's time to start taking action to preserve and restore this first line of defense for coastal hazard reduction."</p>
<p>The researchers estimated that there are nearly 200 million people living in coastal areas where they may benefit from the protection afforded by coral reefs, or bear the cost if reefs are lost or degraded.</p>
<p>Beck is currently working with a UCSC postdoctoral researcher, coastal engineer Borja Reguero, on a joint TNC-UCSC effort to design a coral reef restoration project for coastal defense in Grenada.</p>
<p>"We can do things to rebuild the structure of a reef and help kick-start the growing of living corals on top. We think that can be a particularly cost-effective approach for rebuilding this first line of defense," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Beck, the coauthors of the paper include Filippo Ferrario and Laura Airoldi from the University of Bologna; Curt Storlazzi at the USGS Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center (also a research associate at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences); Fiorenza Micheli at Hopkins Marine Station; and Christine Shepard from UCSC.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f6f854f5807270466ee00ed074ec4495"><name>voluntary-disability-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Invitation for Voluntary Disability Survey</title><summary>As a friendly reminder, if you have not already done so, please take a moment to complete the one-question voluntary survey emailed to all UC staff and academic employees on or around April 3rd, from the following sender UC_Disability_Survey@vres.us.</summary><start-date>1399964400000</start-date><display-name>Invitation for Voluntary Disability Survey</display-name><path>/2014/05/voluntary-disability-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/voluntary-disability-survey</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1400007840968</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400007840968</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">As a friendly reminder, if you have not already done so, please take a moment to complete the one-question voluntary survey emailed to all UC staff and academic employees on or around April 3rd, from the following sender <a href="mailto:UC_Disability_Survey@vres.us">UC_Disability_Survey@vres.us</a>.

The room held only a mini-fridge, a twin mattress, and an alarm clock. Her father, an electrician who often worked seven days a week, slept in a blanket on the floor.</p>
<p>Vargas was 17 then, and living through one of the hardest times in her life. She had been diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, an aggressive cancer that generally affects young people, and it had forced the removal and reconstruction of four of her ribs. But doctors told Vargas unless she had chemotherapy, the cancer might come back.</p>
<p>So Vargas, who was born in Los Angeles, and her father, a naturalized U.S. citizen, left their family behind in Tijuana, Mexico, and moved to San Diego for her treatments.</p>
<p>The $100-a-month garage was all they could afford.</p>
<p>At 25, Vargas is now cancer-free, but the lesson she learned from that time, she says, is what helped guide her into her current work. Today, Vargas is a suicide crisis line program coordinator for Suicide Prevention Services, where 400-500 lonely, lost, or suicidal people call in for help every month.</p>
<p>"I am really lucky to be alive," says Vargas (Kresge '12, Latin American and Latino studies, literature), "but not everyone thinks that, or they feel their life is hopeless. I want to help them recognize a little bit of that hope."</p>
<p>Vargas's life has mostly been an uphill climb. She was a shy girl whose cancer made her even more introverted. In order to support herself while attending San Diego City College, she worked 20-40 hours a week at the county's animal shelter. At UCSC, she received a few grants, got loans, and held down two jobs in order to pay for her schooling.</p>
<p>But Vargas says there was a part of her that always wanted to give back to her community&#8212;although work and the cancer made that hard to do for a long time.</p>
<p>So when a job overseeing the 80 volunteers who staff Suicide Prevention's 24-hour crisis line opened, Vargas knew she had found her niche.</p>
<p>While the Centers for Disease Control estimates an average of 105 people a day die of suicide in the U.S., Vargas says she had her own brush with the experience. In college, a friend called and threatened to harm himself. Vargas spent eight frightening hours trying to convince him to live.</p>
<p>"It wasn't until later that I found out there were things like suicide hotlines," Vargas says. "If I had know that, I wouldn't have felt so alone."</p>
<p>Her work now consists of supporting volunteers who, like she did, help those struggling with hard times and thoughts of selfharm. She also arranges training sessions and does outreach in order to break the stigma and secrecy around suicide so more people can get help.</p>
<p>"I feel like I am definitely giving back to the community that educated me," Vargas says.</p>
<p>Her supervisor, Assistant Program Director Rosalina Valdez, calls Vargas hard-working, resilient, and determined.</p>
<p>"With everything she has gone through and at her age," Valdez says, "there is a sense of responsibility, maturity, and a zest for life that is incredibly impressive to me."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f726c6ba807270466ee00ed05f72b206"><name>rev-spring-14-alumneye</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumneye  </title><summary>With the spring 2014 issue of UC Santa Cruz Review magazine, we started a new alumni photo submission feature to highlight and celebrate the experiences, travels, and artistic insights of UCSC's diverse and fascinating alumni.</summary><start-date>1399964400000</start-date><display-name>Alumneye  </display-name><path>/2014/05/rev-spring-14-alumneye</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/rev-spring-14-alumneye</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1400010884746</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400010966486</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>With the spring 2014 issue of <em>UC Santa Cruz Review</em> magazine, we started a new alumni photo submission feature to highlight and celebrate the experiences, travels, and artistic insights of UCSC's diverse and fascinating alumni.</p>

<p>"I explain that my parents didn't go to college, and that I'm relying on scholarships to go to UCSC," said Carella (Kresge '15, sociology). "I don't come from a lot of money, and being at UCSC is a blessing. I want people to know that."</p>
<p>Carella, part of the student philanthropic organization <a href="https://www.facebook.com/slug2slug">Slug to Slug</a>, is one of seven student fundraisers who stand in the plaza near the Bay Tree Bookstore rain or shine, clipboard in hand, asking for student donations. The job is fraught with rejection. Passersby often ignore her, and she's heard her share of "no."</p>
<p>But when students stop to talk, she engages them: "I tell them: I'm a student, I'm paying tuition, and we need to help each other out," Carella said.</p>
<p>Clearly, the message is getting across. About a third of the students who chat with a Slug to Slug student fundraiser end up making a donation and giving back.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, the Slug to Slug program works hard to instill a sense of "Slug Pride," while building a culture of philanthropy among students, educating them on the impact of private support, and teaching them the importance of staying connected and giving back after they graduate.</p>
<p>The organization believes in the principles of paying it forward, or the notion that "philanthropy is a positive feedback loop." Slug to Slug is different from other student philanthropy groups because it focuses on students supporting their own community, feeling gratitude, and making a conscious decision to support UCSC.</p>
<p>The fundraisers reach out to more than 1,200 students a week and accept donations of any amount. This school year, the students have raised about $3,000 toward undergraduate scholarships and programs on campus through more than 700 donors.</p>
<p>The organization blends generosity with fun. One of its main fundraisers is Slugfest, an annual benefit, and the biggest dance party on campus, with DJs, an appearance by Sammy the Slug himself, and more than 1,000 revelers supporting student scholarships.</p>
<p>Carella started her fundraising career in high school, where she designed and sold T-shirts to support her San Francisco charter school. Now she's building on those skills at Slug to Slug, which started out as a workstudy job. Now she co-manages the program with her friend and colleague, Hannah Klass (Kresge '15, sociology).</p>
<p>Klass also has a personal connection to the Undergraduate Scholarship Fund. She chose UCSC in part because of the financial aid she was offered there. "I don't receive a contribution from my family," she said. "I've worked two jobs for most of the time I've been at UCSC."</p>
<p>Klass runs education and outreach for the program, finding volunteers and representing Slug to Slug at community events.</p>
<p>"People say college students are broke and they won't give," said Klass, but she's learned to question this stereotype. Last year, she met a group of students at the plaza who said "hi" to her every day, but never donated. The last day of class, they walked over and handed her a $20 bill.</p>
<p>"So many students are ready to give. So many students on our campus are so supportive," said Klass. "Seeing that aspect of it has been amazing."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f74eedac807270466ee00ed006320859"><name>pacific-crest-trail-legend-sage-clegg-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Into the wilderness: Intrepid hiker, biologist blazes her own trail</title><summary>The 34-year-old UC Santa Cruz alum Sage Clegg is the first woman to complete the triple crown of long-distance, end-to-end trail hiking — hoofing 7,400 miles over the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Appalachian Trail — in only 18 months.</summary><start-date>1399964400000</start-date><review-date>1400012340000</review-date><display-name>Hiking legend Sage Clegg</display-name><path>/2014/05/pacific-crest-trail-legend-sage-clegg-ucsc</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/pacific-crest-trail-legend-sage-clegg-ucsc</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1400013516146</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400092830744</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/Sage Clegg One.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/Sage Clegg One.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Sage Clegg One.jpg</name><display-name>Sage Clegg One.jpg</display-name><file-size>37178</file-size><width>350</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/sage clegg thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/sage clegg thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>sage clegg thumb.jpg</name><display-name>sage clegg thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>13608</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sage Clegg gets up close and personal with a trailside reptile.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/Sage Clegg Two 350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/Sage Clegg Two 350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Sage Clegg Two 350.jpg</name><display-name>Sage Clegg Two 350.jpg</display-name><file-size>54922</file-size><width>261</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>Clegg takes a brief respite in between conquering yet another trail.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In the world of thru-hiking, Sage Clegg is something of a rock star.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old UC Santa Cruz alum was the first woman to complete the triple crown of long-distance, end-to-end trail hiking &#8212; hoofing 7,400 miles over the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail, and the Appalachian Trail &#8212; in the space of only 18 months.</p>
<p>She also was the first person to travel the rugged 800-mile Oregon Desert Trail, debuted her own 1,200-mile route across California, spent one entire nine-month period in the backcountry, and lived a nomadic life in her truck for close to seven years. On top of that, she often defied convention by traversing well-known hiking routes in the opposite direction of everyone else &#8212; from Canada to Mexico on the Pacific Crest Trail, for instance &#8212; and works as a wildlife biologist studying the desert tortoise.</p>
<p>She is a maverick in hiking boots, an always curious adventurer who sees the world through the lens of plants, animals, and landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just like being by myself in nature,&#8221; said Clegg (Merrill, &#8217;01, environmental studies). &#8220;I feel really comfortable walking on a trail. The rhythm, the outdoors &#8212; it&#8217;s something my soul needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raised in the wooded landscape of Willits, California, Clegg arrived at UCSC with the dream of getting a job with Outward Bound, an outdoor education program. Working for UCSC&#8217;s Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports, she honed her leadership skills and got her dream job.</p>
<p>But in 2008, when Outward Bound closed the base where she worked, the devastated Clegg decided to challenge herself by hiking the 700-mile Grand Enchantment Trail in America&#8217;s Southwest. She has since covered more than 10,000 miles by foot.</p>
<p>Traveling light with a pack that typically weighs only 20 pounds, usually on her own, and often covering 25-30 miles a day, Clegg has been stalked by a mountain lion, encountered nine rattlesnakes on a single day&#8217;s walk, and once hiked a parched 15 miles in 105-degree heat in search of drinkable water.</p>
<p>One of her mentors, OPERS Senior Recreation Supervisor Matt Brower (Crown, &#8217;91, environmental studies) described Clegg as a mentally and physically tough woman who is comfortable being by herself, highly organized, and able to problem solve in a calm and logical way.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big thing we do here (in OPERS) is encourage people to take appropriate risks and see mistakes as part of the learning process,&#8221; said Brower of Clegg. &#8220;Sage has obviously taken that to heart and has expanded her circle of comfort well beyond what most of us would consider normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking by phone from the Ivanpah Valley in Nevada where she is working as a wildlife biologist for a solar-power project, Clegg laughed and said she never set out to crack thru-hiking&#8217;s granite ceiling.</p>
<p>In July of 2009, she said, she embarked on the 2,654-mile Pacific Crest Trail, traveling north to south because of her work schedule and a desire to avoid crowds. After a hiatus to work in the Mojave with desert tortoises and earn some adventure money, she hit the 2,800-mile Continental Divide Trail, where the idea of completing all three of the U.S.&#8217;s major long-distance routes began to tickle her brain. She promised herself if she completed the CDT by August, she&#8217;d try the challenging 2,000-mile Appalachian Trial, traveling southbound in the fall. She finished that rugged Eastern U.S. hike on Dec. 24, 2010 &#8212; the first woman to bag all three trails in 18 months.</p>
<p>Part of the appeal of those long, lonely miles, &#8220;is that there is so much to be curious about,&#8221; Clegg said. &#8220;I get addicted to &#8216;what&#8217;s round the next bend?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also what sets her apart from many of her peers. As a biologist, she said, she finds the natural world she encounters on her 12-hour-a-day treks to be both entertainment and a comfort. She&#8217;ll observe birds and study insects the way people watch TV. &#8220;I&#8217;ll learn the name of a plant and see it and think &#8216;oh cool, there&#8217;s a friend,&#8217;&#8221; Clegg said.</p>
<p>Said her friend, Travis Burdick (Cowell, &#8217;01, literature and the environment) who works in Red Lodge, Montana, with survivors of domestic and sexual violence: &#8220;When Sage wants to learn or do something, she really does it. She's someone who takes her dreams and makes them come true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of Clegg&#8217;s stories would make a normal person head straight for a Holiday Inn &#8212; caught in an ice storm on the Appalachian Trail, Clegg awoke to find her wet jacket and boots were frozen solid &#8212; but the backcountry is a place where Clegg said she feels most at home.<br/><br/>There, her problems are difficult but simple &#8212; find water, don&#8217;t get lost, frighten off a stalking mountain lion &#8212; &#8220;and I know I have the resources to make it happen,&#8221; Clegg said. She feels confident.<br/><br/>In the &#8220;front country,&#8221; as she calls it, things like bills, car repairs, and the Internet leave her feeling distracted. &#8220;My confidence is kind of cloudy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see what I&#8217;m capable of.&#8221;<br/><br/>Her faith in humanity is also restored on the trail, according to Clegg, who told stories of a woman sheltering her during that ice storm, of a truck full of rough-looking hunters in a desolate wilderness who fished a baggie of blueberries and cherries out of their cooler and wished her luck on her hike.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be cool to figure out a way to bring that attitude out in people on a normal basis,&#8221; Clegg said.</p>
<p>Now a homeowner in Bend, Ore., Clegg confesses she misses some of the freedom she had between the ages of 25 and 33, when she spent more than 200 days outside each year and lived in her Tacoma truck. But she is also happy to be spending half the year working for her company, Fresh Tracks Consulting Inc., learning to do things like can vegetables, and setting down roots with her boyfriend Adam Drummer.</p>
<p>Still, her roots will probably always be surface deep.&#160; This summer, Clegg plans to hike the strenuous and largely unmarked Bigfoot Trail in Northern California, which boasts 32 species of conifers along its 400 miles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need to hike because I love it,&#8221; Clegg said. &#8220;It fuels me.&#8221;</p>

of his documentary film, <a href="http://vimeo.com/87056760"><em><strong>Walking Kids of Choco</strong></em></a>, at the 67h annual Cannes Film Festival.<br/><br/>One of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, the Cannes festival each year previews new films of all genres, by invitation only, at the Palais des Festivals et des Congr&#232;s.<br/><br/>Vargas&#8217;s 24-minute documentary spotlights the Kuna people, an indigenous community located in the middle of the Darien Gap tropical rain forest on the border between Colombia and Panama, who follow ancient Native American traditions.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the lives of the children who must walk to school for four hours daily to get educated in a different culture--exploring their motivation and how they deal with the complicated balance between tradition and modernity. <br/><br/>&#8220;I did the editing and the post-production process at UCSC,&#8221; noted Vargas. &#8220;At the beginning of the film, I talk about being in a film and digital media Ph.D program and how this influenced the way I conceived the story presented in the film. So UCSC is present behind the camera, but in front of it too, so to speak.&#8221; &#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Editing a film is a very complex process, especially because you lose the ability of seeing it with fresh eyes,&#8221; Vargas added. &#8220;I did the camera, the editing, and the research, so you have to understand that you lose objectivity at a certain point. I started working with Pardis Mehdizadegan, a fellow Ph.D Film student at the end of the fall quarter, and she became &#8216;my eyes&#8217; during the last editing phase. Her feedback was crucial to finishing the film.&#8221;<br/><br/>It took Vargas eight months to make the documentary, plus one year of research prior to shooting. But he found the filming process to be the most demanding part of the project.<br/><br/>&#8220;Being in a tropical rain forest without electricity brought many unexpected issues that must be resolved on a daily basis,&#8221; said Vargas. &#8220;Because I was mostly walking all day with film equipment, I lost 12 pounds during the shooting. It took me six months to gain them back.&#8221;<br/><br/>Vargas completed the documentary in February and is now in the initial promotional phase of the film. After France, he is off to Portugal, Brazil and Colombia for the next several months. But he is excited to start the tour at Cannes.<br/><br/>&#8220;I will be screening it to selected professionals during the week of May 19, and the film will be accessible to all festival spectators via a film library located at the Short Film corner,&#8221; said Vargas. <br/><br/>&#8220;I will be there for the whole festival,&#8221; he added. &#8220;They have tons of activities for filmmakers, and I have always enjoyed the sharp reading that Europeans in general do of my work. It is also a perfect festival for networking.&#8221;<br/><br/><em>Walking Kids of Choco</em> will additionally be screened on the UCSC campus on June 4, beginning at 7 p.m. in Studio C at the Communications Building. <br/><br/>Admission is free and the public is invited.</p>

Areas of distinction also emerged, including environment and sustainability, social justice, and diversity. <br/><br/>The discussion generated broad consensus on <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/vision-conference/GroupSharedVisions.pdf">major themes for the future</a>. Task force co-chairs Peggy Delaney, vice chancellor of Planning and Budget, and Lynn Westerkamp, professor of history, have incorporated all of this into a <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/vision-conference/draft-shared-vision.html">document</a> that is being reviewed by task force members. They invite your <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/UCSCVision">comments</a>. The task force will reconvene May 23, with campus leaders and key operational partners, to define and prioritize goals and develop action plans that will guide the campus over the next five years. We look forward to receiving that document and sharing our impressions and intentions with the campus by the end of Spring Quarter. <br/><br/>The inclusive nature of this process reflects our values at UC Santa Cruz and our dedication to our <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principles of Community</a>. Hundreds of stakeholders have contributed their ideas and opinions. That's an impressive accomplishment; we don't believe any previous campus planning effort has been this inclusive or transparent.<br/><br/>We are also grateful to external stakeholders who participated in the April meetings, including Santa Cruz City Councilmember Hilary Bryant, San Jose State President Mohammad Qayoumi, Willie Elliott-McCrea of Second Harvest Food Bank, Santa Cruz County Economic Development Coordinator Barbara Mason, and others.<br/><br/>Finally, we are struck by the common ground that has emerged: over and over, the same compelling ideas have risen to the top. Participants tell us they appreciate contributing to something substantive and positive, and we sense a collective desire to move this campus forward in meaningful and lasting ways. Thank you for being part of this ambitious, collaborative effort.<br/><br/>----</p>

<p>Brugge has been an innovator in cancer research since the beginning of her career, when she isolated the viral and cellular forms of the Src protein--the first retroviral oncogene product to be identified--as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado. Since then, she has continued to shape ideas and new techniques in the field of cancer biology. Her lab recently discovered a novel process called entosis, or cell death by invasion, in which a cell is enveloped by a neighboring cell. Such new discoveries promise fresh ways forward in the search for strategies to kill cancer cells.</p>
<p>Brugge has combined her academic research interests with significant accomplishments in the private sector, spending 5 years as the Scientific Director and Vice President for Research of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. She joined the faculty at Harvard Medical School in 1997. Brugge has received several awards recognizing her scientific accomplishments and has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of Medicine.</p>
<p>The Sinsheimer Distinguished Lectureship in Biology was established in 1992 by Chancellor emeritus Robert L. Sinsheimer and his wife, Karen. This lectureship is part of Sinsheimer's continuing relationship with UCSC. A pioneer of molecular biology, he was the fourth Chancellor of UCSC, ushering it through a critical decade of growth (1977-1987). Sinsheimer also hosted the 1985 "Santa Cruz Workshop," a meeting of internationally prominent scientists to consider the feasibility and desirability of sequencing the human genome.</p>

Cruz, a writer, educator, and community organizer who will speak on the need for immigration reform and the ways in which the United States is changing how we define who we are as Americans. <br/><br/>The convocation will take place Tuesday, May 20 from 7-9 p.m. at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. It is free and open to the public. <br/><br/>The Convocation honors the memory of Cesar Chavez, his achievements, commitment to social justice and civil rights, his unrelenting efforts to cultivate grassroots leadership, and his successful formation of the United Farm Workers Union (UFW).&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>The issue of undocumented immigrants is highly charged. Children who come to the U.S. at a young age and have lived in the country for most of their lives want to be recognized as Americans but do not possess the documentation of citizenship. <br/><br/>Cruz's life experience is a common story for thousands of students nationally and the more than 12 million immigrants in this country who are undocumented. &#160;<br/><br/>Born in Juchitl&#225;n, Jalisco, Mexico, he migrated to the U.S. at a young boy with his single mother and grandmother. He grew up in South Central Los Angeles and later moved to the Bay Area to study where he graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in history. Currently, he is a doctoral candidate at Harvard University in educational policy.<br/><br/>For the last 20 years, Cruz has been an educator who has sought to create alternative places for education. He co-founded the independent school &#8220;Making Changes&#8221; out of his home. For the last five years, he has overseen the Homies Empowerment Program, that serves youth in Oakland who are affected by or involved with gangs.<br/><br/>He is the author of two books, <em>Revenge of The Illegal Alien</em>, and <em>Bang for Freedom</em>. <br/><br/>Convocation organizers said Cruz was selected as this year's keynote speaker for his courageous efforts to step out of the shadows and lend a voice to the disenfranchised.<br/><br/>Past keynote speakers for the Cesar Chavez Convocation have been UFW co-founder Dolores Huerta (2004 and 2013); playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker and director, Luis Valdez (2005); United Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriquez (2006); executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, Maria Elena Durazo (2007); performance artist Guillermo G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a (2008), Kent Wong, director of the UCLA Labor Center (2009);&#160; Mar&#237;a Hinojosa, journalist, managing editor of Latino USA (2010); Father Gregory Boyle, executive director of Homeboy Industries (2011); Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Jose Antonio Vargas (2012).<br/><br/>The Cesar Chavez Convocation is presented by the College Ten Co-Curricular Programs and El Centro/Chicano Latino Resource Center, and co-sponsored by: Office of Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion, Office of the Dean of Students, Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion, Community and Resource Empowerment-(e2), Porter College Senate, Kresge College Senate, Crown College Senate, Merrill College Senate, Cowell College Senate, Stevenson College Senate, College Eight Senate, Oakes College Senate, Students Informing Now (SIN), Hermanos Unidos de UCSC, Women's Center, Lionel Cantu Queer Resource Center, American Indian Resource Center, Asian American Resource Center, African American Resource and Cultural Center<br/>&#160;

More importantly, she wanted to know how the propensity for gender-based violence against women might change. <br/><br/>Writing in the journal <em>Psychology of Women Quarterly</em>, Grabe suggests that when women in developing countries own land, they gain power within their relationships and are less likely to experience violence.<br/><br/>Grabe and co-authors Rose Grace Grose and Anjali Dutt, both UCSC psychology graduate students, analyzed data Grabe collected from 492 women in Nicaragua and Tanzania in 2007 and 2009 respectively. <br/><br/>"Women in both countries connected owning property to increased power and status within their communities and to having greater control within their relationships," the authors write. <br/><br/>Violence against women is not a matter of isolated cases but rather the result of systems of power, and it can change when the power relationship changes, Grabe found.</p>
<p><strong>Not just 'bad apples'</strong></p>
<p>"When we think about violence against women we often focus on isolated cases," Grabe said. "If we keep assuming the problem is a matter of a 'few bad apples' or 'fundamentalists' that we need to bring to justice we will never eradicate the problem." <br/><br/>"The findings suggest that if we shift the structures (thereby shifting views of women) it will also shift domestic relations which dramatically improve women's risk," she said.<br/><br/>Physical and psychological violence against women is a result of structural, gender-based inequalities such as the lack of access to resources, equal pay, and representation in politics, she said. "These inequalities grant men disproportionate power over women and as a result we see male control and dominance being exerted over women's bodies in the form of violence."</p>
<p><strong>Impact of globalization</strong></p>
<p>Other researchers have found that globalization is making the problem worse. In many regions of the developing world&#8212;what has been called the "Global South"&#8212;land is held in traditional ways, often communally or by male-dominated families. The term Global South is used, not as a geographical reference, but instead to reflect the socioeconomic and political divide between wealthy countries, known collectively as the North, and poorer countries often exploited in processes of globalization. <br/><br/>Financial models in the "North" such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank frequently require private land ownership as a prerequisite for economic aid. <br/><br/>"One of the consequences of the shift to privatized systems," researchers say, "is an erosion of the few rights to land that women previously held under customary or cooperative systems."<br/><br/>Grabe worked with grassroots organizations in both Nicaragua and Tanzania for her study. Though the situations were different, she found women in newly privatized areas are using land as a proxy of power. "Property grants them rights" and the women are very strategic about it, she said. "They knew that if they had land they'd change the power dynamic. They were very clear about the social inequity."</p>
<p><strong>Who has the rights?</strong></p>
<p>Previously, women would in effect grant rights to men. "Women would say, 'he has the rights, he owns the land, he owns the cattle,'" Grabe said.&#160; Those rights included a right to exert violence. Once a woman becomes a property owner she gains rights. <br/><br/>Grabe found that grassroots women's organizations are making a concerted effort to tackle the problem of violence against women by going to the root of the problem&#8211;structural inequality instead of intervening in individual cases with women who are targeted.<br/><br/>"In order to address rates of violence against women we need to address the structure of inequities," she said. <br/><br/>Grabe joined UCSC in 2008. She is also affiliated with the departments of feminist studies and Latin American and Latino studies. For spring quarter, she's teaching a senior seminar in psychology and social activism. <br/><br/>The article is "<a href="http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/06/0361684314533485">Women's Land Ownership and Relationship Power: A Mixed Methods Approach to Understanding Structural Inequities and Violence Against Women</a>" online in <em>Psychology of Women Quarterly</em>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/06/0361684314533485</url><title>'Women's Land Ownership and Relationship Power'</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="fca198f8807270466ee00ed0a834155f"><name>export-control-awareness</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Export Control Awareness</title><summary>Information to increase awareness about export control regulations.</summary><start-date>1400050800000</start-date><display-name>Export Control Awareness</display-name><path>/2014/05/export-control-awareness</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/export-control-awareness</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1400102820046</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400103266587</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This email is being sent to increase awareness about export control regulations.</p>

<p>Epps is a pioneer of astronomical optics whose designs have touched almost every major telescope in the world. Modern astronomy is "photon hungry" and depends on efficient optics to collect as much light as possible over a wide field of view. Epps is an expert in designing innovative optics that allow deep imaging surveys and spectroscopy of very faint targets. His work is invisible to many who use his optics, but it has facilitated the modern explosive growth of data in astronomy.</p>
<p>Epps has designed optics for several decades and continues to be extremely active with instruments currently on the Keck Telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii; the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona; the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile; the Gemini Telescopes in Hawaii and Chile; and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at the McDonald Observatory in Texas.

<div><span class="Apple-style-span" face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The new calendar includes a number of improvements:&#160;Its look and feel is now consistent with the current campus&#160;web environment,&#160;and events are easier to find by category type. The calendar has also been&#160;enhanced in some&#160;less visible ways: It has been developed on a more stable&#160;application and hardware platform, making future&#160;improvements possible.</span></div>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span" face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">While most areas on campus are already listing&#160;events in the new calendar, our hope is that all campus&#160;departments will&#160;participate. If your area of campus is not yet using the site to list events,&#160;please help us make this&#160;calendar comprehensive by&#160;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/account/">creating an account and adding your events</a>.</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">We will begin including the&#160;<a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/">events.ucsc.edu</a>&#160;web site on all&#160;general UC Santa Cruz marketing and communications&#160;materials.</span></div>

With more than 20 years of experience at UC Santa Cruz, most recently as Assistant Director of OSP, Kate brings a wealth of experiences, knowledge, and enthusiasm to this role.</p>
<p>As Director, Kate will oversee the grant and contract proposal submission process, the award negotiation and acceptance process, and the post-award and close-out processes, in addition to being responsible for administration of the office. &#160;The Office of Sponsored Projects is in the midst of revamping its current processes and implementing new software and third-party services to enhance the campus' research profile and services. &#160;Kate&#8217;s thorough knowledge of OSP's functions and deep understanding of the campus&#8217;s research administrative structure will provide leadership, continuity and the expertise needed to ensure a smooth transition at this critical juncture.</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming Kate to his new role. Kate can be reached directly at&#160;<a href="mailto:kmaja@ucsc.edu">kmaja@ucsc.edu</a> or x9-3341.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Larry Castro&#8217;s retirement as Director Of Office of Sponsored Projects. Many of you have worked with Larry during his 35 years on campus in roles spanning from Research Analyst in PBSci, OSP Contract and Grant Officer, Senior Internal Auditor, and Extramural Funds Manager. In addition, Larry implemented the FAST Office in Accounting and directed it for five years. In the short time, I have worked with Larry I have found him to be a principled and knowledgeable colleague, and I will miss his good counsel in various matters. Please join me in thanking Larry for his many years of valuable service to the campus and wishing him all the best in his retirement.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC

Exhibition at the Sesnon Gallery showcases some of UCSC&#8217;s most promising young artists.</p>
<p>The annual show spotlights award-winning students honored by <b>The William Hyde and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarship Fund</b>--established in 1986 to generate merit scholarships furthering the education of up-and-coming UCSC art students.</p>
<p>Recipients are chosen from a variety of areas in the Art Department, with each artist working in a different medium--ranging from painting and sculpture, to photography and digital media.</p>
<p>The 2014 Irwin Scholars show will run May 28 through June 14. An opening reception takes place on May 28, from 5 to 7 p.m., including the awards ceremony, which begins at 6 p.m. in the courtyard outside the gallery near the Koi pond.</p>
<p>Admission is free, and the pubic is invited.</p>
<p>"As we settle into the turn of the century, we must contemplate the speed of information, and how it affects our identity and quality of experience,&#8221; said Mark Shunney, assistant curator of the Sesnon Gallery.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current Irwin Scholars Exhibition represents a diversity of mediums and messages that speak to the next generation of artists confronted by this flattened landscape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This year, the Irwin Scholars ask visitors to evaluate their own assumptions about identity; their work promises to undercut stereotype and the control of media, and to take back the agency to define self through the art process,&#8221; Shunney added.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s 2014 Irwin Scholarship recipients are:</p>
<p><b>David Berry, Will Brady, Maytal Gotesman, Courtney Hanson, Eric Harrod, Sonja Holopainen,&#160;Joshua Hurwitz, Althea James, Jasen Levoy, Elliott Taylor, Stephanie Toro </b>and <b>Cary Wander</b>.</p>
<p>&#160;Sesnon Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, from noon to 5 p.m., and Wednesday until 8 p.m. Admission is free, and parking is free on Saturdays. Group tours are available by appointment.&#8232;&#8232;</p>

Kevin Abas, a graduate student in computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, used off-the-shelf components to build a prototype device for a solar-powered wireless network of smart cameras with potential applications in security systems and wildlife monitoring.</p>
<p>Abas described his system and reviewed similar designs developed by other researchers in a paper published as a cover feature in the May issue of the journal <i><a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/computer">Computer</a></i>, published by the <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/guest/home">IEEE Computer Society</a>.</p>
<p>"The on-board components are getting so much smaller and more computationally powerful, it's possible for a compact camera device to have a lot of data processing and other capabilities," Abas said.</p>
<p>Working with Katia Obraczka, professor of computer engineering at UCSC, Abas is designing a "Solar Wi-Fi Energy Efficient Tracking camera (SWEETcam) system," in which the camera nodes can cooperate to form a wireless network for transmitting and processing data. Each camera node is powered by a solar panel and a rechargeable battery. Using computer vision software, the system is able to analyze the images as they are captured.</p>
<p>"It has a motion sensor, so the cameras wouldn't be on all the time. And if it gets activated by something that is not of interest, the computer vision software can identify that and put the system back into sleep mode so it's not recording things like vegetation moving in the wind, or raccoons and deer," Abas said.</p>
<p>The primary motivation for the project came from considering the challenges of monitoring for public safety purposes in remote areas where traditional wired security systems are impractical. The researchers acknowledged that, while security cameras in stores are now commonplace, some people might find the idea of a network of smart cameras monitoring public spaces a bit too Orwellian. "It's always a trade-off. There are certainly privacy concerns, but if their security is at risk people may be willing to live with some compromises," Obraczka said.</p>
<p>Abas noted that SWEETcam could also be used by biologists for monitoring wildlife. "Researchers deploy motion-activated cameras to study animals like mountain lions, and my device could be perfect for that," he said.</p>
<p>A lot of effort went into power management to make the system as energy efficient as possible. "It has to be energy efficient to run on solar power, so making it smart in terms of how it uses power is one of the most interesting parts of the system," Obraczka said. "The balance between performance requirements and energy efficiency is what drives the design."</p>
<p>Based on the popular <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> platform--a low-cost single-board computer the size of a credit card--the prototype device has the computational power required for complex networking, power management, and image processing tasks. The image analysis capabilities were not a primary focus of the project, but could potentially be a very powerful feature of the system. For example, it could identify and tag certain "behaviors" in the images, Abas said.</p>
<p>"With most security systems, you only go back and look at the data after a crime has been reported, and then someone has to look through hours of video," he said. "In theory, we could tag certain images so that, for example, in a bike theft scenario, you could search for all the video where there's a person at the bike rack. You could also program it to send an alert for certain types of suspicious activity when it's happening."</p>
<p>Currently, however, the SWEETcam system has fairly limited image analysis capabilities. Caio Porto, a visiting student from Brazil, worked on this aspect of the project as a summer intern in Obraczka's lab last year. The main focus was on recognizing people and animals to avoid "false alerts" from the motion sensor.</p>
<p>"For now, we are not doing any sophisticated visual processing, just using standard open-source libraries," Obraczka said. "We're mostly interested in the networking and systems engineering aspect, but the computer vision part is certainly fascinating. The fact that you can do so much with so little is amazing, and a little scary at the same time."</p>
<p>Abas received a Chancellor's Graduate Internship Project grant from UCSC for this research, which was also supported by the National Science Foundation (grant CNS 1321151).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="15a6ef69807270461ae4b3b8c0d4321e"><name>erit-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal Review: Proposed Renewal of the Employee-initiated Reduction In Time (ERIT) Program</title><summary>The University is proposing to renew the Employee-initiated Reduction In Time (ERIT) Program, which is an optional tool that locations and organizational units may choose to implement as a cost saving resource. </summary><start-date>1400482800000</start-date><display-name> Employee-initiated Reduction In Time (ERIT) Program</display-name><path>/2014/05/erit-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/erit-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1400522600255</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400522619358</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;"><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The University is proposing to renew the Employee-initiated Reduction In Time (ERIT) Program, which is an optional tool that locations and organizational units may choose to implement as a cost saving resource. </span></span></p>

Pitchumani's work on storage technologies at UCSC's <a href="http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/">Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC)</a> came to the attention of Seagate representatives at the SSRC's annual research retreat in 2013. She will be presenting her latest results at this year's retreat, which takes place on Wednesday, May 21, at the <a href="http://soe.ucsc.edu">Baskin School of Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In the rapidly evolving field of data storage, the SSRC has been a leading academic research center for more than a decade. Strong relationships with top companies in the storage industry help ensure that SSRC researchers and graduate students are focusing their efforts on important problems and preparing for the challenges of the future, said Ethan Miller, professor of computer science and Pitchumani's adviser.</p>
<p>"When companies need to solve a problem to continue developing a product, we hope our research has created a foundation for an application," Miller said.</p>
<p>Pitchumani has been working on <a href="http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/proj/shingle.html">shingled disk</a> technology. Shingled disks were developed to enable computer disk drives to store more information by overlapping the data tracks like roof shingles. To write data on a shingled disk, however, a computer needs new software, and updating large server farms with shingled disks requires a labor-intensive software upgrade for each server. Pitchumani wanted to simplify that process by developing data management software that could be placed directly on a shingled disk. "Intelligent" disks could then manage themselves, eliminating the software installation step in upgrading server storage.</p>
<p><strong>Seagate internship</strong></p>
<p>After hearing Pitchumani's presentation last year, Seagate offered her an internship for the summer, during which she developed software for a shingled disk storage system. Pitchumani is working directly with several of Seagate's senior technologists to incorporate her work into a <a href="http://www.seagate.com/solutions/cloud/data-center-cloud/platforms/?cmpid=friendly-_-pr-kinetic-us">new storage platform</a> the company launched in mid-2013.</p>
<p>"Rekha has the perfect combination of a great organization in SSRC and a Ph.D. thesis that was a match for what the industry is struggling with," said James Hughes, principal technologist at Seagate. "Her ability to work all the way from abstract idea to the actual code makes what she does immediately relevant."</p>
<p>Seagate was ready to hire her after the internship, but Pitchumani said they understood that finishing her Ph.D. research is her first priority. Because of the university's close proximity to Seagate's offices in Cupertino, Pitchumani has continued a part-time internship with the company while working on her academic research.</p>
<p>She said she's happy her research is already having an impact in society. "Usually, Ph.D. students are not able to get their research into real products during graduate school," Pitchumani said.</p>
<p><strong>Industry relationships</strong></p>
<p>Since 2013, the SSRC has maintained its connections with companies in the data storage industry through the <a href="http://www.crss.ucsc.edu/">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> (CRSS), established at UCSC through the National Science Foundation's Industry/University Cooperative Research Program. CRSS receives more than $500,000 of support from industry each year. Company sponsors do not dictate what projects the UCSC researchers tackle, but they provide valuable input by identifying important challenges facing the industry.</p>
<p>Maintaining relationships with industry has been part of the SSRC philosophy since the group was founded more than a decade ago, said Darrell Long, professor of computer science and SSRC director. Many graduate alumni from the group now work at technology companies, while others have positions at universities and national laboratories. It's common for students in the data storage research group to have several job offers before they graduate, Long said.</p>
<p>Research conducted at SSRC often produces ideas and strategies that are later incorporated into commercial products. In the mid-1990s, for example, SSRC pioneered the use of "deduplication" to consolidate storage by taking advantage of redundancies in the data. Several companies took the ideas from that research and worked to improve the stability of the algorithms. About a decade later, products based on that original approach were on the market.</p>
<p><strong>Archival storage advances<br/></strong></p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, SSRC researchers developed new ways to archive data for long-term storage. Some start-up companies are building storage systems using the architecture developed at UCSC, and people who worked on the project as graduate students now work for those companies, Miller said.</p>
<p>Lawrence You, now director of privacy at Google, was among the graduate students who worked on deduplication and archival storage projects, earning his Ph.D. in 2006. He worked with Long to develop a highly efficient archival storage system, called <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2003/06/364.html">Deep Store</a>.</p>
<p>"Storing archival data over a long period of time is still a hard problem today because data volumes continue to grow, demands for online storage and cloud services are increasing, and data formats continue to evolve," You said. "Moreover, expectations of reliability, availability, and the need to ensure that data is protected now and deletable later further challenge us to develop new types of storage systems to satisfy those needs."</p>
<p>SSRC researchers try to anticipate problems that the storage industry might encounter within the next five years or so. The need for energy efficient storage, for example, is a growing concern, Miller said. The use of alternative materials in storage media will also create new challenges. At SSRC, researchers are already working to find solutions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a571766807270461ae4b3b89100afac"><name>galloway-miller</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Two initiatives to enhance graduate education</title><summary>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway and Graduate Dean Tyrus Miller announce two initiatives that will enhance graduate education -- and improve the quality of the undergraduate experience, as well. </summary><keywords>galloway, miller, graduate, undergraduate, TAships, teaching assistants, pedagogy, investment, allocation</keywords><start-date>1400569200000</start-date><display-name>Galloway-Miller</display-name><path>/2014/05/galloway-miller</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/galloway-miller</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1400601253689</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400601343631</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It's a pleasure to announce two initiatives that will enhance graduate education on campus&#8212;and, in turn, improve the quality of the UC Santa Cruz undergraduate experience as well. <br/><br/>First, we are funding more than 100 additional new TAships for the 2014-15 academic year, and we anticipate increasing the allocation to as many as 200 additional TAships the following year. These new TAships will increase the campus's ability to attract and retain the best graduate students by enhancing the financial package we are able to offer prospective students. It will also improve undergraduate learning and the pedagogical training our graduate students receive by allowing departments to offer smaller course sections. <br/><br/>Second, the newly announced Chancellor's Graduate Teaching Fellows program will allow 12-15 graduate students across campus to design and offer their own undergraduate course or undergraduate research mentorship. These graduate student-directed courses and mentorships, related to graduate thesis research and prospective teaching fields, provide our undergraduates with small class and research experience, innovative pedagogies, and chances to explore topics intensively in a closely mentored environment. <br/><br/>Together, these efforts reflect the campus's longstanding commitment to our students at both the graduate and undergraduate level. Each academic dean will decide how to allocate the funding for the new TAships, focusing on three priorities: improving the classroom experience for undergraduates and teaching assistants, increasing undergraduates' ability to make timely progress toward their degrees, and attracting new students to our doctoral programs. Their decisions will make a noticeable difference for students.<br/><br/>For several years, state-imposed budget cuts have hampered our ability to make strategic investments like these. It is a pleasure to be able now to direct rebenching and enrollment resources to supporting these crucial campus priorities. <br/><br/></p>

<p><a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/">Student Achievement Week</a> from June 2-6 recognizes students for their research and scholarly activities. Much of the actual work takes place out of the limelight, in labs, in libraries, in studios, and out in the field, but this very special week gives students a chance to share their work in a public setting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the time of year to honor outstanding achievement by undergraduate students in each division. <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/">This year&#8217;s Deans and Chancellor&#8217;s Awards recipients</a> are a diverse and enterprising group, focusing on subjects ranging from Santa Cruz silent cinema to dental robotics and the computational design of a melanoma treatment drug.</p>
<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal will be on hand to acknowledge the recipients and their faculty mentors at a private luncheon. &#160;Meanwhile, the identity of the Steck Award winner &#8211; selected from the Chancellor&#8217;s Awards winners &#8211; will be revealed near the end of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s Steck honoree is <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/steck-profile-kristoffer-hellen.html">Kristoffer Hell&#233;n</a>, who traveled to Europe and Russia to find out how two groups&#8212;the Estonians and the Maris&#8212;preserved their heritage in spite of, and in some sense, because of, living in places where cultures and religions clash and converge.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of other opportunities for well-wishers and community members to celebrate high achievement on campus. In fact, so much is happening that you would do well to consult <a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu">your handy campus map</a> as you make your way from venue to venue.</p>
<p>One early highlight is the Sesnon Gallery&#8217;s annual <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/irwin-scholars-2014">Irwin Scholarship Award exhibition</a> from May 22 through June 14, showcasing <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/irwin-scholars-exhibition.html">some of UCSC&#8217;s most promising student artists</a> working in painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, installation, video, digital media, and social practice. &#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/printsale/openstudios.html">Open Studios</a>, featuring student artwork in a variety of media including drawing, painting, print media, sculpture, photography, and electronic art, will be held Friday, June 6, from noon to 4 p.m., at the Baskin Visual Arts Center and Digital Arts Research Center (DARC).&#160; Open Studios runs in conjunction with the Digital Arts &amp; New Media (DANM) Open Studios.</p>
<p>Expect large and enthusiastic crowds for another Student Achievement Week favorite: the <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/printsale/index.html">UCSC Print Sale</a><b><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2098">,</a></b> which celebrates its 40th&#160;anniversary this year, and takes place Friday, June 6, and Saturday, June 7, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The sale will be held at the Printmaking Studio, Room G-101, at the Baskin Visual Arts Center. Items for sale will include original etchings, lithographs, woodcuts, digital prints, handmade books, and everything from &#8220;soft sculptures&#8221; to pennants, banners, postcards, and journals.</p>
<p>Profits benefit the student artists and the UCSC Printmaking Program. The event is also a chance to meet the artists and tour the printmaking facility.</p>
<p>One highlight of Student Achievement Week requires a visit to downtown Santa Cruz, but is well worth the side trip. The eighth-annual <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/8th-annual-social-documentation-graduate-exhibition">Social Documentation Graduate Exhibition</a>,<b> </b>an evening of documentary films from student of the Film and Digital Media's Social Documentation program, will be held Wednesday, June 11, at 6 p.m. at the Del Mar Theatre, 1124 Pacific Ave, Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Those who are craving a taste of Shakespeare should not miss <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/shakespeare-go">Shakespeare To Go: "Hamlet"</a> on Friday, June 6, at 11 a.m., at the Second Stage in the Theater Arts Center on campus. This year, a company of UCSC students will distill the tragic play into a fast-paced, inventive one-hour version in the group's final performance of the season. The event is free and open to the public.&#160;</p>
<p>Another highly anticipated event, shining a spotlight on outstanding undergraduate research, is the <a href="http://urps.soe.ucsc.edu">17th Annual Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium</a>, set for Thursday, June 5, from 2 to 4 p.m., in the Jack Baskin Engineering Courtyard. The event recognizes and promotes outstanding undergraduate research while allowing students to present their findings in a professional setting.</p>

In 2010, she received the UCSC Division of Social Sciences "Golden Apple" Distinguished Teaching Award and the next year won the UCSC Committee on Teaching's Excellence in Teaching Award. <br/><br/>Since 1992, Lu has been conducting research with the Huaorani Indians of the Ecuadorian Amazon, a predominantly subsistence-based population of hunter-gatherer-horticulturalists.&#160; During 1996-1997, she conducted her doctoral fieldwork among two Huaorani villages along the Shiripuno River. Using interdisciplinary approaches, she examines changes in resource use, household economic patterns, and social organization among indigenous rainforest communities in a context of rapid cultural, demographic, economic and ecological change.</p>

<p>As the Mildred Londa Weisman Fellow, Ramirez-Ruiz will pursue his research in theoretical astrophysics while part of a vibrant multidisciplinary community. The Radcliffe Fellowship Program, which has an acceptance rate of just 4 percent, brings together people from around the world to work on individual projects in the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences. Throughout the year, these scholars, scientists, and artists will share their ideas with one another and the public through presentations, lectures, concerts, and exhibitions.</p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz is developing the conceptual framework needed to understand the violent and capricious nature of the universe. He uses computer simulations to explore transient phenomena such as collisions, mergers, and disruptions of stars, especially those involving compact objects like black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs.</p>
<p>Much of his effort during the fellowship year will be dedicated to understanding the physics of gravitational wave emission and mass transfer in the interactions between pairs of compact objects. Both black holes and neutron stars can generate copious gravitational waves when they collide and merge. Because of this, simulations of such encounters play an essential role in ongoing efforts to detect gravitational waves.</p>
<p>"In general, all these phenomena, from extreme matter to event horizons and gravitational waves, cannot be created in a laboratory. Instead, we have no choice but to create virtual laboratories on Earth in order to simulate all the relevant physics in large-scale computational experiments," Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>He also plans to work on advanced visualization techniques for scientific communication. The cutting-edge simulations from his research group provide ideal raw material for research collaborations between digital-art students and computational science students. The simulations yield dynamic imagery with great power and beauty, which can be used to communicate research findings, inform the general public about science and the universe, and provide raw material for science curricula, documentaries, and astronomy presentations.</p>
<p>The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study is dedicated to creating and sharing transformative ideas across the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences.

Melanie Jean Springer, UC Santa Cruz assistant professor of politics, examines voter turnout in the United States, one of the lowest in any developed democracy, and reform efforts to improve it. <br/><br/>In <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo17322799.html"><em>How the States Shaped the Nation: American Electoral Institutions and Voter Turnout 1920-2000</em></a> (University of Chicago Press, 2014) she finds that states that try to boost turnout with convenience-voting methods such as motor-voter laws, generous absentee ballot rules, and longer polling times are far less successful than states that try to suppress turnout. <br/><br/>Though the poll taxes and literacy tests that southern (and some non-southern) states once used to quash the minority vote have been outlawed, other efforts such as voter ID laws and the reduction of polling places in certain neighborhoods have taken their place. <br/><br/>"People tend to think once we got away from poll taxes and voter registration suppression everything was good," said Springer, who joined the UCSC politics department last fall after seven years at Washington University in St. Louis.&#160; "One of my most persistent findings is when states try to restrict voter turnout they are quite effective (more so than when they try to make voting processes easier)," she said. "We should be alarmed."&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>U.S. federalism allows the states to control how voting will take place. States have had&#8212;and continue to have&#8212;sizable local effects, she says. "By design, this system fosters variability while also allowing, and perhaps even creating, instances of inequality," Springer writes in the book&#8217;s introduction that discusses the 2000 presidential election and Florida, with its butterfly ballots and hanging chads, the final result ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court after more than a month of court battles. &#160;<br/><br/>"The heightened awareness of state power over electoral procedures following the Bush vs. Gore election initiated widespread criticism of the American electoral system, and spurred countless calls for national electoral reform," Springer writes. <br/><br/>Although reformers often assume that more convenient voting procedures will produce equivalent effects wherever they are implemented, she reveals that this is not the case. In fact, convenience-voting methods have had almost no effect in the southern states where turnout rates are lowest.<br/><br/>Springer focuses her analysis on the 80 years between 1920 and 2000, the period following the Progressive era up through the Bush-Gore election. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Springer argues, no single institutional fix will uniformly resolve problems of low or unequal participation. If we want to reliably increase national voter turnout rates, we must explore how states&#8217; voting histories differ, and better understand the role of political and geographical context in shaping institutional effects, she says.<br/><br/>Springer earned her B.A. at UC San Diego in political science and history, and her Ph.D. in political science at Columbia University. She is teaching two classes this spring and in the fall, American Elections and Voting Behavior and Society and Democracy in American Political Development.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Applying now will increase your&#160;chance of getting the permit you want. If you request that your permit be mailed to you, you can avoid waiting in line&#160;next fall. We mail student permits out beginning the last week of August and through the first week of September. To&#160;receive your permit by mail during that two-week window, be sure to select "Mail To Residential Address" in the&#160;Delivery Options section of the application. Otherwise, you can pick your permit up when you arrive on campus in&#160;September.<br/>&#160;<br/>If you're considering whether you need a car on campus, check out Zipcar, UCSC's car-sharing program. Students 18&#160;and over can rent cars on an hourly or daily basis. Members have access to nineteen vehicles -- ten on campus and&#160;nine in the City of Santa Cruz, 24 hours per day. For detailed information, visit&#160;<a href="http://www.zipcar.com/ucsc/">http://www.zipcar.com/ucsc/</a>.<br/>&#160;<br/>If you choose to drive your car to campus, consider sharing your ride. Zimride, a ride-matching program that is&#160;exclusive to the UCSC community, makes it easy to find other students who want to carpool. By carpooling, you can&#160;reduce your carbon footprint and save on expenses, including the cost of an R or C Carpool parking permit.

The program is free and open to the public. <br/><br/>The "Gun Culture Roundtable" is sponsored by the Co-curricular Programs unit at College Nine and College Ten and will be moderated by UCSC sociology professor Craig Reinarman. <br/><br/>Access to and restriction of firearms is one of the most contentious social issues in the United States.&#160; The nation is unique in the degree to which people have access to firearms, and the Second Amendment states: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed." Adding to the complexity, gun laws vary widely from state to state. The debate heightens every time another mass shooting happens. <br/><br/>Panelists scheduled to discuss these issues are Guy Smith, an independent gun policy researcher and creator of the Gun Facts Project; Adam Winkler, UCLA professor of law and specialist in American Constitutional law; Harry Salzberg, attorney and president of the Santa Cruz Chapter of the Brady Campaign; and Walter Stockwell, founding member of the Liberal Gun Club Northern California Chapter.<br/><br/>Smith, an independent gun policy researcher for 15 years, is creator and editor of the Gun Facts project, described as a resource for removing misinformation from the gun control debate. He also has published <em>Shooting The Bull</em>, a field guide to identifying propaganda in real-time, and one that uses the gun control debate as a case study. <br/><br/>Winkler is a specialist in American constitutional law. His scholarship touches upon a diverse array of topics such as the right to bear arms, corporate political speech rights, affirmative action, judicial independence, constitutional interpretation, corporate social responsibility, international economic sanctions, and campaign finance law. Along with professor Ken Karst of the UCLA School of Law and the late Pulitzer Prize-winning legal historian Leonard Levy, Winkler edited the six-volume Encyclopedia of the American Constitution (2nd edition).&#160; His book <em>Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America</em> was published in 2011.<br/><br/>Salzberg is an attorney living in Santa Cruz County who has served as the president of the Santa Cruz County Chapter of Brady Campaign Against Gun Violence since 2009. <br/><br/>Stockwell is a native Californian, gun owner, and a registered Green party member. He is a founding member of the Liberal Gun Club, Northern California Chapter, a group started to provide a home for gun owners who find they don't fit in with the other gun culture. He earned a Ph.D. in particle astrophysics at UC Berkeley.<br/><br/>&#160;Since 2004, the Co-curricular Programs unit at College Nine and College Ten, UCSC has facilitated debates and roundtable discussions addressing some of the most challenging and controversial topics of our time. These programs have offered a platform where experts with widely differing viewpoints have debated topics including affirmative action, the war in Iraq, abortion rights, marriage equality, animals in research, military recruitment at public institutions, and most recently&#8211;free speech at college campuses. &#160;<br/><br/>In each case, presenters have articulated their perspective and respectfully challenged opposing viewpoints. Students have benefited by gaining a deeper understanding of the complexity and depth of the issues presented, as well as through observing the respectful discourse and debate skills modeled on the stage.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="26531f87807270461ae4b3b8ca63aaee"><name>cafin-spring-lecture</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CAFIN Spring Lecture: Finance at light speed, high-frequency trading</title><summary>An expert on high-frequency stock market trading will deliver the Spring Lecture of the UC Santa Cruz Center for Analytical Finance (CAFIN) on Wednesday, May 28, from 3:30-5 p.m. in the Simularium, E2 Building on the UCSC campus. </summary><start-date>1400802000000</start-date><display-name>CAFIN spring lecture</display-name><path>/2014/05/cafin-spring-lecture</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/cafin-spring-lecture</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1400802320221</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1400882390448</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/hendershott-150.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/hendershott-150.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hendershott-150.jpg</name><display-name>hendershott-150.jpg</display-name><file-size>42310</file-size><width>150</width><height>172</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/hendershott-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/hendershott-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hendershott-80.jpg</name><display-name>hendershott-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>23484</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Professor Terrence Hendershott</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An expert on high-frequency stock market trading will deliver the Spring Lecture of the <a href="http://cafin.ucsc.edu">UC Santa Cruz Center for Analytical Finance</a> (CAFIN) on Wednesday, May 28, from 3:30-5 p.m. in the Simularium, E2 Building on the UCSC campus. The lecture is free and open to the public. <br/><br/>Professor Terrence Hendershott of the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley will speak on &#8220;High Frequency Trading and the 2008 Short Sale Ban.&#8221;&#160; High-frequency trading and efforts to understand its consequences were recently the subject of the book <em>Flash Boys</em>.</p>
<p>In the research on which his talk is based, Hendershott and collaborators examine the effects of high-frequency traders (HFTs) on liquidity and price efficiency using the September 2008 short sale ban as an example.</p>
<p><strong>Prominent academic</strong></p>
<p>Hendershott is among the most prominent academics working on high-frequency trading. He holds the Cheryl and Christian Valentine Chair as an associate professor at the Haas School of business.&#160; He completed his Ph.D. at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. His current research interests include information technology&#8217;s impact and role in financial markets, the structure and regulation of financial markets, and the interaction between trading and asset price dynamics.</p>
<p>His writing has appeared in the <em>Financial Times</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and his research has been written about in the<em> New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> and other national newspapers and magazines. His academic work has been published in the most prestigious finance and economic journals. He edited Elsevier&#8217;s <em>Handbook of Economics and Information Systems</em>. He has received a National Science Foundation CAREER award for his research on electronic trading in financial markets.</p>
<p>Hendershott was the visiting economist at the New York Stock Exchange in 2006 to 2007 and was a member of the Nasdaq Economic Advisory Board from 2004 to 2007 and chair in 2007. He has consulted for various financial markets and investment firms.</p>
<p>CAFIN is a new research center at UC Santa Cruz, dedicated to exploring the challenge of improving financial intermediation in an interconnected, volatile world. Specific focus areas are market design, systemic risk and financial access.</p>
<p><strong>Inaugural workshop</strong></p>
<p>In April, CAFIN organized an inaugural workshop supported by the Dean of Social Sciences at UCSC, the UCSC Foundation Board and UCSC alumnus Stephen Bruce. Presenters from around the world attended the workshop, including Hong Kong, India, Turkey and Canada. Speakers included academics as well as researchers from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and the Central Securities Depository of Turkey.</p>
<p>Within CAFIN, steering committee member Professor Eric Aldrich of Economics has been working with Professor Gregory Laughlin, chair of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, to devise fundamental new techniques for understanding the patterns of financial trading at high speeds. Their core insight is that the pattern of trading can be understood better by using trades as measures of time (&#8220;trade time&#8221;), rather than conventional &#8220;clock time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their ongoing work, which will soon be available as an inaugural CAFIN working paper, investigates the behavior of asset returns both during and outside of pre-scheduled news announcement periods. They develop a statistical model that characterizes the distributions of returns at fine time scales, outside of news announcements. This has immediate implications for broad topics such as market volatility, derivatives pricing, and potential for market failure.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://cafin.ucsc.edu</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Center for Analytical Finance</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="299e21e7807270461ae4b3b845a0d0d9"><name>baskin-plaque</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC honors Jack Baskin with a plaque at the Baskin School of Engineering</title><summary>Campus leaders honored Jack Baskin for his many contributions to the Baskin School of Engineering in a ceremony on Thursday.</summary><keywords>Jack Baskin, Baskin School of Engineering, Baskin Engineering Building</keywords><start-date>1400828400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC honors Jack Baskin with a plaque at the Baskin School of Engineering</display-name><path>/2014/05/baskin-plaque</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/baskin-plaque</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1400857567676</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401752127065</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/baskin-group-540.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/baskin-group-540.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>baskin-group-540.jpg</name><display-name>baskin-group-540.jpg</display-name><file-size>114822</file-size><width>540</width><height>341</height></image><image-alt>Baskins and campus leaders at plaque ceremony</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/jack-baskin-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/jack-baskin-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jack-baskin-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jack-baskin-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30600</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jack Baskin</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Engineering dean Art Ramirez, Jack Baskin, Peggy Downes Baskin, Kelly Weisberg, and Chancellor George Blumenthal posed beside the new plaque honoring Jack Baskin for his contributions to the Baskin School of Engineering.

A plaque in his honor, unveiled by Chancellor George Blumenthal at the ceremony, now marks the entrance to the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Baskin has been actively supporting engineering programs at UCSC for several decades, providing guidance to faculty and campus leadership as well as generous financial support. His cornerstone gift helped launch the Baskin School of Engineering in 1997, and his donations to the engineering school now total $8.8 million. Baskin and his wife, Peggy Downes Baskin, have also supported many other programs at UCSC.</p>
<p>"When you look around UC Santa Cruz, you see Jack Baskin's influence everywhere," said Chancellor Blumenthal. "From engineering to the arts and humanities, his support transforms lives through scholarships, programs that open doors for our students, and endowed chairs for faculty that propel research and discovery."</p>
<p>Engineering dean Art Ramirez said the plaque ensures that everyone who comes to the Baskin School of Engineering will be able to see who Jack Baskin is and why the school is named for him. The large bronze plaque is mounted by the entrance to the Baskin Engineering Building, which was renamed in his honor in 1999 (it was originally the Applied Sciences Building).</p>
<p>"Jack Baskin's generosity and vision have helped build the Baskin School of Engineering into an innovative and well-respected center for learning and research, where students and faculty are working with industry partners to tackle the challenges of the 21st century," Ramirez said.</p>
<p>The first in his family to attend college, Baskin earned a B.S. in aeronautical engineering from New York University and built a successful development company that worked on commercial, industrial, and public construction projects throughout California. He served as a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee for many years, including two years as chair, and was honored as the first recipient of UCSC's "Fiat Lux Award" in 2005.</p>
<p>Baskin's support for the engineering school includes the establishment of endowed chairs for faculty in computer engineering (now supporting two faculty positions), biomolecular engineering, and technology and information management. Another major gift in 2011 established the Jack Baskin and Peggy Downes Baskin Fellowships to support engineering graduate students. The Baskins have also supported programs to bring more women into the field of engineering, such as the UCSC Girls in Engineering summer school program, which Peggy Downes Baskin helped create and fund.</p>
<p>In 2006, Jack Baskin was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame. He is among the foremost philanthropists in the Santa Cruz Community, supporting the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County (which he helped found), Dominican Hospital, Cabrillo College, and many organizations for children, families, and senior citizens.</p>

<div>It is time for staff and faculty to renew or purchase&#160;parking permits and Metro bus passes for 2014-15.<br/> &#160;<br/> There are no parking fee increases at this time; however, a&#160;$1.25/month increase to the faculty/staff bus pass has been recommended by the campus Transportation Advisory Committee. This increase will take the current $8.75/month rate to $10/month. (The monthly rate for non-university affiliates is $65/month.)&#160;The new rate will take affect as soon as final approval is made by senior administrators&#160;<b>and will automatically be applied to your payroll deduction.</b></div>
<div>&#160;<br/> Annual parking permits and staff/faculty Metro bus passes&#160;expire on June 30, 2014. Staff and faculty who need to renew their parking&#160;permit or bus pass for 2014-15 can apply on-line now (<a href="http://basx2.ucsc.edu/application14/">http://basx2.ucsc.edu/application14/</a>),&#160;or in person at the TAPS Sales&#160;Office.&#160;</div>
<div>&#160;<br/> Staff and Faculty with Multi-Year&#160;parking permits do not need to reapply in order to continue using their permit,&#160;unless&#160;they want to select a different type of permit or want to purchase a 2014-15&#160;Metro bus pass. If you are unsure if you have a Multi-Year permit you can compare it to the online permit samples at&#160;<a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/parking-permits/multi-year-permit-sample.html">http://taps.ucsc.edu/parking/parking-permits/multi-year-permit-sample.html</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Note: &#160;Due to construction projects near Cowell, Stevenson, and Humanities this summer, parking in that area will be significantly reduced from mid-June to mid-September. An information session with representatives from Physical Planning &amp; Construction, Physical Plant, and TAPS has been set for Friday, May 30, from 1:30-2:30pm in the Cowell Conference Room. Those who regularly park in that area may wish to attend the information session before renewing their permit.</div>

<div>&#160;<br/>There are no fee increases at this time.<br/>&#160;<br/>If you request that your permit be mailed to you, you can avoid waiting in line next fall. We mail student permits out beginning the last week of August and through the first week of&#160;September. To receive your permit by mail during that two-week window, be sure to select "Mail To Residential Address" in the Delivery Options section of the application. Otherwise, you&#160;can pick your permit up when you arrive on campus in September.<br/>&#160;<br/>If you're considering whether you need a car on campus, check out Zipcar, UCSC's car-sharing program. Students 18 and over can rent cars on an hourly or daily basis. Members have&#160;access to nineteen vehicles -- ten on campus and nine in the City of Santa Cruz, 24 hours per day. For detailed information, visit&#160;<a href="http://www.zipcar.com/ucsc/">http://www.zipcar.com/ucsc/</a>.</div>
<div>&#160;<br/>If you choose to drive your car to campus, consider sharing your ride. Zimride, a ride-matching program that is exclusive to the UCSC community, makes it easy to find other students who&#160;want to carpool. By carpooling, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save on expenses, including the cost of an R or B Carpool parking permit. For more information, go to&#160;<a href="http://zimride.ucsc.edu/">http://zimride.ucsc.edu</a>.</div>

<p>But that's where the San Francisco resident and dancer landed last year. Porter, a 22-year-old history major and Kresge College student who will graduate in June, was part of a unique undergraduate research project at UCSC, called <a href="http://cspwm.ucsc.edu">The Gail Project</a>, that is exploring the complicated world of Okinawa in the 1950s through a series of photos taken by a U.S. serviceman named Charles Gail.</p>
<p>One day, the photos will not only be part of a traveling exhibit that chronicles the story of a people whose lives and society were upended by war but will also serve as a bridge between students at UCSC and their counterparts on the Japanese island.</p>
<p>"It's a topic," said Porter, "that's really underexplored. What we want to do is provide a forum for discussion about something that is still an issue right now."</p>
<p>Porter's path to this slice of history was a circuitous one. She came to UCSC thinking she would go to law school. A freshman history class on the Middle East taught by Professor Terry Burke shifted her focus, however. Alerted to a senior seminar on the Gail photos being taught by Associate Professor of East Asian Studies Alan Christy, Porter, now a history major, dove into the project.</p>
<p>As Porter spoke, she clicked through a slide show of Gail's black-and-white photos, which captured fishermen and shopkeepers at work in post-war Okinawa, rain-black ocean squalls, and a laughing old woman holding a small child.</p>
<p>The photos, she explained, were taken after Gail arrived in Okinawa in 1951 to run an Army hospital. It was a time when the expansion of U.S. military bases on the war-ravaged island was beginning to ramp up. The photos Gail took documented a way of life that would soon disappear, a last glimpse of a time before the presence of thousands of military personnel and U.S. influence changed the face of Okinawa. The pictures had been donated to UCSC Special Collections by Gail's daughter, Geri Gail, in 2013.</p>
<p>Porter, who was doing a concentration on Latin America at the time, soon fell under the spell of the images. They inspired her to research a little-known piece of history: the relocation of those of Okinawan ancestry from their homes in Peru to U.S. internment camps during WWII, where, when the war ended, they were declared illegal immigrants and shipped to Okinawa, a land completely foreign to them. A research trip to Japan, supported by grants and student fundraising, yielded even more information.</p>
<p>"Her research was very important to the project," Christy said. "It showed Okinawa was not an isolated, tiny island but that it had a global perspective of its own."</p>
<p>"What I love about the project is that it is so collaborative," said Porter, who became co-director of the undertaking. Each student in the seminar brought their own skills and interests to the project, working on web pages, video or research into topics as varied as land ownership and crime on the island. Like other students, Porter was so passionate about the project she continued to work on it even as she choreographed and danced in two UCSC performances.</p>
<p>Porter, who will graduate in June and move back to San Francisco, said she hopes to continue to work on The Gail Project, even as a new class of students arrives in the fall to add to the venture. Christy, meanwhile, is organizing a collaboration between UCSC students and those at the University of Ryukyu and Meio University in Okinawa in order to do more research on residents in the photos, many of whom may still be alive.</p>
<p>The project will culminate in a traveling exhibition to Okinawa, Honolulu, and Los Angeles, among other places, and Porter hopes to be there for the unveiling, even as she pursues her vision of teaching abroad someday.</p>
<p>The exhibit's time period, Porter said, "is a template for other occupations and wars. I think it's a history project but it is also relevant now."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2aa1c8ce807270461ae4b3b8392b0cd6"><name>grad-project-2014-odigie-kingsley</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The impact of wildfires</title><summary>A grad student who came to the U.S. from Nigeria with dreams of becoming a scientist discovers a hidden consequence of fires.</summary><keywords>Kingsley Odigie</keywords><start-date>1400828400000</start-date><display-name>The impact of wildfires</display-name><path>/2014/05/grad-project-2014-odigie-kingsley</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/grad-project-2014-odigie-kingsley</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1400874584230</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401381916163</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Environmental Toxicology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/KingsleyOdigie.300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/KingsleyOdigie.300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>KingsleyOdigie.300.jpg</name><display-name>KingsleyOdigie.300.jpg</display-name><file-size>706843</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Microbiology and environmental toxicology graduate student Kingsley Odigie is investigatin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/KingsleyOdigie.thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/KingsleyOdigie.thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>KingsleyOdigie.thumb.jpg</name><display-name>KingsleyOdigie.thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>594597</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Microbiology and environmental toxicology graduate student Kingsley Odigie is investigatin</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Microbiology and environmental toxicology graduate student&#160;Kingsley Odigie is investigating the impacts of wildfires on the release and transport of contaminants in the environment.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Grad student who came to the U.S. from Nigeria with dreams of becoming a scientist discovers a hidden consequence of fires</article-subhead><article-text><p>On a warm afternoon in May 2009, fire erupted in the mountains above Santa Barbara. The flames burned 8,733 acres and destroyed 80 homes.</p>
<p>But UC Santa Cruz graduate student Kingsley Odigie, who had come to the U.S. from Nigeria with dreams of becoming a scientist, discovered another consequence of the blaze. It released noxious lead into the environment.</p>
<p>Years of leaded gasoline use and exhaust-spewing cars had released lead that was then sequestered by plants and soil in the area. But what Odigie discovered &#8212; along with UCSC Professor of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology Russ Flegal &#8212; was that the metal, which can cause neurological problems in both children and adults, was remobilized when the vegetation burned.</p>
<p>Flame reawakened the toxic beast.</p>
<p>For Odigie, the finding was the result not only of six years of research but also of his fierce determination to overcome the hardships he faced. On June 13 at 4 p.m. at UCSC's East Field, Odigie will mark that accomplishment when he receives his doctorate in environmental toxicology.</p>
<p>Odigie arrived in the U.S. in 2002 without knowing a single person. He had grown up in a humble apartment in Benin City in southern Nigeria, having never stepped beyond the boundaries of his country. His mother was a businesswoman and his father, an elementary school teacher, had died when Odigie was young.</p>
<p>But Odigie remembered the long talks he had with his dad about science and about the importance of education.</p>
<p>"During that time, my father didn't have too much opportunity," Odigie explained. "He wanted to encourage us (his children) to get an education because he was not able to do it."</p>
<p>Alone and without family, Odigie blended into the students at San Jose State University. But what set him apart was that, in addition to his classes, Odigie sometimes worked up to 60 hours a week to support his studies. He held down a full-time night job and a part-time day job. Still, he managed to earn a double major in microbiology and forensic science with a minor in chemistry. His grades were so good, he was accepted into the Ph.D. program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>It was at the wooded campus, Odigie said, that he discovered his love of research.</p>
<p>"It allows me to be inquisitive," Odigie said of scientific study. "It's like: Here is a problem and, OK, let's solve it. It makes me feel like I am helping the human race advance knowledge."</p>
<p>Odigie spent hours collecting and analyzing samples that led to his discoveries.</p>
<p>"I know that when I call our lab in the middle of the night, the odds are he (Odigie) would answer the phone," said Flegal, who described Odigie as having "an exceptional work ethic."</p>
<p>Odigie's findings, published in the journal <i>Environmental Science and Technology,</i> have broad implications for the future as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires.</p>
<p>"As Kingsley has shown, those fires remobilize lead and associated pollutants that have been sequestered in forests, adding to the current levels of those pollutants in the atmosphere where they may be inhaled by humans and other organisms," Flegal said.</p>
<p>Flegal also noted that Odigie found time to mentor undergraduates and work with visiting scientists while he was at UCSC.</p>
<p>Odigie offers a wide smile. "As they say, science is not complete until it is shared," he said.</p>
<p>Sitting in a fourth-floor meeting room in UCSC's Physical Sciences building, Odigie said he plans to pursue post-doctoral research, then go into teaching and research where he can help expand and spread knowledge &#8212; just as his father would have dreamed.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2aee5c36807270461ae4b3b80253833b"><name>grad-project-2014-intro</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Congrats, Class of 2014!</title><summary>Ideally, we'd profile every one of UCSC's talented, passionate, and determined graduates--but the three students featured here serve as excellent representatives of the Class of 2014.</summary><start-date>1401379200000</start-date><display-name>Congrats, Class of 2014!</display-name><path>/2014/05/grad-project-2014-intro</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/grad-project-2014-intro</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1400879602704</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401739925925</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Environmental Toxicology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Jourdonnais</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/grad-project-2014-intro-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/grad-project-2014-intro-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grad-project-2014-intro-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>grad-project-2014-intro-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24429</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Celebrating commencement</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Congratulations to UC Santa Cruz's Class of 2014!</p>

<p>Like many of you, I awoke this morning to the horrific news that a number of people were killed last night by a gunman in Isla Vista, a community adjacent to UC Santa Barbara.&#160;I want to share with you a&#160;<a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/statement-uc-president-janet-napolitano-mass-shooting-near-uc-santa-barbara">statement</a>&#160;that UC President Janet Napolitano just issued about this tragedy.</p>
<p>I have reached out to Chancellor Henry Yang, offering resources and assistance in any way that would help our sister campus. Police Chief Nader Oweis has also been in contact with UCSB police, with a similar offer of assistance.</p>
<p>As it's a three-day weekend, offices on our campus will be closed until Tuesday morning. But if there are UCSC students who need support before our Counseling and Psychological Services Office reopens, please don't hesitate to contact the after-hours phone service (831-459-2628)&#160;that CAPS provides.</p>
<p>I know that I speak for our entire campus community when I say that our hearts go out to the families and friends of the victims of this tragedy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor George Blumenthal</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3e71b683807270461ae4b3b896909d4a"><name>phthalate-alternatives</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>NSF grant funds development of alternatives to phthalate plasticizers</title><summary>Chemistry professor Rebecca Braslau has developed a new approach that could lead to a safe and affordable alternative to widely used phthalates</summary><keywords>Rebecca Braslau, phthalates, phthalate alternatives, phthalate chemistry</keywords><start-date>1401174000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC chemists developing alternatives to phthalate plasticizers</display-name><path>/2014/05/phthalate-alternatives</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/phthalate-alternatives</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1401206978131</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401207255942</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/rebecca-braslau-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/rebecca-braslau-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rebecca-braslau-250.jpg</name><display-name>rebecca-braslau-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>61513</file-size><width>250</width><height>274</height></image><image-alt>Rebecca Braslau</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/rebecca-braslau-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/rebecca-braslau-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rebecca-braslau-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>rebecca-braslau-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23121</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Rebecca Braslau</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Rebecca Braslau</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Chemistry professor Rebecca Braslau has developed a new approach that could lead to a safe and affordable alternative to widely used phthalates</article-subhead><article-text><p>Rebecca Braslau, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, has received a $480,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to support her research to develop a safe and affordable alternative to phthalate plasticizers.</p>
<p>Phthalates are synthetic chemicals added to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to make flexible plastics. Due to health concerns, phthalates have been banned from children's products in the United States and Europe, but they are still used in a wide range of consumer products, including food wrap, medical devices, automotive parts, and building materials.</p>
<p>Phthalates are readily absorbed by the body through inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact. Because phthalates are not chemically bound to the PVC polymer, they tend to migrate out of plastic products and into the environment. The same is true of alternative plasticizers currently on the market. Braslau's approach is to use compounds similar to phthalates that can be chemically attached to the PVC polymer chain.</p>
<p>"We want our phthalate mimics to be part of the polymer so they won't leak out, and even if they do, it would be as part of a larger molecule that wouldn't have the same health effects," Braslau said.</p>
<p>Phthalate exposure has been associated with reproductive and developmental abnormalities in animal studies. Epidemiological studies in humans also suggest that exposure to phthalates may have adverse health effects, including reproductive abnormalities that can lead to infertility. Phthalates are metabolized by the body into compounds that are considered "endocrine disruptors," chemicals that interfere with the body's hormone systems. Effects on wildlife of phthalates in the environment are also a concern.</p>
<p>Braslau first began studying phthalates several years ago and published a paper showing how a phthalate mimic could be incorporated into the PVC polymer. A key part of the process required an expensive chemical step, however, so she didn't pursue it any further. More recently, however, she realized that a similar target could be prepared using much simpler "click" chemistry. "It's called a click reaction because it's so easy it's like snapping your fingers," Braslau said.</p>
<p>First she found a click reaction that made most of the desired structure, but required a copper catalyst. She kept searching the literature and eventually found a reaction she could use that didn't require copper. After experimenting with the procedure in her lab, she and her students showed that the reaction works at room temperature to make a compound very similar to a phthalate, with a chemical bond to a PVC polymer. Those results were published earlier this year in a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/marc.201300865/abstract">paper by Braslau and graduate student Aruna Earla in <i>Macromolecular Rapid Communications</i></a><i>.</i></p>
<p>"Now we have a process that could potentially be used by industry," Braslau said.</p>
<p>The NSF grant will fund ongoing work by Braslau's laboratory and several collaborators to further develop this process and test the properties of the resulting polymers. Polymerizing PVC requires special equipment, so Braslau's group prepares the chemical subunits and will send them to the laboratory of Virgil Percec at the University of Pennsylvania for polymerization. She will also be collaborating with the Polymers and Coatings Program at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where the material properties of the new polymers will be tested.</p>
<p>"We'll be going down there to measure the properties of our samples so we can tell whether it is working effectively as a plasticizer," Braslau said. "We need to explore how much to put in and how it changes the physical properties of the material."</p>
<p>Another area she wants to investigate, although it is not covered by the current grant, is how the new materials will break down in the environment. "Eventually it will biodegrade into something, and before we scale up it would be prudent to make sure it doesn't biodegrade into something toxic," she said.</p>
<p>Whether her approach will provide a commercially viable alternative to phthalate plasticizers remains to be seen, but Braslau said it's important to try because phthalates are so widely used.</p>
<p>"The amounts are astronomical, on the scale of a million tons per year," she said. "It could really make a big difference to both human and wildlife populations if we succeed in developing an affordable and safer replacement for phthalate plasticizers."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3f989568807270461ae4b3b8e2fcc679"><name>reminder-to-vote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>June 3 is Primary Election Day — Reminder to Vote</title><summary>Tuesday, June 3 is Primary Election Day.

Five years ago, Santa Cruz County and portions of Santa Clara County went Internet dark when vandals severed four AT&amp;T fiber optic cables near San Jose. &#160;<br/><br/>The state Public Utilities Commission last month approved the grant by the California Advanced Services Fund that will pay 80 percent of the cost of installing new lines and bolstering broadband services from Santa Cruz south. The fund collects a small amount of money each month from phone customers. <br/><br/>UCSC, which has been involved in broadband planning for years, saw the opportunity to help bring high-speed Internet to underserved communities and bolster and secure the campus's access. UCSC faculty and students use massive amounts of data transmission for research in genomics, astronomy, and big data studies among other projects. <br/><br/>Brad Smith, UCSC's director of research and faculty partnerships in Information Technology Services, said the state was looking for proposals to increase broadband access to areas with poor service. The university, meanwhile, saw the need for another high-speed information pipeline so it wasn't reliant on a single line coming over the hill from Sunnyvale. That line was installed four years ago in a collaborative effort with the university and others and linked the UCSC campus to the California Research and Education Network (CalREN). &#160;<br/><br/>"What if there were a fire," said Smith, who is also an adjunct professor of computer science. "We were looking madly to get something south."<br/><br/>UCSC partnered with Sunesys, a telecommunications company that provides fiber optic networks, to apply for the grant and establish the new data link. Sunesys installed the line four years ago from Silicon Valley to UCSC. <br/><br/>That line has now been extended into downtown Santa Cruz where Cruzio Internet resells high-speed service. The new backbone will allow existing Internet service providers such as Cruzio to build out their networks and provide high-speed alternatives to those owned by AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon. &#160;<br/><br/>The new fiber to be installed over the next two years is known as "middle mile." Jim Warner, a UCSC network engineer, said Cruzio and Surfnet Communications, another ISP, can tap into it and provide "last mile" retail service. Smith said the capacity of the network is "pretty much unlimited. As demand grows we can load more and more data on these pipes," he said. <br/><br/>To help secure the grant, Smith and Warner visited Monterey County communities, tested service levels and completed surveys and data analysis to show the state that existing networks were not providing service at a level that matched their coverage claims.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/04/3669.html</url><title>Previous coverage of broadband upgrades </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="43a40a28807270461ae4b3b8dadc7cdb"><name>counseling-for-students</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Caring for yourself during this difficult time</title><summary>During these difficult times we look to our community to help us through.

<p>We were all stunned and saddened by the tragic events at our sister UC campus this past Friday evening.&#160; As we process our grief regarding this sudden and senseless event, we must remember to care for ourselves and those around us.&#160; Those of you with friends or family in the Santa Barbara community or who have experienced trauma in your own lives may be particularly impacted.&#160; Here are a few things to keep in mind over the next few days:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reach out to friends and family-they do care and may be having a similar reaction as you.&#160; Talk is the most healing medicine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep your lives as normal as possible-stay busy and structure your time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t numb the pain with overuse of drugs or alcohol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember-you are having a normal reaction to an abnormal event</p>
</li>
</ul>

One student's answer—UC Santa Cruz's first student-run scientific magazine</article-subhead><article-text><p>The idea began to grow as Nick Lounsbury walked the halls of UC Santa Cruz's Science Hill two years ago.</p>
<p>Posters tacked on walls touted scientific discoveries. Behind the closed doors of labs, researchers were doing innovative work: creating exoskeletons to help stroke victims recover mobility and studying what happens in our brains when we learn new things, for instance.</p>
<p>"I started to connect some dots," says Lounsbury, a 22-year-old neuroscience and mathematics major and Cowell College student who will graduate June 14. "I thought: There is cutting-edge research going on right in our backyard and no one knows about it."</p>
<p>Lounsbury's answer? The creation of UC Santa Cruz's first student-run scientific magazine: <i>Scientific Slug.</i></p>
<p>Sitting in a wooden Adirondack chair amid the plants and vines that fill Thimann Labs' rooftop greenhouse and nursery, Lounsbury is thoughtful as he describes his years of discovery and exploration at UCSC: potlucks where philosophy and ideas were the main course, gatherings where students and faculty shared thoughts on wide-ranging topics, and late-night discussions on life and existence.</p>
<p>It was in this environment that Lounsbury, the son of two psychotherapists and a self-described "big-picture guy," began delving into neuroscience and math.</p>
<p>He found himself attending sessions of a student-led club called Brain, Mind and Consciousness and becoming so passionate about mathematics he would spend some Saturday nights just solving problems. He volunteered at one of UCSC's research labs.</p>
<p>Into that heady mix came the thought that science's innovative ideas needed to be shared.</p>
<p>"I'd never written a science-based article, but I knew how to read and write, and if you asked me to explain something I could do it," Lounsbury says. "The fact is, it (the magazine) needed to happen."</p>
<p>He recruited students from disciplines as varied as art and engineering. He met with UCSC's Science Communication Program Director Rob Irion.</p>
<p>"I'm so impressed by Nick's initiative and passion," Irion says. "Many undergraduates have talked with me about major projects like this, but Nick is the only one who followed through."</p>
<p>While Lounsbury was listed as the magazine editor, the publication was collaborative, he says. Students brought ideas, began research, submitted artwork. Page templates were created, stories were edited, and an introduction to the magazine was crafted.</p>
<p>"Our values were to communicate science, provide an alternative means of education, and connect students to researchers," Lounsbury says of the magazine. "It was about nerding out on science."</p>
<p><i>Scientific Slug</i>'s first edition included stories on why native tree squirrels were becoming scarce on campus, an exploration of Professor Daniel Friedman's work on conspicuous consumption, and a look at Associate Professor of Physics Stefano Profumo's investigation of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).</p>
<p>Art ranged from a geometric explosion of brilliantly hued colors to a comic-book-style illustration of how microbes contribute to arsenic contamination of drinking water.</p>
<p>So far, there have only been two editions and funding only allowed the printing of 350 copies, but the impact of the magazine was more profound.</p>
<p>"The new magazine has catalyzed a group of young writers on campus, many of whom hope to make communicating about science part of their career," Irion says. "It also sparks excitement about research at UCSC and gives students ideas about how to get involved."</p>
<p>For his part, Lounsbury is pleased to know that a new crop of writers will continue the magazine next year.</p>
<p>"I will be perfectly content and thrilled if, when I come back to campus in the future, there will still be a group of people who want to talk about science," says Lounsbury, who hopes to work in big data, neuroscience, or statistics research someday. "Whether it (<i>Scientific Slug</i>) is still a magazine or it's a movie or whatever, as long as students are doing that, I'll be perfectly happy."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="43e493db807270461ae4b3b8b690ce30"><name>possible-uaw-strike</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Possible UAW Strike in June</title><summary>The United Auto Workers union, representing academic student employees on UC campuses, has indicated that it is preparing for a systemwide strike that would begin June 7.</summary><start-date>1401174000000</start-date><display-name>Possible UAW Strike in June</display-name><path>/2014/05/possible-uaw-strike</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/possible-uaw-strike</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1401298391992</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401298495463</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The United Auto Workers union, representing academic&#160;student employees on UC campuses, has indicated that&#160;it is preparing for a systemwide&#160;strike that would begin June 7.</span></div>

Traditionally, researchers and institutions have been evaluated based on citations in academic journals. <br/><br/>The project considered work in five social science disciplines: anthropology, economics, politics, psychology, and sociology at 94 top universities. It compared 50,000 news searches, from 6,000 sources, involving 12,777 faculty members over the six-year period of 2006-2011.&#160; It used the average number of citations of a school, department, or faculty member based on a search of Google News Archives then divided that number by the percentage a department or school has of total public funding listed by the National Science Foundation. <br/><br/>Schools with high rankings have comparatively high citation scores and low public funding scores.

<p>Five engaging documentary films will be presented, beginning at 6 p.m. The student filmmakers will each be in attendance and available after the screenings to discuss their films.</p>
<p>Admission is free, and the public is invited.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s Soc Doc cohort has created documentaries dealing with neglected and forgotten histories, such as Jack Chapman&#8217;s photographic and video work unearthing a journey of a radical American worker&#8217;s &#8220;army&#8221; in <strong><i>Bread or Blood</i></strong>, and Ricardo Velasco&#8217;s film,&#160;<strong><em>After the Crossfire</em></strong>, about memory, massacre and displacement in the remote village of Jurad&#243;, Colombia.</p>
<p>Marissa Kitazawa&#8217;s <strong><i>Legacy of Resilience</i></strong> traces the legacy of Japanese-American social engagement across generations, while Lena Jackson&#8217;s <strong><i>Crenshaw</i></strong> questions the cost of public school &#8220;reconstitution&#8221; to local community members in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong><i>Flatlands</i></strong>, Alex Melhuish&#8217;s bold documentary, follows the story of gun violence and survival in the Flatlands of East Oakland.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The work you will see is the culmination of an intense two years of immersion on the part of our students in documentary traditions and craft, scholarly research and analysis, aesthetic style, and fearless storytelling,&#8221; noted John Jota Lea&#241;os, Director of Graduate Studies and Associate Professor of Social Documentation.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, UCSC&#8217;s <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu/socdoc">Social Documentation Program</a> has paired film students with faculty in a wide variety of departments, enabling deep research into film subjects and the roots of complex issues and cultures.</p>
<p>Students in the program have earned grants and awards, distribution of their films, and festival exposure.</p>
<p>&#8221;These social documentaries demonstrate the work of engaged scholarship and represent a new generation of media makers,&#8221; said &#160;Lea&#241;os.</p>

Funded by a $1.5 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), the effort is intended to ensure that more of the students who enter UCSC planning to study science persist through the required courses to earn a science degree.</p>
<p>Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences at UCSC, will oversee the program and develop faculty teams to work on the different introductory course series.</p>
<p>"This grant gives us the resources we need to make the transition to new ways of teaching introductory science courses. It's a big step forward for the campus," Koch said. "Our goal is to use a more active learning approach--instead of lecturing, we will have students learn by doing. These curricular innovations can have an impact in increasing the number of students who get degrees in science."</p>
<p>In an approach known as "flipping the classroom," students will go online to access course material traditionally delivered in a lecture, while class time will be devoted to active learning through experiments, problem solving, and group projects.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was among 37 institutions to receive HHMI science education awards this year, out of 203 research universities invited to submit proposals (of which 170 submitted proposals). In announcing the awards, HHMI noted that most of the attrition from science majors occurs in the first two years of college, when students are taking introductory "gateway" courses.</p>
<p><strong>Above the national average</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is in a strong position to address the problem of student persistence in science and engineering, because the campus has an unusually good record of ensuring that its students earn degrees in the sciences. Nationally, only 40 percent of all undergraduates who begin college intending to major in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) complete a STEM degree. The persistence rate is even worse, only 20 percent, for students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. At UCSC, however, the persistence rate is 57 percent overall and 51 percent for underrepresented minority students, well above the national average.</p>
<p>"I see this grant as external verification that UCSC is a place that can have an impact on this pressing national problem," Koch said.</p>
<p>The faculty who will lead the development of the new introductory courses at UCSC are all experienced teachers with a commitment to innovative teaching methods. Seasoned faculty from four departments will be involved: Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Chemistry and Biochemistry; and Physics.</p>
<p>A new classroom will be needed that can accommodate as many as 125 students in an active learning environment, Koch said. Lecture halls with fixed seating won't work for classes in which students need to work together in groups and share their work with the rest of the class. The campus is exploring a location for the new classroom in the Science &amp; Engineering Library. "Classrooms like this are being built all over the country. We have a small one in McHenry Library, but it's not large enough for a big introductory science class," Koch said.</p>
<p>HHMI has supported other innovative science education programs at UCSC, including a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/05/2940.html">Phage Genomics course</a> for freshman biology students and an undergraduate research laboratory developed by Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, who received a $1 million grant as an <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2002/09/202.html">HHMI professor</a> in 2002. Compared to the earlier programs, the revamped introductory science courses will reach a much larger number of students, Koch said. The goal is to reach about 25 percent of the students taking these introductory science classes. The new courses will be launched over the next two years, with the first pilot courses planned for the 2015-16 academic year.</p>
<p>The new grant complements recent gifts to UCSC in support of the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/student-experience/">Student Experience Initiative</a> of the $300-million <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>. A $2 million <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/03/packard-foundation-gift.html">gift from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation</a> supports field-based active learning programs in environmental studies, and a $1 million <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/julie-packard-gift.html">gift from alumna Julie Packard</a> supports programs that help underrepresented minority students excel in the sciences and mathematics.</p>
<p>"The HHMI grant supports active learning in the classroom, which is known to level the playing field for all students," Koch said.</p>

<p>Since 1996, the European Association of Geochemistry and the <a href="http://www.geochemsoc.org/">Geochemical Society</a> have awarded the honorary title Geochemical Fellow to outstanding scientists who have made major contributions to the field of geochemistry. The 2014 Geochemical Fellows will be honored at the <a href="http://goldschmidt.info/2014/">Goldschmidt Conference</a> during a plenary session on Monday, June 9.</p>
<p>Paytan studies chemical and biological processes in the oceans, how they have changed over time, and how they are affected by human activities. Her research addresses a wide range of questions involving the global systems that affect ocean productivity, seawater chemistry, nutrient cycles, and water pollution. An over-arching goal of her lab's research is to link changes observed in the Earth and ocean systems to global changes in climate and tectonics, with an emphasis on human impacts.</p>
<p>Paytan is also dedicated to science education and outreach. She devotes time to develop and implement programs that enhance the process of learning science, expose students at all levels to the excitement of doing science, and introduce the relevance of science to real-world problems and current issues.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4f6ebabb807270461ae4b3b8334193f9"><name>hanes-football-helmet</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Oakes student's football helmet science project scores two White House visits</title><summary>A chance to visit the White House and chat with the president is a pretty big deal for most people, but UC Santa Cruz student Maria Hanes had the opportunity twice this week.</summary><start-date>1401498000000</start-date><display-name>Maria Hanes' White House visit</display-name><path>/2014/05/hanes-football-helmet</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/hanes-football-helmet</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1401491995283</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401897575949</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/hanes_wh_twitter-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/hanes_wh_twitter-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hanes_wh_twitter-350.jpg</name><display-name>hanes_wh_twitter-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>174599</file-size><width>350</width><height>497</height></image><image-alt>White House Twitter page</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/hanes-maria-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/hanes-maria-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hanes-maria-80.jpg</name><display-name>hanes-maria-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>26600</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Maria Hanes</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Oakes College first-year student Maria Hanes was featured on the Twitter feed of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy after her White House Science Fair visit Tuesday. Particular attention focused on her football-themed shoes. (Photo courtesy of the White House)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A chance to visit the White House and chat with the president is a pretty big deal for most people, but UC Santa Cruz student Maria Hanes had the opportunity twice this week.<br/><br/>First, the 19-year-old Oakes College freshman was invited to the White House Science Fair on Tuesday (May 27) to demonstrate her "Concussion Cushion," a rubberized covering for football helmets to lessen the impact to players' heads. She had created the science project last year as a high school senior and it won the top school and county prizes and placed in the 2013 California State Science Fair.<br/><br/>Then, President Obama invited her to return to the White House two days later for his summit on youth sports and concussions. The gathering was focused at finding new ways to identify, treat and prevent serious head injuries, particularly in youth sports.<br/><br/><strong>Football fanatic</strong></p>
<p>Hanes is a professed football fanatic who wants to become the first woman collegiate football coach. Her 18-year-old brother has suffered four concussions and can no longer play football.<br/><br/>Her project tests helmets with different inner and outer cushioning materials &#8212; including gel and memory foam and impact-absorbing outer coverings. The helmets are mounted on robots so they can be bashed together, testing the materials. The man who helped her obtain parts for the robots nominated her for the science fair, the fourth for the White House that this year focused on getting girls involved in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) fields. <br/><br/>Hanes is not a science major. She is planning on majoring in business management economics with a minor in technology management. She said she got the idea when she dropped her cell phone while bringing water to the football team at Desert High School on the Edwards Air Force Base where she was team manager for three years. <br/><br/>"I picked it up knowing it was completely fine, because I've dropped it 100 times. I said 'Hey what if we put something like this on helmets.'" <br/><br/><strong>Whirlwind week</strong></p>
<p>Her whirlwind week began with a phone call last week from her mom that the White House had invited her to attend the science fair. "I was on one of the school buses" when the call came, she said. "I cried."<br/><br/>First came a Greyhound bus ride back home to Lancaster, Calif. on Thursday the 22nd, then a Sunday flight to Washington, D.C. with her mom. <br/><br/>Hanes said she was at her exhibit in the White House Blue Room when she first spotted the president in the adjoining Red Room. "I was so nervous." But then Obama entered the room and walked right up to her and started talking about her project. <br/><br/>"He was so interested, genuinely interested, it made me feel so relaxed," she recalled. "We primarily talked about project, how I came up with it."<br/><br/>Then, she said, the president jokingly said, "stick around." <br/><br/>She and her mother were scheduled to fly back to California Tuesday evening and were able to squeeze in an interview with the <em>Washington Post</em>. The Associated Press had also featured her project as one of its examples in its article on the fair. <br/><br/>They were at the hotel getting ready to leave when the White House called again asking if they'd had a good day, and "'how would you like to come back Thursday,'" she said. &#160;<br/><br/>So it was two more days in DC and another visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., this time her seat was in the second row on the aisle. <br/><br/>She's now back in southern California, TV interviews are scheduled for the weekend, then back to Santa Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>Why UC Santa Cruz?</strong></p>
<p>Ok, we know what you're asking: What is an ardent football fan, who grew up in Oklahoma as a "huge Sooners fan" and wants to be a coach, doing at UC Santa Cruz, a campus that famously does not have a football team and has a banana slug as its mascot?<br/><br/>"Let's put it this way, I got a good offer," Hanes said. <br/><br/>At first she wasn't sure she made the right choice in coming to UCSC.&#160; But "after my second quarter, I fell in love with it. I love UCSC. I love Santa Cruz," she said.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>And her past week in Washington, meeting President Obama, and congress members, and other assorted "important people?"</p>

Regrettably, there have been disturbing reports of race-related incidents recently, and I write to remind you about campus resources that are available to all.<br/><br/>Hate- and bias-related incidents are painful to experience and will not be tolerated here at UC Santa Cruz. We have initiated, as required by university policy, a full review of what occurred and intend to hold individuals accountable, where warranted, for their actions. In addition, the Dean of Students has asked the African American Resource and Cultural Center (AARCC) to host a town hall meeting as soon as possible to provide a forum where students, staff, and faculty can share their thoughts and concerns.<br/><br/>The UCSC Principles of Community articulate our campus commitment to creating an environment that values and supports everyone. To that end, we are committed to enforcing policies regarding hate/bias incidents, as well as sexual assault, sexual harassment, and the conduct of students, faculty, and staff. These incidents have no place on our campus. Thankfully, such incidents are rare, yet swift reporting and response is key when they do occur.<br/><br/>If you believe you have witnessed, or that you have been a target of, a hate- or bias-motivated incident on campus or while participating in a university-sponsored activity, please bring the incident to the attention of campus officials. You may report incidents directly to the UCSC Police Department, or online through the <a href="http://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/">Student Judicial Affairs</a> hate- or bias-motivated incident <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu/how-to-report/online-report-form.html">reporting form</a> or the UC systemwide <a href="https://ucsystems.ethicspointvp.com/custom/ucs_ccc/">Climate Issues Reporting System</a>. We accept anonymous reports and endeavor to respect the rights of privacy of all individuals involved in accordance with the law.<br/><br/>We take every report seriously. On campus, our <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu/response-team/index.html">Hate Bias Response Team</a> responds within two business days, investigating each report as appropriate and offering support to affected individuals to facilitate the healing process.

<p>Chancellor George Blumenthal hosted a private luncheon at the University House for this year&#8217;s recipients of the Chancellor&#8217;s Awards, recognizing exceptional achievement in undergraduate research projects and other creative activities.&#160;<a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/">A full list of the honorees</a>&#160;and their mentors shows that the winners have a wide range of interests from silent movies filmed in Santa Cruz to dental robotics techniques.</p>
<p>The event concluded with the announcement of this year&#8217;s Steck Family Award&#8212;a special honor for the year's most outstanding senior thesis. &#160;This year's Steck Family Award honoree is UC Santa Cruz senior Beau Norgeot, who used computer analysis to craft a drug to make cells more receptive to chemotherapy. This week, the&#160;<a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/santacruz/ci_25915856/ucsc-student-honored-designing-cancer-drug">Santa Cruz Sentinel profiled Norgeot and described the unusual collaboration at the heart of his work</a>. He was honored along with his faculty mentors David Bernick and Glenn Millhauser.</p>
<p>Loren Steck (Porter '73), a UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee, has described the award as a truly special honor for UCSC students: "Only the best undergraduates nowadays do senior theses," Steck said. "Only the best of the best of them receive Dean&#8217;s Awards. Only the best of the best of the best of them get Chancellor&#8217;s Awards."</p>
<p>Steck chairs the distinguished selection committee. The Steck family created the endowment that funds the award.</p>
<p>As usual, the identity of the Steck honoree was a closely guarded secret right up to the end of the ceremony.</p>
<p>These honors showcase two enduring values at UCSC&#8212;the focus on transformative undergraduate experiences on campus, and the importance of research as part of the learning process.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/beau-.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/beau-.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>beau-.jpg</name><display-name>beau-.jpg</display-name><file-size>11539</file-size><width>208</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>BEAU NORGEOT</title><description>This year's Steck Family Award honoree is UC Santa Cruz senior Beau Norgeot, who used computer analysis to craft a drug to make cells more receptive to chemotherapy.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="77d355808072704607f15f7fd8760a1d"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2014/05/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/05/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1389284775271</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1389284775271</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
