Managers: Please post a paper copy of this message in your area for people who do not have regular computer access.</em><br/><br/>I am pleased to announce the appointment of Tracey Tsugawa as the new campus Title IX Officer, overseeing our compliance with federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education. <br/><br/>Title IX forbids sex discrimination, including sexual harassment and assault, and exclusion on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. At UC Santa Cruz, Title IX applies to all university student services and academic programs, from admissions, athletics, and academic advising to financial aid, grading, and discipline. It also forbids sex discrimination in employment and recruitment.<br/><br/>Tsugawa will also direct the new Discrimination and Harassment Prevention and Investigation Unit of the campus Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. This unit will investigate all discrimination and harassment-related complaints and grievances filed by students, staff, and academic employees, as well as the public. The unit will also oversee compliance with mandatory Title IX-related training and be involved in other discrimination and harassment prevention efforts. <br/><br/>Tracey grew up in Santa Cruz and is returning to the Central Coast after 24 years. She comes to UC Santa Cruz from the Vermont Human Rights Commission, where she worked as a civil rights investigator and trainer. Her areas of specialization in Vermont included school bullying and harassment, disability accessibility, and refugee and immigrant issues. <br/><br/>Tracey is also a dedicated educator with almost three decades of graduate and undergraduate teaching experience at colleges and universities in Vermont and Massachusetts. She has taught courses on cross-cultural studies, ethics and leadership, workplace conflict, organizational development, diversity and equity in the workplace, women's studies, Asian American studies, and environmental justice. She has also worked as a diversity/cultural competency trainer and consultant for public and private organizations. She has a B.A. from Oberlin College and a M.Ed. from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.<br/><br/>I want to thank Tracey's predecessor, Rita Walker, the campus's founding Title IX officer, who did an outstanding job serving our campus and the UC system during her 21-year tenure. Rita is now enjoying her well-deserved retirement.<br/><br/>Tracey's first day on campus was August 25. Please join me in welcoming her to UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>------<br/><br/></p>

Your patience during the past several weeks has been greatly appreciated. Here is an update on the status of the project as of Wednesday morning, September 3rd.<br/><br/>Paving of both the Oakes Road and Heller Drive between College Eight and Meyer Drive is now underway, with completion expected by the end of this week. Roadway striping on both these roads and elsewhere is scheduled to occur late next week.<br/><br/>Work at the Heller/McLaughlin intersection will begin on Wednesday, September 10th. While contractors will maintain one lane of travel through the intersection, motor vehicles should anticipate delays. During this time, the Core West Parking Structure will be accessible only from the east emergency entrance from Steinhart Drive near the Physical Sciences Building. Detour signage will be in place to direct traffic away from the usual entrance from Heller Drive to the temporary entrance from Steinhart Drive that day.<br/><br/>The Hagar Drive roadbed rehabilitation continues this week, with the most severe delays expected on Thursday and Friday, September 4th and 5th. Traffic control will be in place, resulting in continued delays for vehicles accessing Hahn, Quarry Plaza, OPERS, and other adjacent facilities. <strong>Expect longer delays while paving operations are underway</strong>. If possible, traffic should avoid the Hagar corridor completely.&#160; Paving along Hagar Drive should be completed by the middle of next week.<br/><br/>A map illustrating these construction locations is available here: <a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/construction-2014-map.pdf">http://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/construction-2014-map.pdf</a><br/><br/>Most of the roadwork should be completed by Friday, September 12th, with all work scheduled for completion by Friday, September 19th.<br/><br/>As always, drivers are urged to use caution when traveling through these project corridors, especially when construction workers are present.<br/><br/>Questions about the 2014 Road Rehabilitation Project should be directed to Damon Adlao, Project Manager with Physical Plant, at 459-2338.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Larry Pageler, TAPS Director; Henry Salameh, Physical Plant Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3d820178807270466b1f05a1cde69b2f"><name>east-field-closure</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Closure of Upper East Field</title><summary>Beginning September 2, 2014, the Upper East Field has been closed and is expected to remain closed until at least June 1, 2015. </summary><start-date>1409727600000</start-date><display-name>Closure of Upper East Field</display-name><path>/2014/09/east-field-closure</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/east-field-closure</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1409781203273</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1411756680633</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Beginning&#160;September 2, 2014, the Upper East Field has been closed and is expected to remain closed until&#160;at least June 1, 2015.</p>
<p>A campus-wide water-working group has been meeting since February to prioritize water use on campus to comply with the Stage 3 Water Emergency declared by the City of Santa Cruz. As a result of campus water-rationing efforts, irrigation to the Upper East Field was reduced by 45 percent beginning&#160;May 1, 2014. While every effort was made to maintain the integrity of the field, without adequate irrigation, the field&#160;has deteriorated rapidly.</p>
<p>In consultation with Physical Plant, OPERS&#160;has decided to close the field to prevent further damage to the turf and structure of the field and prevent participant injury until the field can be restored.&#160; The field closure represents the need to begin to address the long-term implications of the severe drought in California and future sustainable practices for water use. OPERS will be enforcing the following programming modifications and policies for the 2014-15 academic year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intramural sports that used to be held on the East Field will be cancelled and alternate sports will be offered in the OPERS facilities that are available.</li>
<li>Practice times available for NCAA teams and sports clubs will be reviewed and reduced times will be allotted on the Lower East Field and West Field.</li>
<li>Requests for field rentals from non-campus groups will not be accepted for the 2014-15 academic year.</li>
</ul>

A new analysis of this record shows that species extinctions, probably caused by a drying climate and growing human population in the region, have made the ecosystem progressively less stable.</p>
<p>The study, published September 8 in <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</i>, found that local extinctions of mammal species led to a steady decline in the stability of the animal communities in the Nile Valley. When there were many species in the community, the loss of any one species had relatively little impact on the functioning of the ecosystem, whereas it is now much more sensitive to perturbations, according to first author Justin Yeakel, who worked on the study as a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.</p>
<p>Around six millennia ago, there were 37 species of large-bodied mammals in Egypt, but only eight species remain today. Among the species recorded in artwork from the late Predynastic Period (before 3100 BC) but no longer found in Egypt are lions, wild dogs, elephants, oryx, hartebeest, and giraffe.</p>
<p>"What was once a rich and diverse mammalian community is very different now," Yeakel said. "As the number of species declined, one of the primary things that was lost was the ecological redundancy of the system. There were multiple species of gazelles and other small herbivores, which are important because so many different predators prey on them. When there are fewer of those small herbivores, the loss of any one species has a much greater effect on the stability of the system and can lead to additional extinctions."</p>
<p>The new study is based on records compiled by zoologist Dale Osborne, whose 1998 book <i>The Mammals of Ancient Egypt</i> provides a detailed picture of the region's historical animal communities based on archaeological and paleontological evidence as well as historical records. "Dale Osborne compiled an incredible database of when species were represented in artwork and how that changed over time. His work allowed us to use ecological modeling techniques to look at the ramifications of those changes," Yeakel said.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Tutankhamun exhibit</strong></p>
<p>The study had its origins in 2010, when Yeakel visited a Tutankhamun exhibition in San Francisco with coauthor Nathaniel Dominy, then an anthropology professor at UC Santa Cruz and now at Dartmouth. "We were amazed at the artwork and the depictions of animals, and we realized they were recording observations of the natural world. Nate was aware of Dale Osborne's book, and we started thinking about how we could take advantage of those records," Yeakel said.</p>
<p>Coauthor Paul Koch, a UCSC paleontologist who studies ancient ecosystems, helped formulate the team's approach to using the records to look at the ecological ramifications of the changes in species occurrences. Yeakel teamed up with ecological modelers Mathias Pires of the University of Sao Paolo, Brazil, and Lars Rudolf of the University of Bristol, U.K., to do a computational analysis of the dynamics of predator-prey networks in the ancient Egyptian animal communities.</p>
<p>The researchers identified five episodes over the past 6,000 years when dramatic changes occurred in Egypt's mammalian community, three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions. These drying periods also coincided with upheaval in human societies, such as the collapse of the Old Kingdom around 4,000 years ago and the fall of the New Kingdom about 3,000 years ago.</p>
<p>"There were three large pulses of aridification as Egypt went from a wetter to a drier climate, starting with the end of the African Humid Period 5,500 years ago when the monsoons shifted to the south," Yeakel said. "At the same time, human population densities were increasing, and competition for space along the Nile Valley would have had a large impact on animal populations."</p>
<p>The most recent major shift in mammalian communities occurred about 100 years ago. The analysis of predator-prey networks showed that species extinctions in the past 150 years had a disproportionately large impact on ecosystem stability. These findings have implications for understanding modern ecosystems, Yeakel said.</p>
<p>"This may be just one example of a larger pattern," he said. "We see a lot of ecosystems today in which a change in one species produces a big shift in how the ecosystem functions, and that might be a modern phenomenon. We don't tend to think about what the system was like 10,000 years ago, when there might have been greater redundancy in the community."</p>
<p>In addition to Yeakel, Pires, Rudolf, Dominy, and Koch, the coauthors of the paper include Thilo Gross at the University of Bristol and Paulo Guimaraes at the University of Sao Paolo.

But according to Marilyn Walker, professor of computer science at UC Santa Cruz, natural language processing is now so good that the failure of these systems to respond in a natural way has become glaringly obvious.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are starting to notice that the system isn&#8217;t saying anything back,&#8221; said Walker, whose research includes work on spoken dialogue systems as well as research on extending the language capabilities of interactive games, with a focus on training, assistive, and educational games.</p>
<p>Walker has graduate degrees in both computer science and linguistics, and she is interested in how people adapt their language to their conversation partners. Word choice and sentence construction can reveal aspects of each speaker&#8217;s personality, as well as the social relationship between the speakers. The challenge is to develop software that can recognize and respond to the nuances of human conversation, altering its responses based on how the user talks to it.</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing sarcasm</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, such technology could be used to create companion robots, navigation programs, or restaurant recommendation software that interact with us more naturally. But first, researchers need to learn more about the natural patterns of human dialogue and develop computer programs that can recognize things like sarcasm. One of Walker's current projects, funded last year by the National Science Foundation, involves an interdisciplinary team of UCSC researchers, including psychologists and linguists. The group is analyzing posts from online debate forums to learn how people use language to make arguments.</p>
<p>The team has gathered more than 26,000 dialogues from three online debate forums. They have crowd-sourced summaries of a selection of conversations about topics involving ideological arguments, like abortion, healthcare, and the death penalty. They also are also looking at playful debates about the merits of cats compared to dogs, and debates over technical topics, like preferences in web browsing software.</p>
<p>Walker said she is interested in learning more about how people use sarcasm in a conversation, and she's curious about how people present facts to support their arguments. To learn about these elements, the researchers are carefully annotating the online posts to uncover patterns in word choice and sentence construction. These patterns can be particularly tricky to find amidst quirky grammar and misspelled words common to the informal conversation of social media. The researchers plan to use the data they've gathered from summarizations and annotations to build a program that can identify sarcasm, report a poster's stance on a topic, and identify the arguments and counter-arguments for a particular topic.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Varied perspectives</strong></p>
<p>The software could also sift through comments or forum posts to identify people's varied perspectives on a particular topic. Pranav Anand, professor of linguistics at UC Santa Cruz and a co-investigator on the project, said that such a program could provide a digest or snapshot of what people have to say. "As someone who looks through comments for content, I think an end user would really appreciate that. A person would never be able to read all the comments," he said.</p>
<p>According to Walker, a program like this could also be useful as an educational tool. Psychological evidence suggests that a debate becomes less polarized if people are exposed to multiple arguments.</p>
<p>Other researchers on the grant include Jean E. Fox Tree and Steve Whittaker, both professors of psychology at UC Santa Cruz. Walker <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/project/skipper">previously collaborated</a> with Fox Tree on a project to learn more about language variation while giving directions. The researchers sent students to view public art in downtown Santa Cruz. Other students on campus helped the first group navigate the art walk by providing directions and descriptions of the artwork.</p>
<p>The researchers were interested in how descriptions or directions varied whether the team were friends or strangers. Friends, for example, may abbreviate directions because they can anticipate what their partner will do.</p>
<p>What if navigation systems in cars could learn what kinds of routes you like or common ways you get to main roads? If the system adapts its directions to your preferences, Walker imagines drivers might not want to change car brands when it comes time to buy a new car because they don&#8217;t want to lose their relationship with their navigation system.</p>
<p>By changing how computers talk to us, it may create an unspoken relationship that strengthens our connections to devices.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="65b85f2f807270466b1f05a1dd917ca5"><name>julie-packard-profile</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Julie Packard: Philanthropy and pragmatism </title><summary>Alumna (Crown '74, biology; M.A. '78) talks about investing in passion, working to make change, and expanding world views through the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</summary><keywords>Julie Packard, Dean's Fund for Diversity in the Sciences, Monterey Bay Aquarium</keywords><start-date>1410418800000</start-date><display-name>Julie Packard: Philanthropy and pragmatism </display-name><path>/2014/09/julie-packard-profile</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/julie-packard-profile</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1410455854831</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1410473769696</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/packard-julie-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/packard-julie-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>packard-julie-300.jpg</name><display-name>packard-julie-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>114431</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt>Julie Packard (Photo by Tom O'Neal/Monterey Bay Aquarium)</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/packard-julie-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/packard-julie-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>packard-julie-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>packard-julie-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24025</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Julie Packard (Photo by Tom O'Neal/Monterey Bay Aquarium)</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p><span>Alumna Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, recently gave UC Santa Cruz a $1 million gift,&#160;establishing the Dean's Fund for Diversity in the Sciences.

<p>"There was no talking because everyone was barely conscious," says Packard. "It would be some ridiculously early hour. We would put on hip waders and walk across the beach in the beginning light."</p>
<p>There, Packard would join other students on their hands and knees, combing through the icy water of the intertidal zone, recording plants and animals as part of a study being done on the impact of humans on the environment along the Central California coast.</p>
<p>"When the tide went out, it was like the ocean was receding to reveal this hidden treasure," says the now 61-year-old Packard, her voice tinged with the lingering pleasure of those days. "It was like a treasure chest. You never knew what you would find."</p>
<p>"Julie excelled at everything," says Doyle, who was founding director of UC Santa Cruz's Institute of Marine Sciences (and is now 85). "She was able to synthesize and ask great questions. She had a wide-open, inquisitive mind."</p>
<p>It is that wide-open mind, nurtured by her father, the high-tech pioneer David Packard, that seems to be a hallmark of Packard's life.</p>
<p>It leads her on walks through the halls of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, where she is executive director, to observe whether visitors are absorbing the message of conservation or whether they're only seeing cute sea otters playing in their rocky pond.</p>
<p>It leads her to delight in the identification of plants as she hikes in the Sierra, to live in the countryside, and to believe that philanthropy shouldn't be based on a model of business outcomes but rather about investing in passionate people and new ideas.</p>
<p>"My philosophy is that you need to work to make a change," says Packard, who is on the board of the $6.5-billion David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which handed out $288 million in grants last year. "Whether you go to a protest march or write your senator or write a check. I think all of us need to engage."</p>
<p>Packard (Crown '74, biology; M.A. '78) is a tall, lithe woman who walks with an easy confidence. She has chin-length silver hair and intelligent brown eyes that don't miss much of what is going on around her. Still, her concentration is near total in conversation with someone.</p>
<p>Her stories tell of an upbringing that was more outdoorsy and down-to-earth than what might be imagined for the scion of the Hewlett-Packard fortune. She grew up amid apricot and plum orchards in the Santa Clara Valley, joining her father to plant a vegetable garden each year and traveling to the San Felipe Ranch east of San Jose on weekends, where she rode horses, herded cattle, and wandered the property's 28,539 acres of grassland and oak.</p>
<p>"I was very inquisitive. I was always asking a lot of questions about nature and spending a lot of time outdoors," Packard says.</p>
<p>It was natural then, when it came time for college, that Packard chose to study science at UC Santa Cruz, a college on the forefront of the environmental studies movement.</p>
<p>Arriving on campus in a battered old Ford Bronco from the family orchard, Packard was soon tromping through the Sierra on research expeditions, exploring the ocean's intertidal zone, and spending hours in the lab. Although Doyle described her as a "quiet leader" and urged her to get her Ph.D., Packard said she wasn't cut out for research and teaching.</p>
<p>"I was more interested in connecting science with environmental action and environmental solutions," she says.</p>
<p>And it was the ocean that interested Packard most. "The oceans are a huge part of life and, yet, no one was paying attention to them," she says.</p>
<p>With the Packard wealth and her family behind the undertaking&#8212;Packard's sister, Nancy Burnett, has a degree in marine biology and her father helped design the plant's pumps, filters, and tanks&#8212;Packard was soon at the helm of the newly built Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p>
<p>Last year, nearly 2 million people wandered through its halls, staring into the light-speckled depths of a kelp forest, watching jellyfish bloom into fanciful shapes, and connecting to the ocean's complex underwater world while, behind the scenes, scientists labored on research projects.</p>
<p>With 80,000 schoolchildren visiting each year and an innovative Seafood Watch program that helps consumers make environmentally conscious seafood choices, TripAdvisor named the facility "The Best Aquarium in the World," this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the aquarium's sister organization in Moss Landing&#8212;the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), which still receives up to 80 percent of its funding from the Packard Foundation&#8212;remains at the forefront of ocean research including development of high-tech exploration equipment.</p>
<p>All of this is a concrete monument to the philanthropy and pragmatism that run deep in the Packard blood.</p>
<p>"My father was a very practical person and not really a dreamer," remembers Packard of the man who co-founded Hewlett-Packard. "He was always, 'Let's cut to the chase here, guys.' I value that about him."</p>
<p>Philanthropy, she says, was also an early value, inculcated even before David Packard grew wealthy.</p>
<p>"Having resources to share is a gift, an opportunity," Packard says of the ability to hand out millions of dollars to foundations and programs. "It's satisfying to be able to influence things you think are important."</p>
<p>But a big checkbook isn't the only answer, she says, leaning forward to make her point. Change can come from acts as simple as voting, from putting social media pressures on government, from volunteering, from standing up for what you believe. "I think all of us need to engage," she says.</p>
<p>This year, Packard also made her own $1 million gift to UC Santa Cruz to establish the Dean's Fund for Diversity in the Sciences, designed to support programs that will help underrepresented minority students excel in science and math. Packard believes it's critical for the sciences to reflect the diversity of California's population, especially with so many pivotal environmental decisions ahead. This year, 10 students already received scholarships to a summer research program on campus thanks to a portion of her gift.</p>
<p>Glancing at her watch, already a little behind schedule for a Bay Area meeting, Packard tells a final story about why the aquarium and the foundation's work are so important to her.</p>
<p>She was coming in from an outside deck at the aquarium, she says, when she held open the door for a woman and her pre-teen girl.</p>

<p>Lea&#241;os&#8217;s film is featured in a month-long series of original programming on PBS that will be available for <a href="http://video.pbs.org/video/2365322372/">online viewing</a>, beginning on September 15.</p>
<p><i>Frontera! Revolt and Rebellion on the R&#237;o Grande </i>is a wildly original look at the history of the deeply contested U.S.-Mexico borderlands.</p>
<p>The 20-minute film is a documentary animation&#160;chronicling the events leading to the&#160;1680 Pueblo Revolt in what is now Arizona and New Mexico.</p>
<p>According to Lea&#241;os, Native Pueblo scholars cite this historical occurrence as the "First American Revolution," a moment when the Pueblo people orchestrated the unthinkable--an uprising by regional Indian tribes that successfully expelled their Spanish occupiers from the entire Rio Grande region, leading to an indigenous cultural and social renaissance.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I merge the genres of animation and documentary to tell a story that has been largely ignored in the making of America's master narrative,&#8221; said Lea&#241;os. &#8220;I use colorful cartoons, rap music, and animated narrators to document a complex, multivocal history.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important for Native, Chicano, Latino, and other colonized communities to see these stories of triumph, struggle, and resistance in fresh and creative ways,&#8221; added Lea&#241;os.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is especially important for us to learn alternative perspectives in history--ones that show us that transformation and change is possible through negotiation, communication and collective action." &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Although Lea&#241;os wrote</strong>, directed, produced, and animated<strong> </strong><i>Frontera!</i>, he noted that the film is a collaboration between mestizo and Native American artists from California and New Mexico. Prominent scholars also served as consultants and script advisors on the project.</p>
<p>The film took four years to complete. The first two years were mainly spent on research and collaboration with Pueblo Indian leaders and Chicano artists about the story and its significance. Once in production, the animation took about a year to finish.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has an original score by Crist&#243;bal Mart&#237;nez (Alcalde), a member of the acclaimed Native artist collective, Post-Commodity,&#8221; said Lea&#241;os. &#8220;The rap song in the film was created by Deuce Eclipse, Greg Landau, and myself, and can be downloaded as an mp3,&#8221; he added.&#160;</p>
<p>The film has previously been screened at select Native and Latino film festivals, winning the "Best Short Film" Award at the XicanIndie Film Festival in Denver earlier this year. Lea&#241;os noted it will also be screened at the San Francisco Latino Film Festival, as well as play at several academic conferences presented by such groups as the American Anthropological Association (AAA) and the American Folklore Society.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/02/leanos-transit-video.html</url><title>UCSC film professor creates video to address LA public health crisis</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/09/leanos-chicago-museum.html</url><title>Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago presents work of John Jota Leaños</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/guggenheim-jota.html</url><title>UCSC film professor John Jota Leaños wins 2012 Guggenheim Fellowship </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6bb42cd7807270466b1f05a1b7e1691f"><name>merrill-parking</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Parking at Merrill Lot 119 </title><summary>Renovation-related grading and paving work is taking place in portions of Merrill Lot 119 from now until Move In (September 26th).</summary><start-date>1410505200000</start-date><display-name>Parking at Merrill Lot 119 </display-name><path>/2014/09/merrill-parking</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/merrill-parking</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1410556243118</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1410556281758</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Renovation-related grading and paving work is taking place in portions of Merrill Lot 119 from now until Move In (September 26th).

The Aleutians, the Gal&#225;pagos, the Falklands, Hawaii, and countless other archipelagoes have seen species such as rats, goats, brown tree snakes, and exotic grasses delivered by human visitors. Many of the newcomers have flourished to the point of driving unique island species extinct.</p>
<p>People are now trying to reverse the damage of these ill-advised translocations. Step one is obvious: eradicate the invaders. Step two, however, isn&#8217;t so clear. Experts argue over whether expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive &#160;restoration is necessary, or if simply removing non-natives is enough.</p>
<p>Now a study set in California&#8217;s Channel Islands indicates eradication alone can jumpstart recovery. Led by two UC Santa Cruz undergraduates, the research shows native shrubs reclaiming the island on their own nearly three decades after removal of sheep and other grazers. The study is published in the journal <em><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rec.12144/abstract">Restoration Ecology</a></em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking out those sheep triggered a large change in the vegetation; it was going from grassland back to coyote brush or California sage, to a more diverse community,&#8221; said Nissa Kreidler, one of the study&#8217;s student authors.</p>
<p>&#8220;People spend millions of dollars on restoring island ecosystems. So it&#8217;s a huge finding that passive recovery can be sufficient and under certain circumstances, active restoration is sometimes not necessary,&#8221; said Roxanne Beltran, the paper&#8217;s lead author.</p>
<p><b>Intensive supercourse</b></p>
<p>The paper grew out of an assignment in the Conservation and Ecology in Practice &#8220;supercourse&#8221; both students took in spring 2012. Taught primarily by UCSC professors Don Croll (ecology and evolutionary biology) and Erika Zavaleta (environmental studies), and UCSC Natural Reserve System director Gage Dayton, the class spends the entire quarter learning techniques for ecological and conservation research while visiting the protected wildlands of the <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/">UC Natural Reserve System</a>. Students read previous research pertaining to local ecology and management, then design and conduct their own short-term field studies.</p>
<p>On Santa Cruz Island Reserve, humans have had a major impact on land conditions. The first sheep arrived 150 years ago, to be joined by cattle, horses, and feral pigs. These large herbivores completely denuded some areas, and transformed others into non-native grassland.</p>
<p>The effort to eradicate sheep, cattle, and horses from the island began in 1981 and was largely complete by 1999; feral pigs were eliminated by 2007. Then the land was left alone. At nearly 100 square miles in size, Santa Cruz Island is far too large to actively replant native vegetation.</p>
<p>Initially, removing grazers caused unforeseen consequences. Ten years on, non-native grasses had taken over a larger share of the island. Dirk Van Vuren, now an ecology professor at UC Davis, documented that initial shift in the late 1980s and again in the 1990s. He compared the plants on either side of a sheep exclusion fence using photos and vegetation transects.</p>
<p>While deciding on a class project for the island, Beltran said, &#8220;we looked at his old black-and-white photos and saw herbivores had caused more damage than we could see currently. We decided to see exactly how much the island had recovered passively.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Promising results</b></p>
<p>The results were so promising that Beltran and Kreidler decided to develop them into a publishable paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;We said, we can do this,&#8221; Kreidler recalls. &#8220;The supercourse had given us the tools. We knew how to design a project, run the statistics, talk with other people, and collaborate to write a paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>That research confidence did not arrive by accident; it&#8217;s what the supercourse was designed to do. &#8220;We have them do study after study; when they&#8217;re done with the quarter they&#8217;ve finished five, one on each reserve they&#8217;ve visited. They are constantly writing up their work and getting more efficient at study design and data collection. It takes the mystery out of doing research, and they&#8217;re not afraid to try things and make mistakes,&#8221; instructor Croll said.</p>
<p>For her part, Beltran saw a chance to join the scientific community. &#8220;I had done a lot of learning and practicing to be a scientist through lessons and assignments. But Gage, Don, and Erika made it really clear that we all had the capability to take the next step, to do research on our own, and to make contributions in our field. They wanted us to find an important question that had implications other people would be interested in,&#8221; Beltran said.</p>
<p>The students started by contacting Dirk Van Vuren, the author of the earlier study. He shared topographic maps of his photo and vegetation transect locations as well as the historic photos themselves.</p>
<p>The students and their fellow supercourse participants, Mickie Tang, Zoe Wedel, and Jared Anderson-Huxley, set out for the island that summer to update Van Vuren&#8217;s study. They received research funding from UC Santa Cruz through the <a href="http://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/">Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a>, the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu">STEM Diversity Program</a>, and the <a href="http://ucsantacruz.ucnrs.org/">UCSC Natural Reserve System</a>.</p>
<p><b>Rugged terrain</b></p>
<p>Their week and a half on the island proved unexpectedly rocky. While the students had translated Van Vuren&#8217;s map locations into GPS coordinates, they hadn&#8217;t counted on how difficult it would be to reach each site. &#8220;We could see the places we needed to go in Google Earth, and the route to each site looked fine from satellite images. But one was in a huge ditch, another on top of the mountain, and we didn&#8217;t realize how crazy the roads were,&#8221; Beltran said.</p>
<p>Reserve manager Lyndal Laughrin volunteered to drive the team around, allowing them to sidestep a rugged trek up 2,800-foot Diablo Peak. &#8220;He saved us,&#8221; Beltran said. Even so, scrambling down cliffs and ducking around the barbed-wire sheep fence left the students scraped and bloody.</p>
<p>Back in Santa Cruz, the students compared photos shot from the same island vantage points in the early 1980s, late 1990s, and 2012. They found large areas once occupied by grasses replaced by woody shrubs, a shift that nearly doubles the amount of carbon stored on the island. Places grazed down to bare soil were being recolonized by plants, reducing soil erosion.</p>
<p>The vegetation transects told a similar story. The land area covered by grasses dropped by half, with native coastal sage scrub making equivalent gains. Aerial surveys and vegetation maps of the island from The Nature Conservancy, which manages the land, provided additional evidence of these changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty years after eradication, we&#8217;ve shown there is enough resilience for the vegetation to restore itself,&#8221; said Croll, a coauthor on the paper. &#8220;The findings help set expectations on how long recovery can take. Funders want immediate results. But sometimes it&#8217;s worthwhile to take the time to wait rather than incur the huge expense of active restoration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both students say they gained a great deal from writing the paper. &#8220;It&#8217;s very different than writing a paper you think your teachers would like. I developed a new appreciation for what it takes to be a scientist,&#8221; Kreidler said.</p>
<p><strong>Go-getters</strong></p>
<p>Publishing a paper based on supercourse research is nearly unheard of, Croll said. &#8220;Roxanne and Nissa have been really motivated across the board. They&#8217;re not your average undergraduates; they&#8217;re go-getters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kreidler graduated from UCSC in 2012. She has gone on to run Save The Bay&#8217;s volunteer-based restoration program. While replanting San Francisco Bay shorelines with native plants, she talks with thousands of local residents about issues such as pollution and climate change in the region. Kreidler plans to go to graduate school to study conservation.</p>
<p>For her part, Beltran started volunteering at the NRS&#8217;s <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/ano_nuevo/ano_nuevo.htm">A&#241;o Nuevo Island Reserve</a> working on elephant seals alongside Dan Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. She discovered her passion was marine mammals and, after graduating in 2013, landed a coveted spot in graduate school at the University of Alaska. She now conducts her doctoral research on the world&#8217;s southernmost mammal, the Weddell seal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been my dream to go to Antarctica since I can remember. One reason I worked so hard as an undergraduate was to realize that goal,&#8221; Beltran said. Now she flies to McMurdo Station twice a year, where she gets to see curious penguins waddling around her equipment and minke whales spyhopping on her from water holes in the ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The field courses I took made me a much more competitive applicant for graduate school, and volunteering helped me find what I wanted to work on,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;It was a really fortunate combination of identifying what I wanted to do and making myself competitive enough to do it.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="85a497de807270466b1f05a1e00c03b8"><name>harfest</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renowned astronomer Harland Epps to be honored at ‘Harfest’ conference Sept. 23-24</title><summary>Leading astronomers from around the world will gather to honor UC Santa Cruz astronomer Harland W.

Epps, who retired in July.</p>
<p>Epps, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics, has been at the forefront of designing optics for astronomical instruments for more than 50 years. His optics have been applied to instruments on several&#160;major telescopes worldwide, including the world&#8217;s largest telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.</p>
<p>"Harland's retirement this past July caps a brilliant career, leading the world's astronomical community in the design and construction of state-of-the-art instrumentation for ground-based and space-based astronomy,&#8221; said Steve Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and chair of the Harfest organizing committee.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career,&#160;Epps has designed optics for more than 50 instruments. Recently, he completed the optics for the Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE), a fully cryogenic near-infrared spectrograph that is currently operational on the Keck I telescope in Hawaii. This instrument is designed to probe some of the most distant objects in the universe.</p>
<p>&#8220;His optical design work has revolutionized observational astronomy, and is the unseen &#8216;wind beneath the wings&#8217; of countless exciting astronomy news stories the public has enjoyed over the past four decades,"&#160;said Vogt.</p>
<p>Epps&#8217; optical designs serve telescopes including the Shane Telescope at the nearby Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory, the Keck Telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) at the Whipple Observatory in Arizona, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at the McDonald Observatory in Texas, and others.</p>
<p>Many of Epps&#8217; optics support international telescopes as well, including the SOAR telescope at Cerro Pachon, the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, and the SALT telescope in South Africa.</p>
<p>In August 2014, Epps was honored by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific with the Muhlmann Award in recognition of his career in instrumentation.&#160;</p>
<p>The "Harfest" conference will commence on Tuesday, September 23, with a full day of scientific talks, followed by a banquet celebrating Epps&#8217; many accomplishments.</p>
<p>Talks will continue on September 24, followed by a wine tasting sponsored by former UC Observatories Director Joe Miller.</p>

Epigenetic modifications do not affect the DNA sequence of genes, but change how the DNA is packaged and how genes are expressed. Now, a study by scientists at UC Santa Cruz shows how epigenetic memory can be passed across generations and from cell to cell during development.</p>
<p>The study, published September 19 in <i>Science</i>, focused on one well studied epigenetic modification--the methylation of a DNA packaging protein called histone H3. Methylation of a particular amino acid (lysine 27) in histone H3 is known to turn off or "repress" genes, and this epigenetic mark is found in all multicellular animals, from humans to the tiny roundworm <i>C. elegans</i> that was used in this study.</p>
<p><strong>Ongoing debate</strong></p>
<p>"There has been ongoing debate about whether the methylation mark can be passed on through cell divisions and across generations, and we've now shown that it is," said corresponding author Susan Strome, a professor of molecular, cell and developmental biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Strome's lab created worms with a mutation that knocks out the enzyme responsible for making the methylation mark, then bred them with normal worms. Using fluorescent labels, they were able to track the fates of marked and unmarked chromosomes under the microscope, from egg cells and sperm to the dividing cells of embryos after fertilization. Embryos from mutant egg cells fertilized by normal sperm had six methylated chromosomes (from the sperm) and six unmarked or "naked" chromosomes (from the egg).</p>
<p>As embryos develop, the cells replicate their chromosomes and divide. The researchers found that when a marked chromosome replicates, the two daughter chromosomes are both marked. But without the enzyme needed for histone methylation, the marks become progressively diluted with each cell division.</p>
<p>"The mark stays on the chromosomes derived from the initial chromosome that had the mark, but there's not enough mark for both daughter chromosomes to be fully loaded," Strome said. "So the mark is bright in a one-cell embryo, less bright after the cell divides, dimmer still in a four-cell embryo, and by about 24 to 48 cells we can't see it anymore."</p>
<p>The researchers then did the converse experiment, fertilizing normal egg cells with mutant sperm. The methylation enzyme (called PRC2) is normally present in egg cells but not in sperm, which don't contribute much more than their chromosomes to the embryo. So the embryos in the new experiment still had six naked chromosomes (this time from the sperm) and six marked chromosomes, but now they also had the enzyme.</p>
<p>"Remarkably, when we watch the chromosomes through cell divisions, the marked chromosomes remain marked and stay bright, because the enzyme keeps restoring the mark, but the naked chromosomes stay naked, division after division," Strome said. "That shows that the pattern of marks that was inherited is being transmitted through multiple cell divisions."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Important implications</strong></p>
<p>Strome noted that the findings in this study of transmission of histone methylation in <i>C. elegans</i> have important implications in other organisms, even though different organisms use the repressive marker that was studied to regulate different genes during different aspects of development. All animals use the same enzyme to create the same methylation mark as a signal for gene repression, and her colleagues who study epigenetics in mice and humans are excited about the new findings, Strome said.</p>
<p>"Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is not a solved field--it's very much in flux," she said. "There are dozens of potential epigenetic markers. In studies that document parent-to-child epigenetic inheritance, it's not clear what's being passed on, and understanding it molecularly is very complicated. We have a specific example of epigenetic memory that is passed on, and we can see it in the microscope. It's one piece of the puzzle."</p>

<p>As a CLIR Digital Humanities Specialist, Deblinger will have the opportunity to build a community around digital humanities scholarship at a time when the practice is emerging at UCSC.</p>
<p>Collaborating with librarians, faculty and students across multiple divisions, Deblinger will explore online collaborative research practices supporting digital humanities and develop a pilot infrastructure to support this research.</p>
<p>She will also examine the role of the University Library supporting digital humanities, conduct workshops, and help to facilitate graduate research.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very exciting opportunity for the campus,&#8221; said Elizabeth Cowell, University Librarian. &#8220;Working with the CLIR fellow and our faculty we can identify the expertise and services the Library can foster in support of emerging digital humanities scholarship needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deblinger, who received her Ph.D in History from UCLA, brings a wealth of experience in digital humanities projects and is the recipient of multiple honors and fellowships.</p>
<p>Collaborating with UCLA faculty Sarah Stein and Todd Presner, she served as technical consultant on the development of a textual database supporting the publication of <em>Sephardic Lives: A Documentary History of the Ottoman Judeo-Spanish World and its Diaspora, 1700-1950</em>; and was the thematic expert at the UCLA Center for Digital Humanities for the computational visualization of Shoah Foundation Holocaust testimonies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so pleased to have a scholar with Deblinger&#8217;s knowledge and expertise engage in a broad discussion of the role of digital technologies in Humanities research methodologies,&#8221; noted Alan Christy, UC Santa Cruz Associate Professor of History.</p>
<p>&#8220;But perhaps most significant is the opportunity this fellowship provides to understand our current capacity, along with the Library, and develop a shared understanding of a desired future for digital humanities scholarship at UCSC.&#8221;</p>
<p>This effort is co-sponsored by the University Library, the Office of the Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor, the Humanities Division, Information Technology Services, the Graduate Division, and the Office of Research.<br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8feee24b807270466b1f05a19fc0160c"><name>sea-otter-population</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>California's sea otter numbers holding steady</title><summary>California's sea otter population is slowly swimming toward recovery, according to the latest field survey.</summary><keywords>Tim Tinker, sea otter population, sea otter recovery, Sea Otter Awareness Week, California sea otters, southern sea otter population</keywords><start-date>1411404900000</start-date><display-name>California's sea otter numbers holding steady</display-name><path>/2014/09/sea-otter-population</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/sea-otter-population</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1411164070422</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1617035656219</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Ben Young Landis, USGS</name><title></title><phone/><email>blandis@usgs.gov</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/otter-tongue-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/otter-tongue-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>otter-tongue-350.jpg</name><display-name>otter-tongue-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>61236</file-size><width>350</width><height>234</height></image><image-alt>sea otter with tongue out</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/otter-tongue-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/otter-tongue-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>otter-tongue-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>otter-tongue-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20535</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>sea otter with tongue out</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Sea Otter Awareness Week is held every year in September to highlight ongoing conservation efforts to ensure that sea otters remain a part of our marine environment.

Likewise, California's sea otter numbers are holding steady despite many forces pushing against their population recovery, according to the latest field survey led by federal, state, and UC Santa Cruz scientists.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, U.S. Geological Survey scientists have calculated a population index each year for the southern sea otter <i>(Enhydra lutris nereis),</i> a species federally listed as threatened. For 2014, USGS reports the population index as 2,944 (<a href="http://www.werc.usgs.gov/seaottercount">data available online</a>). It's a negligible bump from the 2013 report of 2,939.</p>
<p>For southern sea otters to be considered for removal from the threatened species list, the population index would have to exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years, according to the Southern Sea Otter Recovery Plan established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>"For an animal so few in number, sea otter population trends can be influenced by many local and range-wide factors," said Tim Tinker, a biologist with <a href="http://werc.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz and the USGS Western Ecological Research Center</a> who leads California sea otter research with co-investigators from UC Santa Cruz, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Office of Spill Prevention and Response, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and other institutions. "We are seeing elevated mortality suggestive of food resource limitation in some parts of the range, and increasing mortality from white shark attacks in others. But our federal, state, aquarium, and university sea otter research alliance is making progress in understanding how all these trends relate to environmental factors along the California coast."</p>
<p>California sea otters feed and live in the "nearshore marine ecosystem"&#8212;the stretch of ocean along the shoreline&#8212;making them a good indicator species for detecting pollutants and pathogens washed down from coastlands. Along many parts of Pacific North America, sea otters play critical roles in natural food webs, keeping important ecosystems like kelp forests and seagrass beds in balance.</p>
<p>Studying sea otters, then, not only helps us understand their population recovery, but also uncovers clues on the health and rhythm of nearshore marine ecosystems&#8212;the same waters many people swim, fish, and make a living in every day.</p>
<p><strong>Mothers and Pups</strong></p>
<p>Sea otters were presumed extinct in California after the 19th century fur trade years, but were rediscovered in the 1930s by the public, when as few as 50 animals were documented persisting in nearshore areas off the coast of Big Sur. In that context, the present state of California sea otters isn&#8217;t terrible. But population recovery has been slow.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is the extreme, edge-of-the-knife life history of sea otters. Not equipped with blubber like whales and seals, sea otters must rely on their fur coat and their super-high metabolic rate to stay warm. "The average adult sea otter has to actively hunt and eat 20 to 30 percent of its body mass in food each day just to meet its energy requirements," Tinker said.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/06/sea-otter-moms.html">Research led by UC Santa Cruz scientists</a> and published earlier this year measured how this energy demand changes for a nursing mother sea otter, who has to eat not only to keep herself alive but also to produce milk for her pup. Researchers calculated that a mother sea otter has to nearly double her energy intake to keep herself and her pup fed&#8212;she has to find enough groceries and eat for two, so to speak, for six months straight.</p>
<p>Indeed, researchers have documented a high mortality rate among prime-breeding-age female sea otters in California from what they call "end-lactation syndrome"&#8212;when females are so underweight and energetically stressed after raising a pup that they are more vulnerable to life-threatening diseases and infections. The new research offers an explanation for the high mortality in breeding-age females in the center part of the sea otter's California range (Seaside to Cayucos), which is likely at or near "carrying capacity," the maximum population size that can be sustained over the long term by the resources available in the area.</p>
<p>"These fundamentally high energy demands are likely the underlying reason why we see so much mortality among prime-age females in the middle of their geographic range, where the density of the sea otter population is highest and resources are limited," explained UC Santa Cruz biologist Nicole Thometz, who led the study. "In the center of the range, they appear to be up against their physiological limits."</p>
<p>But give even more credit to these sea otter moms: the 2014 population index also reported a record high for pups. "The ratio of dependent pups to adult otters remains high overall, and together with data from tagging studies, that tells us that reproductive rates are within the normal range and not limiting recovery," said USGS biologist Brian Hatfield, who coordinates the annual population survey.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="map of sea otter distribution" height="939" src="images/linear-density-700.jpg" width="700"/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Le Morte d'Otter</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether more pups will translate into overall population growth. Hatfield also coordinates a yearly review of sea otter strandings&#8212;the number of dead, sick or injured sea otters recovered along California's coast each year, including those reported by the public to researchers. In 2013, scientists came across a total of 340 stranded sea otters&#8212;a slight drop from 2012 but still remarkably high. However, Hatfield points out that the stranding number accounts only for sea otters that people find, and past research indicates that possibly fewer than 50 percent of sea otters that die in the wild wash ashore.</p>
<p>For the sea otter carcasses that do get reported, a subset is sent to the state's Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center in Santa Cruz, where scientists conduct necropsies to determine the primary causes of death and to identify other factors that may have contributed to the death of each animal.</p>
<p>These necropsies are how scientists learned about the increase in bite wounds from great white sharks&#8212;apparently the result of "exploratory bites" that do not lead to consumption of the otter by the shark, but that nonetheless often result in the death of the otter. This cause of death has been common at the north end of the range (from Pigeon Point to Seaside) for some time, but in recent years it has become most intense in the southern end of the range (from Cayucos to Gaviota)&#8212;to the point where the adult population there now has a declining trend.</p>
<p>Not great news for the dense patch of otters stuck in the central range, trying to expand northward and southward.</p>
<p>The state lab has revealed many other causes of death as well for sea otters across California. Over the years, California state veterinarians have found sea otters poisoned by the microbial toxin microcystin&#8212;which can flow into the sea after blooming in warm lakes with an overabundance of nutrients&#8212;as well as sea otters infected with protozoan parasites that can cause fatal brain infections, including <i>Toxoplasma gondii,</i> which is transmitted by the feces of wild and domestic cats.</p>
<p>Other known sources of California sea otter mortality include bacterial infections, heart disease, mating trauma from aggressive male sea otters, boat strikes, and gunshots. Even today, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has an unsolved case from 2013 of three sea otters found near Monterey, California, where gunshot was determined to be the cause of death.</p>
<p><strong>Matters of Otter Importance</strong></p>
<p>That's a lot of different factors determining the survival of a creature central to the survival of giant kelp forests&#8212;the underwater jungles teeming with marine life that stretch from California to Alaska.</p>
<p>"Sea otters are considered a keystone species of the kelp ecosystem because they are such voracious predators, and they are uniquely capable of limiting herbivorous invertebrates like sea urchins that, if left unchecked, can decimate kelp beds and the fish habitat they provide," said Tinker, who coauthored a <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/oncampus/currents/98-99/10-19/killer.htm">1998 study</a> that described this epic circle of life in Alaskan waters with his mentor Jim Estes, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The alliance of USGS, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state, aquarium, and university researchers is continuing to study the ecological and environmental indicator roles that sea otters can play, not only in kelp forests of the outer coast, but in protected tidal estuaries as well.</p>
<p>Over at the NOAA Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, alliance researchers have two ongoing studies. <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/08/sea-otters-seagrass.html">One study, also led by UC Santa Cruz researchers</a>, has revealed evidence that sea otters help restore seagrass beds by keeping crab populations in balance, which in turn lets sea slugs thrive and munch on algae that would otherwise smother the seagrasses. Another study is investigating how otters use tidal wetland habitats&#8212;where they may benefit from the rich food sources of estuaries and the ease of resting in warm shallows and sun-bathed marshes&#8212;helping us understand how sea otters might one day recolonize and balance similar habitats found elsewhere in California.</p>
<p>As for the sea otter numbers in California, USGS and alliance researchers are currently analyzing more than a decade of research to tease out the driving factors tempering their population recovery and spread&#8212;a recovery, as new findings continue to show, that should benefit California's nearshore marine ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already knew that sea otters played a vital role in coastal ecosystems, but the exciting discoveries of the last several years suggest that we have really only begun to understand the far-reaching effects of this top predator," said Lilian Carswell, Southern Sea Otter Recovery Coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "If sea otters can recolonize new areas of their historic range, we are almost certain to see an upswing in population growth. That will be good for sea otter recovery, good for the nearshore environment, good for all of us&#8212;because we all benefit from the services that intact ecosystems provide."</p>
<p>The annual population index is calculated using visual surveys conducted along the California coastline by researchers, students, and volunteers from USGS, UC Santa Cruz, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Monterey Bay Aquarium, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Santa Barbara Zoo.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9042baa8807270466b1f05a1ba528c50"><name>linguistics-irish-tongue</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Linguists receive $260,000 grant to study endangered Irish language</title><summary>“Although we all have tongues, we are surprisingly bad at knowing precisely what they're doing or conveying that to others,” says UC Santa Cruz professor of linguistics Jaye Padgett...</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, linguistics news, endangered languages, Irish, Irish language</keywords><start-date>1411413000000</start-date><display-name>Linguists receive $260,000 grant to study Irish </display-name><path>/2014/09/linguistics-irish-tongue</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/linguistics-irish-tongue</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1411169565312</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412189051104</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Linguistics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/padgett_photo_ireland-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/padgett_photo_ireland-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>padgett_photo_ireland-300.jpg</name><display-name>padgett_photo_ireland-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>96556</file-size><width>300</width><height>263</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz professor of linguistics Jaye Padgett.</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/padgett-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/padgett-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>padgett-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>padgett-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25968</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz professor of linguistics Jaye Padgett.</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz Professor of Linguistics Jaye Padgett in Ireland</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/grant-recent-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/grant-recent-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>grant-recent-250.jpg</name><display-name>grant-recent-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>69818</file-size><width>250</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Linguistics Grant McGuire</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>&#8220;Although we all have tongues, we are surprisingly bad at knowing precisely what they're doing or conveying that to others,&#8221; says UC Santa Cruz professor of linguistics Jaye Padgett.<br/><br/>Tongue motion, it turns out, is crucial to the documentation of endangered languages.<br/><br/>Who knew?<br/><br/>And we haven&#8217;t even got to the ultrasound part yet.<br/><br/>Let me explain.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz researchers are working hard to document the Irish language. Even though it is an official language of Ireland and has considerable government support, it is highly endangered. Only 1.5%&#160; to 3% of the population regularly use it in their community, and its future is in doubt.<br/><br/>But one unusual feature of the Irish language is that every consonant comes in two varieties--one where the tongue is raised and pushed forward, and one where it is raised and retracted. So, one important goal of the researchers is to document this contrast--using real-time tongue imaging.<br/><br/>&#8220;We do this using a portable ultrasound machine which allows us to non-invasively capture video of the tongue's surface while it moves during speech,&#8221; says Padgett. &#8220;Analysis of this ultrasound data will also allow us to answer more general questions about speech production.&#8221;<br/><br/>The use of ultrasound in speech research is still in its early stages. Other ways of capturing tongue motion can be dangerous (x-ray video), or more expensive and less portable (MRI). To date, there are very few ultrasound studies of languages outside of English and other dominant languages, and there are none of Irish. <br/><br/><strong>UC Santa Cruz, however, has just been awarded</strong> a $261,255 grant from the National Science Foundation to undertake a new project titled "Collaborative Research: An Ultrasound Investigation of Irish Palatalization.&#8221; <br/><br/>The principal investigators for the project are Padgett and assistant professor Grant McGuire from the UC Santa Cruz Linguistics Department. They will work in collaboration with Ryan Bennett of Yale, a former student of the linguistics program at UC Santa Cruz and M&#225;ire N&#237; Chiosi&#225;n of University College, Dublin. <br/><br/>Padgett and Bennett have both published research on the sound system of Irish. McGuire and Bennett have developed the ultrasound infrastructure at UC Santa Cruz. N&#237; Chios&#225;in's primary research area is Irish language phonology, and she is a native speaker of Irish.<br/><br/>&#8220;The funding from the NSF is crucial as it will allow us to take the machine to Ireland, record native speakers of Irish, and analyze the data we collect with the help of graduate and undergraduate students at UCSC and Yale,&#8221; said Padgett. <br/><br/>&#8220;Analyzing ultrasound data is pretty labor-intensive,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There are three major dialect regions of Irish, isolated from each other, and we are investigating all three.&#8221;<br/><br/>Apart from documentation and research, the researchers also plan to use their ultrasound data to create materials that will be useful to those who want to learn Irish, both within Ireland and around the world. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfpmulMD458"><em><strong>WATCH</strong></em></a> a short video of an Irish tongue moving.<br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/joe-ireland 2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/joe-ireland 2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>joe-ireland 2.jpg</name><display-name>joe-ireland 2.jpg</display-name><file-size>16765</file-size><width>295</width><height>144</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>JAYE PADGETT</title><description>UC Santa Cruz has just been awarded a $261,255 grant from the National Science Foundation to undertake a new project titled "Collaborative Research: An Ultrasound Investigation of Irish Palatalization.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="905162ec807270466b1f05a15976b066"><name>open-minded</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC places with open mindedness </title><summary>The well-known open mindedness of UC Santa Cruz is noted in two recent lists of top colleges.</summary><start-date>1411170420000</start-date><display-name>Open mindedness</display-name><path>/2014/09/open-minded</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/open-minded</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1411170525812</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1411170648087</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The well-known open mindedness of UC Santa Cruz is noted in two recent lists of top colleges.</p>

<p>Now in its sixth year, the graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering (PBSE) is a collaborative graduate program that includes faculty from five departments spanning the Divisions of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Originally, individual departments had their own graduate programs based on traditional disciplines, "but research has evolved to a point where students now employ techniques and logic from multiple disciplines to attack interesting problems in biomedical research," said current PBSE director Seth Rubin, chemistry and biochemistry professor.</p>
<p>"We needed a graduate program that reflects the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of biomedical research at UC Santa Cruz," said Doug Kellogg, Molecular, Cell and Developmental biology professor and PBSE's founding program director.</p>
<p>Before the creation of this program, graduate students would come in to a department and do their thesis work only with a professor within that department.</p>
<p>"If a student wanted to explore and learn multiple disciplines, that was hard," Kellogg said. "We wanted to eliminate compartmentalization to give students the freedom to explore.&#160; That's good for students and good for biomedical research."</p>
<p>In the past half-dozen years, PBSE has helped change the culture of Science Hill as well as the kind of student who is coming to UC Santa Cruz to study biomedical sciences.</p>
<p>"We have a really good, deeper, broader applicant pool,'' Kellogg said. "PBSE attracts students who are broad in their thinking, who think independently, who can make their own programs."</p>
<p>One example of this newer, cross-disciplinary approach is Rachel Doran, a 4th year graduate student, who is investigating the immune responses of people infected with HIV who do not succumb to normal progression of disease to learn how their antibody responses make them resistant to AIDS.</p>
<p>"I am a PBSE student who hopped on over from molecular biology to bioengineering to work in Professor Phil Berman's lab," said Doran, who is using her training in molecular biology to search for new ways to stop HIV.&#160; This kind of cross-disciplinary training prepares students to use whatever technical approaches that need to solve problems.</p>
<p>Another net benefit is the increased communication between students in the various departments. "Groups of students are really talking, and, most importantly, making contacts," Kellogg said. "If you have a problem in research down the line, you can say, 'Oh, I have this friend working in bioinformatics; I'll contact her to learn how to solve my bioinformatics problem.'"</p>
<p>The PBSE program has hosted several events to bring the entire cohort together and encourage interactions across tracks.&#160; A full-day retreat at the start of the academic year is attended by all departments and allows students to present research and get feedback from faculty and their peers. The program is also developing a common core course, focused on interdisciplinary problem solving and critical reading of the scientific literature, which will include all first-year students.&#160;</p>
<p>Communication about science even spills over into the social realm.</p>
<p>"Before, they weren't in the same courses," Kellogg said. "They wouldn't even know each other. Now, I'll walk downtown and see students from different tracks hanging out together."</p>

University Housing will open their doors for occupancy&#160;beginning Wednesday, September 24, and student Move In will continue through Sunday, September 28. Because of Rosh Hashanah, there will be no Move In activity on Thursday, September 25.
<div><br/> This is an exciting period for our students and their families, and an excellent opportunity for us to welcome them to our University and community.&#160;However, residential Move In has impacts on campus parking and traffic and we ask for your patience and flexibility. It is important to note the following&#160;restrictions and alternative parking options:&#160;</div>
<div><b>&#8226; Most of the lots near colleges, and all three remote lots, will be restricted for Move In purposes on different days during Move In. </b>On Wednesday, close-in lots near Porter College will be restricted. On Friday, close-in lots near College Eight, Crown, and Merrill will be restricted. For access during the weekend, please check the maps below for details:<br/> <br/>

We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus for the move-in period; this creates a significant challenge for the campus community, particularly&#160;on Friday. Principal officers and managers are encouraged to consider alternative work sites for staff members at the discretion of the supervisor,&#160;if&#160;operationally feasible. We strongly encourage the use of alternative transportation options to get to campus (such as sharing a ride with a friend or&#160;colleague) to help accommodate the new student traffic.<br/> <br/> If you have questions about these changes to parking and traffic flow, please contact Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) at 459-2190 or&#160;<a href="mailto:taps@ucsc.edu">taps@ucsc.edu</a>.&#160;&#160;Thank you in advance for helping to support a smooth start to the new academic year.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Dave Keller (Director, Housing Services) and Larry Pageler (Director, Transportation and Parking Services)</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9f9d957d807270466b1f05a1107cf53c"><name>symantec-chair</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz establishes Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security</title><summary>Computer scientist Ethan Miller has been appointed to a new endowed chair funded by a gift from Symantec and UC Presidential matching funds</summary><keywords>Ethan Miller, CRSS, SSRC, Symantec, endowed chair, UC Presidential Match for Endowed Chairs</keywords><start-date>1411484400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz establishes Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security</display-name><path>/2014/09/symantec-chair</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/symantec-chair</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1411427177790</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1411667835964</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/ethan-miller-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/ethan-miller-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ethan-miller-300.jpg</name><display-name>ethan-miller-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>66967</file-size><width>300</width><height>389</height></image><image-alt>Ethan Miller</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ethan-miller-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24584</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Ethan Miller</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Ethan Miller directs the UC Santa Cruz Center for Research in Storage Systems.

<p>The endowed chair supports research and teaching in the engineering school's Department of Computer Science, which has strong programs in computer security and data storage systems. Ethan Miller, professor of computer science and director of the <a href="http://www.crss.ucsc.edu/">Center for Research in Storage Systems</a> at UC Santa Cruz, has been appointed as the inaugural holder of the new chair.</p>
<p>Joe Konopelski, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, said Symantec is the first corporation to fund an endowed chair at UC Santa Cruz, and this is the first endowed chair in the UC system to take advantage of the new matching fund program <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/president-napolitano-announces-matching-fund-create-100-new-endowed-chairs-uc">announced in July</a> by UC President Janet Napolitano.</p>
<p>"We are very grateful to Symantec for their support and recognition of our outstanding computer science faculty and programs," Konopelski said. "The Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security will help strengthen and grow our research and education programs in the crucial areas of computer security and data storage."</p>
<p>"UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering is leading academic research spanning both the storage and security industries," said Darren Shou, a senior director of Symantec Research Labs. "Establishing the Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security enables Symantec to further our cutting-edge research efforts and identify new methods for addressing customers' problems in today's complex technology landscape."</p>
<p>The Baskin School of Engineering is home to world-class faculty in data storage systems and other key areas of data science. Symantec's gift is a significant contribution to the <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/priorities/initiatives/data-science/">Data Science Leadership Initiative</a> of the $300-million <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz.</a></p>
Miller's research addresses the growing challenges of storing and managing massive amounts of electronic data. He noted that Symantec has hired a number of graduate students from UCSC's storage systems research program over the years, as well as several undergraduate alumni. "I think their gift in support of our programs shows high regard for our research and the quality of our students. I am honored to be the first to hold the Symantec Presidential Chair in Storage and Security," Miller said.
<p>The funds from the endowed chair will be helpful in many ways, he noted, from recruiting graduate students to pursuing preliminary research projects that could lead to major grant funding. "If I can fund a graduate student to go to a conference or to work for a quarter on an idea that might lead to a major grant proposal, that's a big win," Miller said. "I'll also be able to give more talks at other universities, which increases the department's and school's visibility and helps us attract students who might not otherwise know that UC Santa Cruz is a great place to do computer science research."</p>
<p>The campus's location near Silicon Valley is an advantage in developing effective collaborations with industry, he added. Miller and other faculty in the Baskin School of Engineering have longstanding relationships with industry partners in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p><i>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz supports excellence across the university through increased private investment in the people and ideas shaping the future. It is bringing critical new resources to each academic division, and to signature initiatives in the Student Experience, Genomics and Health, Coastal Sustainability, the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, and Data Science Leadership.</i></p>

<p>At the same time a number of other institutions have suffered sizeable drops.</p>
<p>According to "<a href="http://www.npr.org/series/347129694/science-squeezed">Science Squeezed</a>," a series of reports on biomedical funding by NPR, NIH funding soared between 1998 and 2003, which created a gold-rush mentality in biomedicine. But since 2004, the NIH budget has dropped by more than 20 percent (not including federal stimulus money during 2009 and 2010).</p>
<p>According to the report, UC Santa Cruz has seen NIH funding increase from about $14 million in 2000 to almost $30 million in 2013. The campus is one of 10 universities that have enjoyed increased funding. In contrast, another group of universities, many with previous funding totals in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, have seen sizeable drops.</p>
<p>The reports by NPR science correspondent and UC Santa Cruz alumnus Richard Harris (Crown, '80, biology) include a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/09/09/342196432/by-the-numbers-search-nih-grant-data-by-institution">searchable graphic</a> that lists all NIH funding to institutions over the past 14

just a few of the notable guests coming to UC Santa Cruz for the Fall 2014 Living Writers Series.</p>
<p>The series kicks off on October 9 with <b>Ariel Gore</b>, author of eight books and founder of the Alternative Press Award-winning magazine <a href="http://hipmamazine.com/">Hip Mama</a>. Gore&#8217;s latest book, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18226785-the-end-of-eve">The End of Eve</a>, chronicles the years spent caring for her dying mother. This memoir has been described as &#8220;Terms of Endearment"meets "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Renowned author <b>Tobias Wolff</b> returns for his third visit to UC Santa Cruz on October 30. The author of such acclaimed novels as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11466.This_Boy_s_Life">This Boy&#8217;s Life</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11463.In_Pharaoh_s_Army">In Pharaoh&#8217;s Army</a>, Wolff has also been the editor of <i>Best American Short Stories </i>and<i> The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories</i>. His work appears regularly in such magazines as <i>The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and Harper&#8217;s.</i></p>
<p><b>Karen Joy Fowler</b> has just been<b> </b>shortlisted as one of six finalists for the prestigious 2014 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Booker_Prize" title="Man Booker Prize">Man Booker Prize</a> for her novel <i>We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. </i>She is the author of six novels and three short story collections--including <a href="http://karenjoyfowler.com/books/the-jane-austen-book-club/">The Jane Austen Book Club</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> which spent 13 weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> Bestsellers List. Fowler will read on November 20, along with authors <b>Kelly Link</b> and <b>Kim Stanley Robinson</b>.</p>
<p>Robinson is the author of a dozen books, including the bestselling<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40710-mars-trilogy"> Mars Trilogy</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41126.Antarctica">Antarctica</a>--for which he was sent to the Antarctic by the U.S. National Science Foundation as part of their Antarctic Artists and Writers Program.</p>
<p>Link&#8217;s three collections of short stories, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66659.Stranger_Things_Happen">Stranger Things Happen</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66657.Magic_for_Beginners">Magic for Beginners</a>, and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2939570-pretty-monsters">Pretty Monsters</a>, have won three Nebulas, a Hugo, and a World Fantasy Award. Interesting fact: Link once won a free trip around the world for answering the question &#8220;Why do you want to go around the world?&#8221; Her answer: &#8220;Because you can&#8217;t go through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also coming in the series are <b>Helene Wecker</b>, author of the <i>The Golem and the Jinni,</i> (November 6); and <b>Katie Crouch</b>, whose latest book, <i>Abroad</i>, is based on the Amanda Knox story (December 4).</p>
<p>Not to mention<b> Andrew Lam </b>on October 23, editor and cofounder of&#160;<a href="http://newamericamedia.org/">New America Media</a>. A regular commentator on <i>NPR&#8217;s</i> &#8220;All Things Considered&#8221; for many years, his essays have appeared in such newspapers as the<i> New York Times, Baltimore Sun, </i>and the<i> Chicago Tribune.</i> Joining Lam at that reading will be his editor, <b>Kate Gale</b> of Red Hen Press, who is also editor of the <i>Los Angeles Review</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The theme of the Fall Living Writers series is transformation,&#8221; noted Micah Perks, professor of literature and co-director of the Creative Writing Program at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, &#8220;Andrew Lam is coming with his editor Kate Gale to talk about the transformations that happen when editors and writers work together on a text.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Kim Stanley Robinson, Karen Joy Fowler, and Kelly Link are all writers who write sci-fi fantasy--a genre that transforms reality--but they are also three generations of teacher-students,&#8221; Perks added. &#8220;Robinson was Fowler's teacher, and Fowler was Link's student, so we'll be able to look at the transformative experience that can happen between teacher and student.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Translations are of course another kind of transformation,&#8221; Perks noted. &#8220;We're also bringing poet and performer Patrick Graybill with his translator as part of <em>Eye Music: American Sign Language Poetry and Performance</em>, an ASL festival put on by UCSC Professor of Music Larry Polansky (November 13).&#8221;</p>
<p>All events take place from 4 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. at the Humanities Lecture Hall, adjacent to Cowell College, on the UC Santa Cruz campus. Admission is free, and the public is invited. For more information, email <a href="mailto:cwintern@gmail.com">cwintern@gmail.com</a>.</p>

"Move-in" for students living on campus will continue Friday through Sunday, September 28. <br/><br/>When fall-quarter classes begin Thursday, October 2, &#8220;we expect 4,030 new freshmen on campus, including 3,550 California residents," said Michelle Whittingham, associate vice chancellor of enrollment management. "Also, approximately 1,100 new junior-level transfers will join our community of scholars, with the vast majority (97 percent) coming from California's community colleges.&#8221; UC Santa Cruz is expecting approximately 520 new graduate students for the fall term. <br/><br/>Students, parents, and others can use <em>#ucscmovein</em> to share move-in moments on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.<br/><br/>&#8220;Exceptional interest in attending UC Santa Cruz has been evident all year," Whittingham said, "2,000 more admitted students and their families attended our campus spring events, contributing to a higher than expected number of students deciding that UC Santa Cruz was the perfect fit for their educational plans. Not only did we see more California students wanting to enroll, but interest from other states and other countries continues to increase,&#8221; she said.<br/><br/><strong>More globally diverse</strong></p>
<p>"Santa Cruz has always offered a distinctive world-class education, and our students reflect a global population,&#8221; Whittingham said. Of the new freshman, 232 will come from 33 countries, and 249 from 37 states. <br/><br/>&#8220;As a California public institution, we continue to enroll a student body that reflects the state&#8217;s ethnic and socioeconomic diversity, but we also want our students to be exposed to different cultures and perspectives, and that&#8217;s what out-of-state and international students add,&#8221; she said. <br/><br/>More than one third of the 2014 freshman class (36.2 percent) will be comprised of students from ethnic backgrounds that have been traditionally underrepresented within the UC system &#8211; African-American/Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Hispanic ethnicities. <br/><br/>This fall's freshman class includes 31 percent from Hispanic or Latino backgrounds and 32 percent who are Asian American. Approximately 30 percent identify themselves as white/Caucasian. The number of African American freshman is expected to grow to 198 students from 163 last year &#8211; 4.9 percent of the total class. Unknown or unspecified ethnicity is 1.7 percent.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz is now a Hispanic Serving Institution member of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, with 30 percent of undergraduates identifying as Hispanic or Latino, well above the required 25 percent to qualify. <br/><br/>The campus is also dedicated to students with financial need &#8211; 46 percent of 2013-14 undergraduates received Pell grants, the federal government's need-based program for low-income undergraduates.<br/><br/><strong>Academic interests</strong></p>
<p>The five highest demand majors include:&#160; Psychology, Economics, Biology, Computer Science and Computer Engineering.&#160; Many students choose to join the UC Santa Cruz community because of the distinctive opportunities to take part in undergraduate research and scholarship; six in 10 students participate in research projects before their graduation, a demonstration of the campus&#8217; strong commitment to transformative undergraduate education.<br/><br/>Among the 74 percent of frosh who indicated a major, their distribution is:<br/>&#9679;&#160;&#160; &#160;32 percent Physical &amp; Biological Sciences, including Biology;<br/>&#9679;&#160;&#160; &#160;29 percent Social Sciences, including Psychology and Economics;<br/>&#9679;&#160;&#160; &#160;27 percent Engineering, including Computer Science and Computer Engineering;<br/>&#9679;&#160;&#160; &#160;7 percent Humanities, with the highest demand in Literature;<br/>&#9679;&#160;&#160; &#160;5 percent Arts, with the highest demand major in Film &amp; Digital Media.<br/><br/><strong>Move-in schedule</strong></p>

<p>Numerous services and events are planned to welcome new and returning students and assist in their academic and social transition. Sessions include transfer workshops, college orientation, tours of the library and other campus resources, as well as academic advising.&#160; This year will feature a highly visible focus on the UC Santa Cruz Principles of Community: Diverse, Open, Purposeful, Caring, Just, Disciplined and Celebrative.&#160; Also, each new student is required to study the dangers of alcoholism and substance abuse, and to learn ways to prevent sexual assault and violence within a college community.<br/><br/>New and returning students will be able to take part in the annual Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk Frolic, Monday evening, September 29, and the Fall Festival, Tuesday, September 30, a resource fair highlighting more than 150 student groups, clubs, organizations, and campus offices.&#160; Details on the many activities are available at: <a href="http://orientation.ucsc.edu/fall/index.html">orientation.ucsc.edu/fall/index.html</a><br/><br/><strong>About UC Santa Cruz</strong><br/>UC Santa Cruz is renowned for the outstanding educational experience it provides students.

(Photo by Steve Kurtz)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal and other campus leaders joined officials from Wells Fargo Bank at UCSC's Coastal Science Campus to break ground for the Coastal Biology building on Wednesday, September 24. The Coastal Biology building will house the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) and will support research and teaching on coastal conservation, ecology, habitat restoration, climate change impacts, and policy.</p>
<p>"This is a great occasion for the campus," Blumenthal said. "We've been working for a long time to get this building built, and the partnership with Wells Fargo has been crucial for getting this done."</p>
<p>In addition to the groundbreaking ceremony for Coastal Biology, the event also marked the dedication of the Wells Fargo Coastal Science Research Center. In 1999, UC Santa Cruz purchased approximately 55 acres adjacent to Long Marine Laboratory from Wells Fargo Bank, including the developable area where the new Coastal Biology building will be constructed. This area, which may include additional buildings in the future, has been named the Wells Fargo Coastal Science Research Center.</p>
<p>The other 47 acres of land purchased in 1999 was added to the Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve, which now encompasses 72 acres set aside for preservation of sensitive habitat and environmental research, teaching, and restoration.</p>
<p>"The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology has embraced field-based learning, and our Natural Reserves play an important role in supporting those field courses," said Gage Dayton, administrative director of the UCSC Natural Reserve System.</p>
<p>Pete Raimondi, professor and chair of EEB, said he was excited about reuniting his department in one building after 15 years during which half of their faculty have been located on campus and half at Long Marine Laboratory. He also noted the importance of field courses for students in marine biology and other EEB majors. A recent survey of former students revealed that immersion in field courses was a critical factor associated with greater success of students in graduate school and the job market, Raimondi said.</p>
<p>"Having seen how important field courses are to the success of our students, we need to make sure we have the capacity to offer those courses to all students, and the Coastal Biology building will help make that possible," he said.</p>
<p>Raimondi and the 30 students in his Marine Ecology Field Quarter course are about to spend several weeks at a research station in the Mediterranean Sea. Coincidentally, one of the students in that class is the daughter of Hope Hardison, executive vice president at Wells Fargo and one of the speakers at the groundbreaking event. Hardison is the daughter of Robert Adams, professor emeritus of economics and former dean of social sciences at UC Santa Cruz, who was also present.</p>
<p>"It's a special treat for me to be here today because of my personal ties to this area. It means a lot to me that Wells Fargo has played a role in making this possible," said Hardison, noting that her neighbors when she was growing up in Bonny Doon were Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, and the late Ken Norris, acclaimed marine mammal researcher and a former director of the campus's marine studies program.</p>

Gardening instructors Orin Martin and Sky DeMuro will show you how to select, plant, and use these fall-planted crops to improve your garden and orchard's soil. The workshop takes place at UC Santa Cruz's Alan Chadwick Garden.</p>
<p>Cover crops are crops such as bell beans and oat grass that are grown over the fall and winter, then either worked into the soil in the spring to decompose before spring and summer planting, or harvested for compost piles. Cover crops protect the soil from winter rains, then help the soil hold moisture as they decompose and add nutrients to your garden or orchard.&#160;</p>
<p>Martin and DeMuro will discuss the cover crop species best suited to the Central Coast, along with how much seed you&#8217;ll need for your garden or tree crops, and how best to time cover crop plantings in the fall and &#8220;plough downs&#8221; in the spring.&#160;</p>
<p>Cost of the workshop is $30 general admission (pre-registered) or $40 (at the door); $20 for Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden members (pre-registered) or $30 (at the door);&#160;$15 for UCSC students and limited-income (pre-registered) or $20 (at the door).&#160;</p>

<p>The arms race is between mobile DNA sequences known as "retrotransposons" (a.k.a. "jumping genes") and the genes that have evolved to control them. The UC Santa Cruz researchers have, for the first time, identified genes in humans that make repressor proteins to shut down specific jumping genes. The researchers also traced the rapid evolution of the repressor genes in the primate lineage.</p>
<p>Their findings, published September 28 in <i>Nature</i>, show that over evolutionary time, primate genomes have undergone repeated episodes in which mutations in jumping genes allowed them to escape repression, which drove the evolution of new repressor genes, and so on. Furthermore, their findings suggest that repressor genes that originally evolved to shut down jumping genes have since come to play other regulatory roles in the genome.</p>
<p>"We have basically the same 20,000 protein-coding genes as a frog, yet our genome is much more complicated, with more layers of gene regulation. This study helps explain how that came about," said Sofie Salama, a research associate at the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a> who led the study.</p>
<p><strong>Remnants of ancient viruses</strong></p>
<p>Retrotransposons are thought to be remnants of ancient viruses that infected early animals and inserted their genes into the genome long before humans evolved. Now they can only replicate themselves within the genome. Depending on where a new copy gets inserted into the genome, a jumping event can disrupt normal genes and cause disease. Often the effect is neutral, simply adding to the overall size of the genome. Very rarely the effect might be advantageous, because the added DNA can itself be a source of new regulatory elements that enhance gene expression. But the high probability of deleterious effects means natural selection favors the evolution of mechanisms to prevent jumping events.</p>
<p>Scientists estimate that jumping genes or "transposable elements" account for at least 50 percent of the human genome, and retrotransposons are by far the most common type.</p>
<p>"There have been successive waves of retrotransposon activity in primate evolution, when a transposable element changed to become expressed and replicated itself throughout the genome until something turned it off," Salama said. "We've discovered a major mechanism by which the genome is able to shut down these mobile DNA elements."</p>
<p>The repressors identified in the new study belong to a large family of proteins known as "KRAB zinc finger proteins." These are DNA-binding proteins that repress gene activity, and they constitute the largest family of gene-regulating proteins in mammals. The human genome has over 400 genes for KRAB zinc finger proteins, and about 170 of them have emerged since primates diverged from other mammals.</p>
<p>According to Salama, her team's findings support the idea that expansion of this family of repressor genes occurred in response to waves of retrotransposon activity. Because repression of a jumping gene also affects genes located near it on the chromosome, the researchers suspect that these repressors have been co-opted for other gene-regulatory functions, and that those other functions have persisted and evolved long after the jumping genes the repressors originally turned off have degraded due to the accumulation of random mutations.</p>
<p>"The way this type of repressor works, part of it binds to a specific DNA sequence and part of it binds other proteins to recruit a whole complex of proteins that creates a repressive landscape in the genome. This affects other nearby genes, so now you have a potential new layer of regulation available for further evolution," Salama said.</p>
<p><strong>Many regulatory roles</strong></p>
<p>KRAB zinc finger proteins are the subject of intensive research as scientists try to sort out their many regulatory roles within the genome. The idea that they are involved in repression of jumping genes is not new--previous studies by other researchers have shown that these proteins silence jumping genes in mouse embryonic stem cells. But until now, no one had been able to demonstrate that the same thing occurs in human cells.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz team developed a novel assay to test whether a particular KRAB zinc finger protein could shut down certain jumping genes. The first authors of the paper, postdoctoral researcher Frank Jacobs and graduate student David Greenberg, came up with the strategy of testing primate retrotransposons in non-primate cells by using mouse embryonic stem cells that contain a single human chromosome. In the environment of a mouse cell, jumping genes that were repressed in primate cells became active. Greenberg then developed an assay for testing individual zinc finger proteins for their ability to turn off a primate jumping gene in the mouse cell environment.</p>
<p>"We did all our tests in mouse cells because they lack all of the primate zinc finger proteins, so when you put primate retrotransposons into a mouse cell they're all active," Salama explained.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated that two human proteins called ZNF91 and ZNF93 bind and repress two major classes of retrotransposons (known as SVA and L1PA) that are currently or recently active in primates. Assistant research scientist Benedict Paten directed graduate student Ngan Nguyen in a painstaking analysis of primate genomes, including the reconstruction of ancestral genomes, which showed that ZNF91 underwent structural changes 8 to 12 million years ago that enabled it to repress SVA elements.</p>
<p>Experiments with ZNF 93, which shuts down L1PA retrotransposons, provided a striking illustration of the arms race between jumping genes and repressors. The researchers found that, while it is good at shutting down many L1PA elements, there is one subset of a recently evolved lineage of L1PA that has lost a short section of DNA that includes the ZNF93 binding site. Without the binding site, these jumping genes evade repression by ZNF93. Interestingly, when the researchers put the missing sequence back into one of these genes and put it in a mouse cell without ZNF93, they found that it was better at jumping. So even though the sequence helps with jumping activity, losing it gives the jumping gene an advantage in primates by allowing it to escape repression by ZNF93.</p>
<p>"That's kind of the icing on the cake for aficionados of molecular evolution, because it demonstrates that this is a never-ending race," Salama said. "KRAB zinc finger proteins are a rare class of proteins that is rapidly expanding and evolving in mammalian genomes, which makes sense because the transposable elements are themselves continually evolving to escape repression."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Close collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Corresponding author David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the <a href="http://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>, said the study involved close collaboration between his group's "wet lab," directed by Salama, and the "dry lab" where researchers under Paten's direction used the computational tools of genome bioinformatics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of primate genomes. Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator who has used his background in computer science to do pioneering work in genomics, said he established the wet lab to enable just this kind of collaboration.</p>
<p>"Both parts were integral to this study, and there was a lot of back and forth between them. This paper shows how important it is to integrate computational and experimental approaches to fundamental scientific problems, such as how and why we continuously evolve to be more complex," Haussler said.</p>
<p>In addition to Jacobs, Greenberg, Paten, Nguyen, Salama, and Haussler, the coauthors of the paper include postdoctoral researchers Maximilian Haeussler and Adam Ewing; and sequencing analyst Sol Katzman.

The event is free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The "<a href="http://seedingideass.com/">Seeding Innovation</a>" event highlights the work of a UC Santa Cruz program called <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/get-involved/jobs-internships/ideass/index.html">Impact Designs: Engineering and Sustainability through Student Service (IDEASS)</a>. IDEASS was started by Tamara Ball, project scientist and program director under the supervision of Michael Isaacson, professor of electrical engineering and director of the Center for Sustainable Energy and Power Systems in the Baskin School of Engineering. Environmentally-oriented businesses in Santa Cruz County, including electric Zero Motorcycles and City Blooms microgreens, will also attend the event.</p>
<p>"'Seeding Innovation' is meant to be a forum for the community to come together and talk about how we're going to live sustainably, particularly through green technology," Ball said. "We hope that people who come in the door will be inspired by what the students have been able to accomplish, and they will bring fresh ideas and needs for new projects."</p>
<p>About 30 students enroll in the year-long IDEASS program each year, Ball said. She connects the students to community mentors, often retired professionals or groups in town that have available projects. Working on the projects gives students hands-on experience that may not be available in some internships.</p>
<p>Projects from last year's IDEASS students will be showcased at the "Seeding Innovation" event. These projects include a waste-to-energy demonstration, advanced materials for energy storage, and sensor networks that could be used for smart irrigation systems that deliver water only when the soil is dry.</p>
<p>Videos documenting the projects, produced by high school students training for green careers at Natural Bridges High School/Career Training Center in Santa Cruz, will also be shown at the event. Their collaboration with the IDEASS program is funded by a National Science Foundation grant for Apprenticeships in Sustainability Science and Engineering Design.</p>
<p>Ball said she started IDEASS four years ago when she recognized that groups in Santa Cruz were launching creative innovations for sustainability and that undergraduates at UCSC had skills that could be useful to the projects. Ball wanted to bridge the divide between talent on campus and talent in the community, so the groups could benefit from each other's skills.</p>
<p>Students from any major may apply for the program. Ball said many students are studying engineering or environmental sciences, though she has had students in the program studying physical sciences, like chemistry and physics, or social sciences, like anthropology.</p>
<p>Students in the program get support and mentorship from several sources: their project mentors in the community, instructional staff at the university who help the students operate equipment like a 3D printer or a scanning electron microscope, and their fellow students. The group meets weekly for a seminar that covers professional development and project management skills. The seminar is also time to discuss sustainability in the news or take local field trips to see sustainability projects.</p>
<p>"The idea is to keep expanding the students' minds about the broader contexts in which their projects are occurring," Ball said.</p>
<p>The IDEASS program is affiliated with the Department of Environmental Studies, the Baskin School of Engineering, the Office of Sustainability, and College Eight. This fall, the program is listed as the capstone course for a new minor in sustainability studies offered through College Eight. This is the first minor offered through a college rather than a degree program.</p>
<p>"This reinforces the idea that the program is open to all majors, that all expertise is needed to address these issues," Ball said. She predicts the program will quickly be overenrolled. "The students really want it. They want to learn by doing. They're starving for it."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c23c6399807270466b1f05a19453acc4"><name>unusual-supernova</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Simulations reveal unusual death for ancient stars</title><summary>Study led by UC Santa Cruz postdoc indicates some supernovae would leave no remnant black hole behind</summary><keywords>Ken Chen, supernovas, black holes, astrophysics simulations</keywords><start-date>1411974000000</start-date><display-name>Simulations reveal unusual death for ancient stars</display-name><path>/2014/09/unusual-supernova</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/unusual-supernova</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1412008010577</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412008162063</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Linda Vu</name><title></title><phone/><email>lvu@lbl.gov</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/supernova-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/supernova-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>supernova-400.jpg</name><display-name>supernova-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>102987</file-size><width>400</width><height>345</height></image><image-alt>image from supernova simulation</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/09/images/supernova-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/09/images/supernova-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>supernova-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>supernova-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29036</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image from supernova simulation</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>This image is a slice through the interior of a supermassive star of 55,500 solar masses along the axis of symmetry.

In death, these objects&#8212;among the universe&#8217;s first generation of stars&#8212;would have exploded as supernovae and burned completely, leaving no remnant black hole behind.</p>
<p>Astrophysicists at the UC Santa Cruz and the University of Minnesota came to this conclusion after running a number of supercomputer simulations at the Department of Energy&#8217;s (DOE) <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/">National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)</a> and <a href="https://www.msi.umn.edu/">Minnesota Supercomputing Institute</a>. They relied extensively on CASTRO, a compressible astrophysics code developed at the DOE&#8217;s <a href="http://crd.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&#8217;s (Berkeley Lab&#8217;s) Computational Research Division (CRD).</a> Their findings were recently published in the <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/790/2/162"><i>Astrophysical Journal (ApJ)</i>.</a></p>
<p>First-generation stars are especially interesting because they produced the first heavy elements (chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium). In death, they sent their chemical creations into space, paving the way for subsequent generations of stars, solar systems and galaxies. With a greater understanding of how these first stars died, scientists hope to glean some insights about how the universe as we know it came to be.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that there is a narrow window where supermassive stars could explode completely instead of becoming a supermassive black hole&#8212;no one has ever found this mechanism before,&#8221; said Ke-Jung Chen, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Santa Cruz and lead author of the <i>ApJ</i> paper.</p>
<p><b>Modeling stellar evolution</b></p>
<p>To model the life of a primordial supermassive star, Chen and his colleagues used a one-dimensional stellar evolution code called KEPLER. This code takes into account key processes like&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis">nuclear burning</a> and&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_zone">stellar convection</a>. And relevant for massive stars, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodisintegration">photo-disintegration</a> of elements,&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production">electron-positron pair production</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">special relativistic</a> effects. The team also included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">general relativistic effects</a>, which are important for stars above 1,000 solar masses.</p>
<p>They found that primordial stars between 55,000 to 56,000 solar masses live about 1.69 million years before becoming unstable due to general relativistic effects and then start to collapse. As the star collapses, it begins to rapidly synthesize heavy elements like oxygen, neon, magnesium, and silicon, starting with helium in its core. This process releases more energy than the binding energy of the star, halting the collapse and causing a massive explosion: a supernova.</p>
<p>To model the death mechanisms of these stars, Chen and his colleagues used CASTRO&#8212;a multidimensional compressible astrophysics code developed at Berkeley Lab by scientists Ann Almgren and John Bell. These simulations show that once collapse is reversed, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability">Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities</a> mix heavy elements produced in the star&#8217;s final moments throughout the star itself. The researchers say that this mixing should create a distinct observational signature that could be detected by upcoming near-infrared experiments such as the European Space Agency&#8217;s <a href="http://sci.esa.int/euclid/">Euclid</a> and <a href="http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/">NASA&#8217;s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the intensity of the supernovae, some supermassive stars could, when they explode, enrich their entire host galaxy and even some nearby galaxies with elements ranging from carbon to silicon. In some cases, supernova may even trigger a burst of star formation in its host galaxy, which would make it visually distinct from other young galaxies.</p>
<p>&#8220;My work involves studying the supernovae of very massive stars with new physical processes beyond hydrodynamics, so I&#8217;ve collaborated with Ann Almgren to adapt CASTRO for many different projects over the years,&#8221; said Chen. &#8220;Before I run my simulations, I typically think about the physics I need to solve a particular problem. I then work with Ann to develop some code and incorporate it into CASTRO. It is a very efficient system.&#8221;</p>
<p>To visualize his data, Chen used an open source tool called VisIt, which was architected by Hank Childs, formerly a staff scientist at Berkeley Lab. &#8220;Most of the time I did my own visualizations, but when there were things that I needed to modify or customize I would shoot Hank an email and that was very helpful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chen completed much of this work while he was a graduate student at the University of Minnesota. He completed his Ph.D. in physics in 2013.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c34ae233807270466b1f05a1f82f7c04"><name>move-in</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Move-In 2014, a photographic journey</title><summary>Move-in is always a time of mixed emotions: anticipation, joy, excitement, and even nervousness for students.

<p>Move-in is always a time of mixed emotions: anticipation, joy, excitement, and even nervousness for students. Nostalgia and perhaps an impending empty-nest syndrome for parents. Add the logistical challenge of "where will I put all this stuff?" and you have a potent combination.</p>
<p>It's a time of great promise as college careers are launched and many life-long friendships are kindled. For many, it may be one's first extended time away from home.</p>

This new weekly email will showcase top news about the campus and the media coverage we're receiving, messages from campus leaders, and "news you can use" for faculty, staff, and students. You'll find it in your inbox every Tuesday.<br/><br/>This is an exciting year for UC Santa Cruz. January marks the beginning of our 50th anniversary celebration, with a kickoff <em>#throwbackthursday</em> event on January 15 and special events throughout the year. Check out our interactive <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/timeline/">50th Anniversary Timeline</a> and add your voice to this collective history. (My first post appears in June 1973).<br/><br/>We were just ranked among the top 25 public universities in the country by U.S. News and World Report, and the prospect of turning 50 has gotten me thinking about what makes this university distinctive. A spirit of daring and a willingness to ask tough questions permeates UC Santa Cruz. There's also a desire to contribute to the "common good" that unites us. <br/><br/>And no wonder. We were founded in the 1960s during a decade of sweeping social change. UC Santa Cruz was born with a mandate to be different. <br/><br/>Today, we talk about UC Santa Cruz as "the original authority on questioning authority." That willingness to challenge the intellectual status quo is a hallmark of this campus--and a testament to the courage of our bold thinkers, whose ideas sometimes provoke ridicule from more conventional thinkers and often turn out to be prescient. <br/><br/>Intellectual daring continues to lead to new discovery, greater understanding, and a more just world. Evidence is all around us: Researchers at the UCSC Farm figured out how to grow strawberries organically when the industry said it couldn't be done; social psychologist Craig Haney has bucked the trend to advocate for more humane treatment of prison inmates; and historian Dana Frank is questioning authority at the highest levels of government when she testifies before Congress about the turmoil in Honduras.<br/><br/>Our alumni demonstrate that independent streak, too. Crusading journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Dana Priest (Merrill, '81, politics), exposed the government's secret "black site" prisons and the mistreatment of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Hospital. Recent graduates Bar Smith (College Ten, '12, electrical engineering) and Tom Beckett (Kresge, '13, history with a minor in technology and information management), have invented an affordable desktop 3-D router that promises to revolutionize the "maker movement." <br/><br/>These achievements are built on the foundation of critical thinking that is at the heart of a liberal arts education. A broad education is literally liberating. The ability to read with an open mind, write clearly, communicate effectively, and challenge assumptions are skills that serve our graduates not only in their first jobs but throughout their lifetime. As the pace of change speeds up, we must all commit to being lifelong learners. <br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz is a sanctuary of independent thought, a place to take risks and accomplish great things. Have a great year, and I look forward to seeing you around campus.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c7420173807270466b1f05a1ff042275"><name>photo-contest</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>On-campus photography contest</title><summary>The Chancellor’s Office and University Relations are sponsoring a contest to choose a photograph of UC Santa Cruz for use on Chancellor Blumenthal’s winter holiday card.</summary><start-date>1412060400000</start-date><display-name>On-campus photography contest</display-name><path>/2014/09/photo-contest</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/09/photo-contest</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1412092264416</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412093527953</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Chancellor&#8217;s Office and University Relations are sponsoring a contest to choose a photograph of UC Santa Cruz for Chancellor Blumenthal&#8217;s winter holiday card.

The Ebola virus browser aligns five strains of Ebola with two strains of the related Marburg virus. Within these strains, Kent and other members of the UC Santa Cruz Genome Browser team have aligned 148 individual viral genomes, including 102 from the current West Africa outbreak.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz has established the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ebolaPortal/">UCSC Ebola Genome Portal</a>, with links to the new Ebola genome browser as well as links to all the relevant scientific literature on the virus. <br/><br/>&#8220;Ebola has been one of my biggest fears ever since I learned about it in my first microbiology class in 1997," said Kent, who 14 years ago created the first working draft of the human genome.&#160; "We need a heroic worldwide effort to contain Ebola. Making an informatics resource like the genome browser for Ebola researchers is the least we could do.&#8221;<br/><br/>Scientists around the world can access the open-source browser to compare genetic changes in the virus genome and areas where it remains the same. The browser allows scientists and researchers from drug companies, other universities, and governments to study the virus and its genomic changes as they seek a solution to halt the epidemic. <br/><br/>The release of the new Ebola genome browser comes as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday confirmed the first case of Ebola in the United States. <br/><br/>The Ebola browser was started shortly after a phone conversation between Kent and his sister, an epidemiologist at the CDC, who spoke of how she and her staff were consumed with Ebola research in the face of the escalating crisis. UC Santa Cruz Professor Phil Berman, an HIV specialist, had also asked Kent for help with his efforts in developing a vaccine for Ebola.<br/><br/>Kent asked his supervisor, UC Santa Cruz bioinformatics researcher David Haussler, if he could divert his team to Ebola work.&#160; Haussler replied with an enthusiastic affirmative, and they pulled together a team of UC Santa Cruz bioinformatics scientists that, within a week, was able to create a fully functional Ebola genome browser. <br/><br/>"The incredible speed with which this group was able to assemble all the genetic information about Ebola and make it available to the world shows what a great team Jim Kent has assembled," Haussler said.<br/><br/><a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/archive/99-00/06-00/human_gemone.htm">In June 2000, Kent and Haussler released the first working draft of the human genome</a> sequence on the web. Two months later, Kent developed the UCSC Genome Browser, which has become an essential resource to biomedical science.<br/><br/>In a similar marshaling of forces in the face of a worldwide threat 11 years ago, <a href="https://cbse.soe.ucsc.edu/sites/default/files/genometech0703aa.pdf">UC Santa Cruz researchers created a SARS virus browser.</a> <br/><br/></p>
