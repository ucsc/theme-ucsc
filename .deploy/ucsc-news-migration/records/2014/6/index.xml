When researchers at <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/client-programs/accelerated-discovery-lab/">IBM's Accelerated Discovery Lab</a> in San Jose proposed a software project involving polymer chemistry, Werner assembled a multi-disciplinary team of seven students that has achieved impressive results.</p>
<p>The IBM Polymer Discovery team and other participants in the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>'s <a href="http://csspp.soe.ucsc.edu/">Corporate Sponsored Senior Projects Program</a> presented their work at Partner's Day on Thursday, May 29. This is the third year of the program, which gives engineering students the opportunity to work on real-world challenges proposed by corporate sponsors.</p>
<p>For the students on the IBM team, Partner's Day was just the latest opportunity to present their work. Two days earlier, they had presented a poster on their results at the Academy of Science and Engineering's <a href="http://bigdata2014stanford.scienceengineering.org/">International Conference on Big Data Science and Computing</a> at Stanford University. And in April, they presented a paper at a conference of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) in Connecticut, where they earned an honorable mention.</p>
<p>"It's been exciting," said team member Igor Shvartser, a math major with a minor in computer science. "Learning how to work with a team and with people from other disciplines is a key skill that we can take out of this experience."</p>
<p>The project also earned the team a Baskin School of Engineering Dean's Award. "This is the kind of experience that is possible if the students jump into the project and the company is really involved," Werner said. "When that's the case, we have a perfect situation."</p>
<p>The challenge for the Polymer Discovery team was to develop software for analyzing published information on the structure and properties of polymers. The ultimate goal is to enable the use of big data analytics to speed up the design and discovery of new polymers. But the diagrams of polymer structures in journal papers and patents, while easy for chemists to understand, are not in a format that computer software can read.</p>
<p>"Our task was to create a way to digitize those images so they can be stored in a database that researchers can query to find information about polymers quickly and easily," said team member Konstantin Litovskiy, a computer science major.</p>
<p>An open-source software tool called OSRA (Optical Structure Recognition Application) is able to do this for most chemical structure images. But OSRA doesn't work for polymers, which are represented using special notation to indicate substructures that are repeated multiple times in polymer chains. So the students developed <a href="http://posra.nationbuilder.com/">P-OSRA</a>, which extends the OSRA tool to support polymer diagrams.</p>
<p>"I'm very pleased with the progress they've made," said Julia Rice, a computational chemist and one of four IBM research scientists who worked closely with the student team. "The project was challenging because it required not only computer science but also an understanding of chemistry, and they had to figure out how to do it within the context of the existing software code."</p>
<p>When Werner was assembling the team in the fall, she was concerned about having computer science students work on such a chemistry-heavy project. So she went searching outside the Baskin School of Engineering to find a student with a strong background in chemistry. That's how Matthew Reed, a senior majoring in molecular, cell and developmental biology, came to be on the team.</p>
<p>"He was able to guide us through the chemical nomenclature," Litovskiy said. "Chemists and computer scientists communicate in different ways, so that was one of the challenges we had to overcome in order to collaborate as a team."</p>
<p>According to Werner, communicating with other disciplines is now a common challenge for software engineers. "Technology is everywhere now, so we're solving problems for other disciplines, and we need to be able to communicate with people in those disciplines," she said.</p>
<p>Werner said she was impressed by the ability of the students on the team to listen to and learn from each other. "They all had different interests and skills, and they were able to work together effectively," she said. "Aside from technical chops, the number one thing companies want is the ability to work collaboratively with others, and these students got a lot of experience with that."</p>
<p>Engineering dean Art Ramirez said the corporate sponsorships are especially valuable for students because they present real-world challenges. "The students who have participated in this program have been provided with a unique opportunity to experience working on real-world projects that involve design, budgets, deadlines, teamwork, and reviews with their team mentor," he said. "They have come away with a sense of professionalism and pride in their work, and we also take great pride in what the students have accomplished."</p>
<p>The Polymer Discovery team consisted of Thomas Goddard, Konstantin Litovskiy, Nathan Nichols-Roy, Matthew Reed, Igor Shvartser, Nicholas Smith, and David Zeppa. Their mentors at IBM's Almaden Research Center were Julia Rice, Hans Horn, Amanda Engler, and Jed Pitera.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Tsien Architects, </b>has been selected to design the campus&#8217;s new <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Institute of the Arts and Sciences</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>Conceived as more than a museum, the Institute will be the first of its kind at a research university, focusing on both the arts and the sciences and their relationship to other disciplines. Designed to function as an intellectual hub, it will provide space for site-specific installations, exhibits, seminars, residencies by artists and scholars, and hands-on research by students and faculty.</p>
<p>With a national and international scope, the Institute will also curate traveling art exhibitions and create projects linked to the university curriculum, drawing from the rich archives and collections of all of the UC campuses.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;After an international search that included some of the most renowned architects working today, we are thrilled to welcome the firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects as designers of the signature facility for our new Institute of Arts and Sciences,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The site for this Institute is one of unsurpassed beauty,&#8221; noted Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. &#8220;We are inspired by the challenge to create a place that will nourish the spirit of discovery and honor the power of this land. We hope to make a place with a great and shining spirit to nurture a rich and creative dialogue for the arts and sciences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Winner of last year&#8217;s American Institute of Architects &#8220;Firm of the Year&#8221; Award, TWBTA has been practicing architecture in New York for over 25 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their elegant and widely praised design for the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia is only the most recent example of the strong track record of cultural and educational projects they have built,&#8221; noted John Weber, founding director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences. &#8220;Two examples on the West Coast are the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla and the C.V. Starr East Asian Library at UC Berkeley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Known as teachers and mentors as well as designers, Williams and Tsien have taught extensively at architecture schools around the country and are currently on the faculty at Yale University. For UC Santa Cruz's Institute of the Arts and Sciences, TWBTA will collaborate with the San Francisco architects TEF and the landscape architect Cheryl Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Past clients of TWBTA universally praised their design vision, commitment to architectural quality, and ability to both listen and lead in the design process,&#8221; said David Yager, UCSC Dean of the Arts. &#8220;They are known as superb collaborators.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>Sited with stunning views of Monterey Bay, the Institute&#8217;s architectural plan calls for a 30,000-square-foot facility that will include exhibition galleries; seminar rooms and public event spaces; collection storage; studios and offices; a caf&#233;; and ample public gathering areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no other university in the world that attempts to coexist with a natural landscape of UCSC&#8217;s complexity and beauty,&#8221; noted UCSC Campus Architect John Barnes. &#8220;And there is no other academic program trying to do what the Institute will do. We were looking for architects with the intelligence to challenge our preconceptions, the flexibility to respond to our requirements, and the creativity to ignite the imagination of those who will use and visit the Institute,&#8221; said Barnes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first task for the architects at UCSC will be to review and revise their initial concept for the facility, after which they will produce a fundraising package of renderings and concept plans.</p>
<p>Weber said that the University anticipates moving quickly into the next programming phases in the summer and fall, working with a campus-wide committee to establish the Institute&#8217;s final design.&#160; &#8220;The precise construction calendar for the new facility will depend on the pace of fundraising,&#8221; Weber noted.</p>
<p>Construction cost of the new building is currently estimated between $32 million and $40 million in 2014 dollars. Total project costs, including design and engineering fees, environmental reviews, utilities, and other associated costs have been set at $55 million.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ias.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Institute of the Arts and Sciences</strong></em></a> is one of the priority initiatives of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s comprehensive fundraising campaign announced in the fall of 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;utm_campaign=original"><em><strong>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</strong></em></a> supports excellence across the university through increased private investment in the people and ideas shaping the future. It is bringing critical new resources to each academic division, and to signature initiatives in the Student Experience, Genomics and Health, Coastal Sustainability, the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, and Data Science Leadership.</p>

(Credit: Guillem Anglada-Escude, Queen Mary University of London)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An international team of scientists, including two UC Santa Cruz astronomers, has reported two planets orbiting a nearby and very old star known as Kapteyn's star. One of these newly-discovered planets orbits within the star's "habitable zone," at the right distance to allow liquid water on its surface. The findings have been accepted for publication in the <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</i></p>
<p>Named after Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn, who discovered it at the end of the 19th century, Kapteyn's star is the second fastest-moving star in the sky and belongs to the galactic halo, which is an extended cloud of stars orbiting our galaxy in very elliptical orbits. A red dwarf with one-third the mass of the sun, Kapteyn's star can be seen in the southern constellation of Pictor with an amateur telescope.</p>
<p>The astronomers--including UCSC's Steven Vogt and Eugenio Rivera--used new data from the HARPS spectrometer at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla observatory, the Planet Finding Spectrometer at the Magellan/Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, and the HIRES spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to measure tiny periodic changes in the motion of the star caused by the gravitational tug of the orbiting planets. Using the Doppler effect, which shifts the star's light spectrum depending on its velocity, the scientists can work out some properties of these planets, such as their masses and orbital periods.</p>
<p>Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, and Paul Butler, his longtime collaborator at the Carnegie Institution for Science, have been obtaining precision radial velocity data of Kapteyn's star for over a decade at the Keck Observatory. "The discovery of planets around this star is the hard-won fruit of many years of patient, careful acquisition of high-precision data from the HIRES instrument at Keck," Vogt said.</p>
<p>The team was led by Guillem Anglada-Escude of the Queen Mary University of London. "We were surprised to find planets orbiting Kapteyn's star," Anglada-Escude said. "Previous data showed some moderate excess of variability, so we were looking for very short period planets when the new signals showed up loud and clear."</p>
<p>Based on the data collected, the planet called Kapteyn b might support water as its mass is at least five times that of Earth's and orbits its star every 48 days. The second planet, Kapteyn c, is a massive super-Earth; its year lasts 121 days, and astronomers think it is too cold to support liquid water. For now, only a few properties of the planets are known: approximate masses, orbital periods, and distances to the star. By measuring their atmospheres with future instruments now under construction, scientist may be able to detect the presence of water on some planets.</p>
<p>Kapteyn's Star is the 25th nearest star to the sun and is only 13 light years away from Earth. What makes this discovery special, however, is the peculiar story of the star. Kapteyn's Star was born in a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and absorbed by the early Milky Way. This galactic disruption event put the star in its current fast orbit in the Milky Way's halo. The likely remnant core of its original dwarf galaxy is Omega Centauri, an enigmatic globular cluster 16,000 light years from Earth, which contains hundreds of thousands of similarly old suns. This sets the most likely age of the planets at 11.5 billion years, which is 2.5 times older than Earth and "only" 2 billion years younger than the universe itself (which is approximately 13.7 billion years old).</p>
<p>"It does make you wonder what kind of life could have evolved on those planets over such a long time," Anglada-Escude said.</p>
<p>The international team includes 24 scientists at nine institutions in six countries. Vogt's work was supported by the National Science Foundation.</p>

Read's review of <em>The People's Republic of Amnesia</em> by NPR correspondent Louisa Lim and <em>Tiananmen Exiles</em> by Rowena Xiaoqing He of Harvard was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-peoples-republic-of-amnesia-by-louisa-lim-tiananmen-exiles-by-rowena-xiaoqing-he-1401486452">published in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> </a>Saturday (May 31).<br/><br/>In June 1989, Read had just graduated from high school. Today, he teaches "Politics of China" to 44 UCSC students who weren't yet born when Chinese tanks and soldiers crushed the demonstrations.&#160; Yet, Read said, his students are fascinated with the events.&#160; "From a teaching perspective, it's a topic that really grabs the students' interests."<br/><br/>That fascination may be typical in the West but it is not the case in China.&#160; "The Chinese authorities have been remarkably successful in blotting out the public memory of the events, in propagating misinformation about the movement and in supplanting the protesters' regime-challenging, pro-democracy nationalism with a populist, regime-supporting, xenophobic nationalism," Read writes. <br/><br/>Large numbers of Chinese are "wholly ignorant or only dimly aware of what happened in 1989," he said. Read noted that only in Hong Kong are commemorations held marking the Tiananmen massacre. <br/><br/>Some young people told author He that "the massacre was just a story that was 'made up' by the Americans" or if anything took place it was just a 'CIA conspiracy.'"<br/><br/>In her book, Lim calls this "the great forgetting,"<br/><br/>Read said that Chinese students coming to study in the United States often know little about the events from 25 years ago. <br/><br/>"No one could have predicted then where China is today," said Read, whose research focuses on local politics in China and Taiwan. "I look at the ways people interact with agencies of the state at a very fine-grained level." He is the author of <em>Roots of the State: Neighborhood Organization and Social Networks in Beijing and Taipei </em>(Stanford University Press, 2012).<br/><br/>Twenty-five years ago, students were "very limited in terms of material possessions, though ambitious in aspirations for a more prosperous life," Read said. "There was an incredible curiosity about ideas of the western democracy and freedom."<br/><br/>Now, people are more skeptical solutions will come from outside. "China is a confident nation that no longer necessarily looks outside its borders for answers," he said. "China has become a flourishing power with the Communist Party firmly re-established in its authority."<br/><br/>The Party says: "We are the solution to the problems," Read said. "The government hs done its best to delegitimize ideas from the outside world. Still," he said, "debates over how the country should be run, and what ideas and values should prevail, are very much alive today."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-peoples-republic-of-amnesia-by-louisa-lim-tiananmen-exiles-by-rowena-xiaoqing-he-1401486452</url><title>Ben Read's 'Wall Street Journal' review (subscription required)</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="682be1e6807270461ae4b3b86b7dc93c"><name>sio-search</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Senior International Officer Search</title><summary>The search committee for the Senior International Officer (SIO) will be inviting finalists for campus interviews after the initial review date of June 6.</summary><start-date>1401865200000</start-date><display-name>Senior International Officer Search</display-name><path>/2014/06/sio-search</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/sio-search</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1401907044797</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401907066724</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The search committee for the <span>Senior International Officer (SIO) will be inviting finalists for campus interviews after the initial review date of June 6</span>.&#160; Please see the <a href="http://www.ue.ucsc.edu/SIO" target="_blank">divisional website for the job duties, recruitment flyer and draft agenda. </a><br/> </span></div>

A closer look reveals a technical resum&#233; that is unusually eye-catching and well designed, while the design one is unusually detailed technically. This dual resum&#233; shows Yousefi's extraordinary talents in multiple fields: science, technology, and art.</p>
<p>"I do both technical and creative work together&#8212;I consider them both the same thing," Yousefi said. "An engineer also has to be a designer because engineering requires creativity. Whether you're designing something or engineering something, you're coming up with something new."</p>
<p>The Huffman Prize is awarded annually to a Baskin School of Engineering graduating senior whose academic career at UCSC exhibits extraordinary creativity, depth of inquiry, and overall excellence. The prize honors the memory and the legacy of its namesake, David A. Huffman, professor emeritus of computer science.</p>
<p>In addition to winning the Huffman Prize, Yousefi, who graduates in June with a B.S. in bioengineering and a minor in bioinformatics, will also receive the Baskin School of Engineering Dean's Award, and he was one of 15 students chosen to receive a Chancellor's Award.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory research</strong></p>
<p>Yousefi was recommended for the Huffman Prize by assistant professor of biomolecular engineering Rebecca DuBois, in whose lab Yousefi has been working for the past year. DuBois is a structural biologist studying viral proteins. Her work is used to design novel vaccines and to develop nanoscale drug delivery vehicles and antiviral therapeutics.</p>
<p>"Payam impressed me from the moment he first contacted me," said DuBois. When she gave a lecture as part of the hiring process for her faculty position, Yousefi was there, showing an interest and asking intelligent questions. Later, when DuBois was hired, Yousefi sent her an e-mail praising her research and asking if she might have space for him in her lab.</p>
<p>"I think that taking that initiative is an important part of being a leader&#8212;I was happy to see that Payam would show that initiative as an undergraduate," said DuBois. "Payam is also an excellent critical thinker who understands the big picture and also understands the small steps that it takes to get there. He has had a challenging project, and he's been persistent and has used his own ideas to push it forward. He is a very independent worker."</p>
<p>DuBois said that from what she has read, David Huffman, the professor whom the award is named after, was a creative researcher, and that Yousefi displays a similarly creative approach. "For example, when we hit a major roadblock in our research, Yousefi went home and researched the problem online, did some bioinformatics analyses, and came up with a solution that I wouldn't have thought of myself," said DuBois.</p>
<p>In DuBois' lab, Yousefi researches the human astrovirus, a small virus that causes gastroenteritis. While it generally does not affect healthy adults, it can sometimes have a devastating effect on young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.</p>
<p>"My project is to understand the virus better on a molecular level," said Yousefi. Specifically, Yousefi has been studying the outer coat of the virus called the capsid protein, which has two major parts: the core that surrounds the viral genome and the star-shaped spikes that give the astrovirus its name. The ultimate goal is to understand the molecular process of how 180 capsid proteins assemble to form one virus particle. Yousefi uses x-ray crystallography, in which an x-ray beam is focused on the protein's crystals and the resulting diffraction data allow scientists to create a three-dimensional map of the protein's molecular structure.</p>
<p>Ironically, although the virus is potentially destructive, DuBois' lab is studying it for its therapeutic potential. Astrovirus has the unusual ability to survive the entire intestinal tract, and DuBois wants to understand how it does that.</p>
<p>"The protein I'm studying could have new properties that we don't know about. It could also be a nanoparticle that we can use for targeted therapy," said Yousefi.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Working independently</strong></p>
<p>As the year progressed, Yousefi began to work in the lab more independently, relying on his experience and the notes he made in his lab books. His lab work will form the basis for his senior thesis, "Crystal Structure of the Human Astrovirus Capsid Core," which he is finishing up now.</p>
<p>"I couldn't have asked for a better lab experience," Yousefi said, adding that he often spends about 20 hours a week in DuBois' lab, which has become a second home to him on campus and where he goes between classes. "I wanted to do hands-on research and participate in making discoveries, and Dr. DuBois allowed me to do that. It's been incredible."</p>
<p>He particularly appreciates his lab co-workers, whom he describes as being very helpful, positive, and fun to work with.</p>
<p>In addition to his coursework, his work in DuBois' lab, and his senior thesis, Yousefi worked two on-campus jobs, doing web work and design for Undergraduate Admissions and for the Dean of Students, and he spent a quarter in Japan on the UC Education Abroad Program, studying Japanese language and culture at International Christian University.</p>
<p>Yousefi's design work can be seen in a series of <a href="http://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-resources/CHP-connect.html">full-page advertisements</a> that the Dean of Students placed in <i>City on a Hill Press</i>, and in Admissions' <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/counselors/eslug/index.html">eSlug</a> electronic newsletter for guidance counselors. He has also been generous with his time in communicating with prospective UCSC students through Admissions social media and through the Admissions <a href="http://admissions.sa.ucsc.edu/studentprofile/">Student Profile</a> web page.</p>
<p>"I like looking back and knowing that I've contributed something, whether it is designing an advertisement or conducting lab research," said Yousefi of his busy schedule. "I like the feeling of giving back, creating something. I have all these responsibilities, but I'm happy to have them."</p>
<p>"Payam just seems to be one of those people who are good at everything," said DuBois. "He's savvy with computer software, programming, and design, he's an excellent communicator, and he also has what we call 'good lab hands' and excels at lab research."</p>
<p>After graduation, Yousefi plans to work in a biotechnology company. Eventually, he would like to apply to graduate school and pursue a Ph.D., continuing similar research to what he has done at UCSC, in addition to researching other topics. Yousefi said he is grateful for the education he has received at UC Santa Cruz and the people he has met here, including fellow students in Porter College.</p>
<p>"UCSC has allowed me to not be afraid to express the different sides of myself, and a lot of that has to do with my choice of college," Yousefi said. "Being in Porter was exciting because I met so many different people. Psychology, art, history of art and visual culture&#8212;I've learned so much from my friends. I never go around saying I'm just a bioengineer. I want to be more than that."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6cc6766c807270461ae4b3b8ff8fc201"><name>griggs-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New book features stunning photos of California coast from the air</title><summary>California Coast from the Air, the latest book by coastal geologist Gary Griggs, features aerial photographs of the state's coastline.</summary><keywords>Gary Griggs, California Coast, coastal geology</keywords><start-date>1401951600000</start-date><display-name>New book features stunning photos of California coast from the air</display-name><path>/2014/06/griggs-book</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/griggs-book</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1401984284211</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1401984639284</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Publications</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/griggs-cover-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/griggs-cover-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>griggs-cover-375.jpg</name><display-name>griggs-cover-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>747653</file-size><width>375</width><height>363</height></image><image-alt>book cover</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/griggs-cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/griggs-cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>griggs-cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>griggs-cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>601871</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>book cover photo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Gary Griggs, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has written many books about the California coast. The latest is <i>California Coast from the Air</i>, a collection of stunning aerial photographs of the state's coastline with captions by Griggs and architect Deepika Shrestha Ross.</p>
<p>Most of the photographs are by local residents Kenneth and Gabrielle Adelman, who have taken thousands of high-resolution digital photographs of the entire California coastline and posted them online through the California Coastal Records Project (<a href="http://www.californiacoastline.org">www.californiacoastline.org</a>). Griggs, an expert on coastal geology, has been collaborating with the Adelmans since he first learned about their project.</p>
<p>The new book features 150 of the best photographs from the Adelman's collection of more than 80,000 images, as well as some from several other aerial photographers. "We decided to pull together some of the best of these photographs, write a brief description or some history about each of the locations selected, and put these together in a book," Griggs said.</p>
<p>The photos provide a view of the coast that few people have an opportunity to see. As Griggs and Ross wrote in the book's preface, "Our normal view&#8212;standing on a beach or driving along the Pacific Coast Highway&#8212;is decidedly limited, giving us only a tantalizing glimpse of this fascinating and often fragile edge of ours. From the air, you see distinct, complete landforms, as well as the shifting interface between nature and human development. The bird's eye view gives a more expansive perspective."</p>
<p>Griggs said the photos are artistic as well as scientifically valuable as a record of the changing coastal landscape. After the Adelmans first photographed the coast in 2002, Griggs worked with them to add a collection of nearly 14,000 color slides taken of the coast by a state agency in 1972 and 1979. The Adelmans have since flown the California coast another seven times in their helicopter, taking new photographs of the coastline and adding them to the web site.</p>

<p>Administered by the Humanities Division, the curriculum for the major will draw from the campus&#8217;s Anthropology, Education, Feminist Studies, History, Film and Digital Media, Literature, History of Art and Visual Culture, Latin American and Latino Studies, Psychology, and Sociology Departments.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;The program will build on long traditions of faculty work and student engagement with a critical and inclusive approach to studies of race and ethnicity,&#8221; noted William Ladusaw, UCSC Dean of the Humanities. &#8220;The new major will bring a distinctive transnational, comparative perspective to interdisciplinary work in these areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#160;The CRES major is designed to help students develop a deep understanding of how race and other modalities of power have structured human life, both in the past and the present.</p>
<p>The major in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies will offer students the opportunity to study the dynamic power relations resulting from the cultural and institutional productions of the idea of &#8220;race&#8221; on a local, national, and global scale.</p>
<p>As participants in an interdisciplinary course of study, CRES majors will critically examine methods and concepts from different academic disciplines as a means of better understanding historical and contemporary social phenomena and problems.</p>
<p>In the process, they will learn to recognize both the limits and the value of established educational practices as they develop their own, innovative approaches to studying race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Establishment of the CRES major and a graduate emphasis will provide a focal point for research and teaching in these areas,&#8221; Ladusaw added. &#8220;I congratulate the faculty and students on an effective collaboration that has brought the program into reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to announce the approval of a new 3+3 Program with UC Hastings College of the Law, an accelerated program between the campus and Hastings whereby students complete the B.A. and J.D. degrees in a combined six years rather than the normal seven years. Undergraduates may participate in the program regardless of their declared major, with the bachelor degree awarded after completion of the first year of study at Hastings. Advising on campus is coordinated through the <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/academics/majors/legal-studies.html">Legal Studies Program</a>.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s momentum in <a href="http://registrar.ucsc.edu/catalog/programs-courses/program-statements/cres.html">Critical Race and Ethnic Studies</a> has led to the establishment of an undergraduate B.A. program, with students able to declare in fall 2014. The program pulls from courses in Anthropology, Education, Feminist Studies, Film and Digital Media, History, History of Art and Visual Culture, Latin American and Latino Studies, Literature, Psychology, and Sociology. A designated emphasis for graduate students has been submitted to the Graduate Council.</p>
<p>A new <a href="http://eight.ucsc.edu/academic-programs/Minor%20in%20Sustainability%20Studies.html">minor in Sustainability Studies</a> has been approved. Administered out of College Eight, this interdisciplinary minor takes advantage of the campus&#8217; vast suite of sustainability-related classes and faculty expertise, including the Impact Designs: Engineering and Sustainability through Student&#160;Service (IDEASS) upper-division service-learning program and the Sustainability Engineering and Ecological Design (SEED) faculty group. Students may declare starting fall 2014.</p>
<p>Admissions to the <a href="http://economics.ucsc.edu/academics/graduate-program/ms.html">Applied Economics and Finance M.S. program</a> has been re-opened, and there will be an incoming cohort of over 30 students in fall 2014.</p>
<p>The Language Program has now become the <a href="http://language.ucsc.edu/">Language and Applied Linguistics Department</a>. The faculty continue to support instruction in several languages and pursue scholarly areas of second language acquisition and other areas of applied linguistics.</p>
<p>The campus has disestablished the American Studies Department and discontinued the department&#8217;s academic programs. No faculty were left in the department this year as the faculty had already found productive homes in other departments. Curricula for the American Studies B.A. and designated emphasis had been sustained through a well-designed teach out plan to ensure catalog rights to students declared in these programs. The remaining declared students have now completed the required courses and have access to electives or the capstone seminar course to complete their degrees.</p>
<p>Our faculty engaged in a campus-wide effort to define student-based learning outcomes for all undergraduate and graduate majors.&#160; Program learning outcomes can help students understand the value of the major, the overall expectations of the faculty, and how to measure their own progress toward understanding the key content of the degree.&#160; This effort is also part of preparations for our Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) re-accreditation. Program learning outcomes have been posted on department web sites and student handbooks for easy communication to all students.&#160; Assessment of student learning of these outcomes has started this spring.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Herbert Lee, vice provost for academic

<b>John Dizikes Faculty Teaching Award in Humanities</b> at the Humanities Division&#8217;s 2014 Spring Awards Celebration.</p>
<p>Established in 2002 to honor outstanding teaching by humanities faculty, the award is named in honor of one of UCSC&#8217;s founding faculty members.</p>
<p>The Dizikes teaching award was designed to celebrate the Humanities faculty's commitment to excellence in teaching and its impact on undergraduate students</p>
<p>But the annual Humanities award comes with an unusual provision. In addition to being honored with a check for $3,000, the winner is entitled to select one undergraduate student to receive a $3,000 scholarship.</p>
<p>Godzich chose Carrie Xiao.</p>
<p>&#8220;My intellectual itinerary at UCSC began quite conventionally,&#8221; Xiao noted at the awards ceremony. &#8220;I was strongly urged--and not a little conditioned by my parents--to declare a major in biochemistry, a gateway to desirable, prestigious and well-remunerated professions in medicine and science."</p>
<p>"The conditioning included such things as daily bedtime stories of the lives of famous scientists, along with trips to the local zoo and what seemed an inevitable recounting and recapitulation of Darwin&#8217;s discoveries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My trajectory was limpidly clear,&#8221; she added, &#8220;but it was derailed by a very simple thing that UCSC insisted upon: general education requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xiao soon realized that she was more attracted to the actual lives of the scientists than their discoveries. She also found her classes in history and literature much more stimulating than organic chemistry.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she was taking courses on colonialism, the Holocaust, the history of the novel, and translation theory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found myself particularly drawn to accounts of human inhumanity toward other human beings&#8212;child abuse, domestic violence, torture in all of its forms,&#8221; said Xiao. &#8220;At the same time, I grew increasingly irritated with the way in which these matters were being treated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Different disciplines, from psychology to history, imposed their own particularized jurisdiction over these matters,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Sophisticated distinctions were being drawn, taxonomies elaborated, and the matter was parceled out among intellectual silos that did not communicate with each other. The result was that the voice of the victims was no longer heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xiao resolved to make the voices of the victims heard and their specific experiences acknowledged. She decided to write her senior thesis based on the premise that all these forms of violence were &#8220;part of one whole, the arc of violence and suffering, and that distinctions between domestic, private, public, and state-sponsored forms were ways of masking the horror and giving cover to the perpetrators.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Xiao is one of many students</b> and colleagues who offered high praise for Professor Godzich&#8217;s ability to inspire and engage students over the years, and for creating an inclusive learning environment at UCSC that challenges and encourages all students.</p>
<p>Godzich joined UC Santa Cruz as dean of Humanities in 2000. He came to the campus from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, where he was professor of English and comparative literature, chair of the Emergent Literatures program, and a professor in the university's Graduate Institute of European Studies.</p>
<p>He has also held visiting professorships at the University of Silesia in Poland, the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Harvard University, and the University of Zurich.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an ethical transaction, teaching is performative, which means that I have to be as aware of the students as I am of the subject matter,&#8221; Godzich observed. &#8220;The latter can be prepared beforehand, but the engagement with the students occurs in &#8216;real time&#8217; as we say these days, and it must be carried out in such a way that each and every one of the students feels addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Teaching for me is an act--somewhat acrobatic and therefore risky, and always new, and therefore never routine or boring,&#8221; he added.</p>

He quickly distinguished himself as a proficient &#160;programmer and analyst and was recognized with both individual and team awards from NASA Ames for his work on Air Traffic Management tools. During his tenure with the UARC, he co-authored four papers. He was highly proficient in software development and his work on sector congestion and environmental impact for Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) along with the modeling of Miles-In-Trail (MIT) pass back restrictions was of the highest caliber. His attention to detail was excellent and, as a result, his colleagues had many fewer anxious moments than would have been the case without his participation.<br/><br/>Julien was a very kind fellow, a gentleman, and a friend who will be missed greatly. He was also an avid bike rider. If anyone who knew and cared for Julien would make the effort to hop on a bike, we understand from his family that he would absolutely love it. <span style="color: #1f497d;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12.0pt;">The family held a private memorial service. If you would like to make a donation in Julien&#8217;s memory, his family provided the following information: "Climate change and global warming were the things that Julien was most concerned about and if people cared to donate to Al Gore's Climate Reality Project at&#160;<a href="http://climaterealityproject.org/">http://climaterealityproject.org/</a>&#160;we would all be touched. &#160;Also&#8211;any sort of pancreatic cancer research or support institute would be wonderful, particularly if they are looking into BRCA gene impacts on cancer."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="86d650f6807270461ae4b3b8dbb31bab"><name>never-give-up</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Never give up on a dream</title><summary>Re-entry student Raymundo Reyes, who dropped out of high school to raise seven siblings, is on to his next chapter—a literature degree from UC Santa Cruz.</summary><keywords>Raymundo Reyes, literature, re-entry student</keywords><start-date>1402383600000</start-date><display-name>Never give up on a dream</display-name><path>/2014/06/never-give-up</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/never-give-up</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1402421530825</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1402445070256</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/reyes-raymundo.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/reyes-raymundo.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reyes-raymundo.jpg</name><display-name>reyes-raymundo.jpg</display-name><file-size>107377</file-size><width>300</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt>Raymundo Reyes</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/reyes-raymundo-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/reyes-raymundo-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>reyes-raymundo-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>reyes-raymundo-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27454</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Raymundo Reyes</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Literature and Spanish studies major Raymundo Reyes, who worked 40 different jobs while raising his younger siblings,&#160;hopes to become a writer/public speaker and a college professor.

<p>He was 14 at the time, only three years away from the day he would drop out of high school to raise his seven siblings, and he didn't know a string of 40 different jobs lay ahead.</p>
<p>Over the next two decades, in order to support his siblings, Reyes says he drove a bread truck, dug ditches, and worked the night shift at a gas station in Pico Rivera where a person could get shot for not much more than refusing to sell a six-pack after 2 a.m.</p>
<p>He taught swimming, worked in restaurant kitchens, jackhammered sidewalks, delivered exotic dancers to their jobs, and piloted movie stars to the Academy Awards in a sleek limousine.</p>
<p>Now 44, Reyes has a new job in mind.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz literature and Spanish studies major hopes to become a writer/public speaker and a college professor some day.</p>
<p>"I want to present myself as someone who has confronted life and endured life in many ways and, because of those challenging ways, I have learned great lessons," Reyes says. "The most important one is to never give up on a dream regardless of how difficult it may appear to be."</p>
<p>Reyes's father was Spanish. His mother was African-American and lived in Veracruz, Mexico. His childhood took him to Italy, New York, Mexico, and Spain. By the time he was a teenager, however, he was living in Echo Park in Los Angeles. His parents, he says, had been out of the picture for a long time.</p>
<p>Three weeks before graduation, Reyes says, he dropped out of high school in order to fill the role his parents had abandoned: doing laundry, cooking dinner, driving his siblings to school, and working whatever job he could find.</p>
<p>"It was challenging emotionally to try to appear strong to your siblings when you are breaking apart inside &#8230; knowing your parents aren't there," says Reyes, fighting back tears. "It has, by far, been the most difficult experience of my life, yet the most rewarding one."</p>
<p>His only friends, he says, were Jesus and the writers who inspired him: Voltaire, Thoreau, Sor Juana Ines De La Cruz, Ghandi, and Martin Luther King Jr., among others.</p>
<p>Although it was hard, Reyes says he is proud of the job he did raising his siblings.</p>
<p>"None of them are in jail, even though they grew up in a neighborhood full of gangs," he says. "None of them are addicted to drugs or alcohol. They have good families."</p>
<p>Once his siblings were out of the house, Reyes quit his construction job with the aim of earning a university degree . He was accepted to several UC campuses, including UCLA and Berkeley, but it was UC Santa Cruz that offered the beauty and the welcoming environment he sought.</p>
<p>With credits he had earned at five different community colleges, he arrived at UC Santa Cruz to study literature.</p>
<p>"I think writing is a powerful instrument to set up a life legacy with your own message," says Reyes who is affiliated with Oakes College and will graduate in 2015. "In a way, every person is a book ready to be written or waiting to be read."</p>
<p>Sally Lester, lead coordinator for UC Santa Cruz's STARS program (Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students), says she admires Reyes's "generosity of spirit and desire to learn."</p>
<p>She tells the story of how Reyes, a peer counselor for STARS, once saw a man selling oranges on a sidewalk, bought every last orange, and gave the fruit away.</p>
<p>"Although, as a student, Raymundo lives on a very tight budget, he remembers when his situation was as desperate as the orange-seller and feels it is his responsibility to help others," Lester says.</p>
<p>Besides his studies, Reyes volunteers at the Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports, and works odd jobs on weekends. His other job, he says, is to apply for scholarships. This year alone, he received seven scholarships, including the Rita Pister Scholarship, the UC Santa Cruz Undergraduate Scholarship, and EOP Student Award.</p>
<p>Reyes remembers how a high-powered businessman riding in his limousine once told him that success came from finding a dollar every single day.</p>
<p>"I asked him, 'How do you find a dollar every day?,' and he said, 'I just look for it,'" Reyes says.&#160; "I believe the opportunities are there and I just have to look for them too."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="86ed3118807270461ae4b3b8e9fc9b48"><name>excellence-in-teaching</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Eight faculty members honored with Excellence in Teaching awards</title><summary>One of the highest honors a UC Santa Cruz faculty member can receive is an Excellence in Teaching Award given each spring by the Academic Senate's Committee on Teaching. </summary><keywords>uc, ucsc, uc santa cruz, university of California, social sciences, excellence in teaching, undergraduate education</keywords><start-date>1402423200000</start-date><display-name>Excellence in Teaching 2014</display-name><path>/2014/06/excellence-in-teaching</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/excellence-in-teaching</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1402423029973</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1402937185054</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/excellence-in-teaching-536.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/excellence-in-teaching-536.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>excellence-in-teaching-536.jpg</name><display-name>excellence-in-teaching-536.jpg</display-name><file-size>329516</file-size><width>536</width><height>362</height></image><image-alt>teaching award winners</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/book_apple-80.png</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/book_apple-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>book_apple-80.png</name><display-name>book_apple-80.png</display-name><file-size>12965</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Chancellor Blumenthal and Senate Committee on Teaching chair Charlie McDowell, with the winners of the Excellence in Teaching Award for 2014.

The awards honor instructors who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching.<br/><br/>Winners were selected from nearly 300 nominees submitted by students. This year, eight faculty members from the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences were selected for their inspirational teaching.<br/><br/>"Excellent teaching is a core value at UCSC and central to the student experience," Chancellor George Blumenthal told the winners at a luncheon Monday June 9. "You distinguish us as an outstanding research institution that also values teaching," he said. "At UCSC, it's not either or&#8212;we value both and do both exceedingly well."<br/><br/>The awards include a $500 prize, with the exception of the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical and Biological Sciences, which includes a $750 prize. Nominees were also asked to submit a personal statement on their teaching philosophies. <br/><br/>The winners for 2014 are:<br/><br/><strong>David Anthony</strong><br/><em>Associate professor of history</em> <br/>David Anthony teaches a range of classes from large lecture courses on modern Africa and African-American history, to specialized lecture courses on topics like African cinema. Anthony said he tries to create "safe learning environments that can challenge, inspire, assist, and reward students in realizing that that which they gain through daily effort thereafter forms part of who they become." He uses innovative ways such as Skype interviews to bring students into the real-time presence of historians. One student who nominated him said Anthony "has completely changed my perspective on Africa and history-studying techniques which have together made me into a better person."<br/><br/><strong>Frank B&#228;uerle</strong><br/><em>Lecturer in mathematics</em> <br/>"Teaching is a great learning opportunity," says Frank B&#228;uerle, a mathematics teacher at UC Santa Cruz for 20 years. "There is so much more to learn about how students learn. Paying attention to this and your students is still as important as ever to be able to be an effective teacher." One student declared B&#228;uerle's Math 19 series his favorite class&#8212;even though it's offered at 8 a.m. Much has changed in 20 years, B&#228;uerle said. With a colleague, he is an early adopter of online teaching, a process that has prompted him to rethink his assumptions about how students learn. <br/><br/><strong>Rebecca Braslau</strong><br/><em>Professor in chemistry and biochemistr</em>y <br/>Rebecca Braslau teaches the first quarter of Organic Chemistry (Chemistry 108A), a class that many students must take if they want to pursue any type of biology, chemistry or medical career. It's a task she describes as both a "privilege and heavy responsibility." One student wrote of feeling "positively terrified of organic chemistry" and another "dreaded" it&#8211; until the class started. Students called Braslau the "best organic chemistry teacher in the department" and "best professor at UCSC." "I love organic chemistry," wrote Braslau, who said she uses technology to give students in her large lecture classes tools to be able to access the material more easily.<br/><br/><strong>Kim Cardilla</strong><br/><em>Lecturer in psychology</em> <br/>"I absolutely love teaching and view being a lecturer at UCSC as the best job in the world," Kim Cardilla wrote. She's taught seven courses over the past five years and has found her greatest challenge is to "present information in a way that is meaningful and understandable to <em>all</em> students." Her students respond well. "Kim Cardilla is the most amazing professor I've had here so far," one wrote. Another: "She takes the time to ensure that all of her students have a clear understanding of the material."<br/><br/><strong>Michael Chemers</strong><br/><em>Associate professor of dramatic literature</em><br/>"To me, the connections between scholarly, philosophical research grounded in social consciousness and the act of teaching is as natural as breathing; the first is inhaling, the second exhaling," writes Michael Chemers, whom students call "Doc." Chemers is a prolific educator; in his two years at UCSC he has created more classes than many professors do in a career. He's been nominated for the teaching award both years.&#160; Chemers "expands horizons and encourages excellence," a student wrote. "My responsibility as an educator is primary to my work as a scholar, as much as my research and professional activity," Chemers says. <br/><br/><strong>Alan Christy</strong><br/><em>Associate professor of history</em><br/>Alan Christy uses the research process to teach, a practice based on his experiences as a learner. His students say he "brings history alive." Christy has taken two groups of students to Japan where they learned history by doing hands-on research as historians. He uses "an empowering approach to education based on student-centered learning and collaboration," a nominating student wrote. Another said, "Never in my life did I dream of flying to Japan and using all of my senses to learn past and present history."<br/><br/><strong>Jody Greene</strong><br/><em>Professor of literature</em><br/>Jody Greene sums up her approach to teaching as: "I show up. I arrive ready for pretty much anything I can predict and open to anything I can&#8217;t. I make a plan, but part of that plan has to involve setting the plan aside to meet whatever arises in the classroom on a given day." She's been doing that at UC Santa Cruz for 16 years. " Her lectures changed the way I view the world, literature, and myself as a student of literature," a student wrote. "She is stern, fair, and funny, and is always able to make the material interesting. She is my favorite professor at this university," wrote another.<br/><br/><strong>Martha Zuniga</strong><br/><em>Professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology</em><br/>Martha Zuniga is the recipient of Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences. She uses a holistic approach that engages students in writing, history, and even music as she composes lyrics about scientific concepts. At the final, students can earn extra credit by demonstrating their understanding of an immunological concept through song, dance, games, stories, poems, videos, or art. As one student wrote, "you can see the passion in her eyes. You can hear it in her voice&#8230; it's inspiring." Zuniga "didn't just teach me immunology," wrote another, "she taught me valuable learning tools that I can apply for the rest of life."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="87d12e4f807270461ae4b3b8932fca10"><name>entrepreneurship-showcase</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student entrepreneurs pitch business ideas developed at UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>The Entrepreneurship Showcase in Silicon Valley featured cash prizes, networking, and real-world business challenges for students. </summary><keywords>Center for Entrepreneurship, Entrepreneurship Showcase, Brent Haddad</keywords><start-date>1402383600000</start-date><display-name>Student entrepreneurs pitch business ideas developed at UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2014/06/entrepreneurship-showcase</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/entrepreneurship-showcase</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1402437971152</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1403028974224</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissae Fellet</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/imprint-360.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/imprint-360.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>imprint-360.jpg</name><display-name>imprint-360.jpg</display-name><file-size>52184</file-size><width>360</width><height>216</height></image><image-alt>Imprint team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/tom-beckett-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/tom-beckett-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tom-beckett-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tom-beckett-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23528</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Tom Beckett</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The $4,000 top prize went to the Imprint team of Mark Adams and Brian Vallelunga.

Many of the students developed their ideas during courses sponsored by UCSC's Center for Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The $4,000 top prize went to the Imprint team of Mark Adams and Brian Vallelunga. Their software product can be embedded in a website to monitor the site's performance. If there are problems, the Imprint software asks the user for more information and notifies the site&#8217;s webmaster. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction and avoid lost sales due to webpage issues. The students plan to use the prize money to launch their company.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.makesmithcnc.com/">Makesmith CNC</a> won the $3,000 second place award. Bar Smith, an electrical engineering student graduating in June, and history alumnus Tom Beckett developed a low-cost desktop computer-controlled router for tinkerers and hobbyists. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/makesmithcnc/makesmith-cnc-the-most-affordable-desktop-cnc-rout">Kickstarter campaign</a> to produce the router kits closed on June 9<sup>th</sup> after raising more than $80,000.</p>
<p>TaskMapp, an application that uses Google Maps to display the most efficient route for running errands, won third place ($2,000) and the $1,000 People&#8217;s Choice award based on votes from attendees. Andrew Everett and Jonathan Schalf developed the mobile app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting out in front of people, pitching your work, and making a good impression is hard to do,&#8221; said Brent Haddad, director of the <a href="http://c4e.ucsc.edu/">Center for Entrepreneurship</a> and associate dean for technology management in the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. &#160;&#8220;They&#8217;ve been practicing and working up to that, and we&#8217;re giving them a great venue to build those communication and leadership qualities.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>15 minutes</strong></p>
<p>Sixteen groups competed for a chance to present at showcase, but only a few advanced to public presentations on Saturday. &#8220;It&#8217;s odd: two quarters of work and it all comes down to 15 minutes,&#8221; said John Skardon, a lecturer in technology and information management who managed the student teams for the showcase. &#8220;Welcome to the startup world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skardon, an engineer-turned-entrepreneur, developed a two-course series in entrepreneurship this year for UCSC students with business ideas, regardless of their background or major. His goal was to teach students fundamental concepts that all entrepreneurs should know.</p>
<p>Students entered the first course with an idea they thought could be a good business. Throughout the winter quarter, they learned key concepts in a business model, including customers, suppliers, and distribution channels. Then the students applied those concepts to their ideas. By the end of the quarter, Skardon says, some students had realized their ideas wouldn't work. Others realized they&#8217;d identified the wrong customer or market, giving them an opportunity to strengthen their ideas.</p>
<p>Students continuing in Skardon&#8217;s classes brought their completed business model to the second course, which started in April. Skardon then challenged them to test the claims of each component of their business model. &#8220;Until students have to put themselves on the line, they don&#8217;t learn it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A team of two students, one studying business marketing and the other electrical engineering, recently attended an anime conference in San Francisco to test their idea on a target market of independent artists. The students want to connect graphic artists with small- to medium-sized businesses looking to get art, a logo, or a jingle produced. The students asked 30 to 40 artists at the conference if they would subscribe to such a service, and Skardon said the students think there is a market for their business. Now they&#8217;re developing a pricing plan, which they&#8217;ll have to test by talking to artists and business owners.</p>
<p><strong>Effective teams</strong></p>
<p>Many students work in teams, Skardon said, and he&#8217;s found that the teams are most effective when they link a student studying the creative side of business, like marketing, with an engineer. &#8220;If you bring those two together early on, good things happen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other students develop their business plans independently. An exchange student from Korea wants to create a line of high-quality, Korean-made children&#8217;s clothes to address the high markup on imported clothes. Skardon said the student has figured out that only some aspects of the business, namely design, assembly and marketing, should be based in Korea because denim and fabric can be sourced from other countries. The student has also learned that the fashion industry involves more software than he expected, as machines often have to be changed to produce new designs within weeks or months.</p>
<p>&#8220;All businesses have different contexts,&#8221; Skardon said. &#8220;If you try to apply a formula to any of these things, you&#8217;ll fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eight of the groups who attended the showcase came from Skardon&#8217;s course. Area entrepreneurs coached students on their pre-showcase presentations for the judges. Those not selected to present at the public showcase demonstrated their prototypes or brought brochures explaining their business.</p>
<p>Alumni and local entrepreneurs were invited to attend the event, and many came looking for new ideas and talent, Skardon said. It&#8217;s also a fun event for alumni to network and reconnect with friends, Haddad added.</p>
<p>Skardon said there is a strong movement in Santa Cruz and at UCSC to encourage entrepreneurship in Santa Cruz County. He encourages students eager to pursue their ideas after the courses end to present at local networking events. Skardon started his first company by giving a short talk at a monthly get-together in Portland, Oregon, organized by the local business community.&#160;That event lead to more formal presentations and eventually to the company&#8217;s first round of funding.</p>
<p>The Entrepreneurship Showcase was sponsored by the UCSC Center for Entrepreneurship, the Baskin Alumni Advisory Council, the Technology Management Department, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, and the UCSC Office of Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8803538a807270461ae4b3b8179fcce4"><name>zimmerman-scholarship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Human rights activist named winner of Gabriel  Zimmerman Scholarship</title><summary>Abuoali "Arash" Mohajerinejad is the third winner of the Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship given to a social sciences undergrad committed to a career in public service. </summary><keywords>uc, ucsc, uc santa cruz, university of California, social sciences, gabriel zimmerman, gabe zimmerman, Abuoali "Arash" Mohajerinejad, human rights</keywords><start-date>1402441200000</start-date><display-name>Gabriel Zimmerman Scholarship</display-name><path>/2014/06/zimmerman-scholarship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/zimmerman-scholarship</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1402441257820</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1403035495200</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Sociology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Student Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/mohajerinejad-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/mohajerinejad-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mohajerinejad-300.jpg</name><display-name>mohajerinejad-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>87660</file-size><width>300</width><height>201</height></image><image-alt>Abuoali "Arash" Mohajerinejad</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/mohajerinejad-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/mohajerinejad-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mohajerinejad-80.jpg</name><display-name>mohajerinejad-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>27431</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Abuoali "Arash" Mohajerinejad</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Abuoali "Arash" Mohajerinejad graduated in sociology after winter quarter and plans to attend law school "to be a voice for the voiceless."</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Sociology major wins third award named for UC Santa Cruz alumnus, slain congressional aide</article-subhead><article-text><p>As a young man growing up in Iran, Abuoali "Arash" Mohajerinejad decided to devote his life to engaging with problems of social justice and injustice. He became active in human rights movements, particularly the student protests in 1999, and was later forced to flee. <br/><br/>Mohajerinejad left Iran in 2003 at 21 and went first to Turkey. After traveling through Europe and living in the United Kingdom for six years, he ended up in the Bay Area in 2009 where he attended Laney College in Oakland. Two years later he transferred to UC Santa Cruz as a sociology major affilated with Oakes College. Since then "he has displayed remarkable leadership, a profound sense of social responsibility, and remakable intellectual skills while taking on increasingly challenging projects," according to the letter nominating him for the Gabriel Zimmerman Memorial Scholarship at UC Santa Cruz.<br/><br/>Mohajerinejad is the third winner of the scholarship named for the 2002 UCSC grad (Stevenson, sociology) who was killed in the 2011 shooting that wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. <br/><br/>The scholarship was founded by two UCSC alums and later supported by hundreds of donors. It awards $2,500 to a UCSC undergraduate in the social sciences who is committed to a career in public service.<br/><br/>"I am humbled by the honor to be recognized for this award and I plan to continue being an active community member on a local and global level," Mohajerinejad said. "I am proud to have attended the same university as this great man."<br/><br/>Mohajerinejad said he was trying to decide where to transfer and visited UCSC. "I was amazed by the community that cared for the well-being of others and how close the school was to nature," he said. "This university felt like a second home to me where I could grow and evolve not only as an individual but also as an active member of the community."<br/><br/>As a student he helped form the Global Nuclear Awareness Coalition on campus and also volunteered with Meals on Wheels in Santa Cruz. Twice a week he volunteered at the San Francisco Sheriff's Department working as a prisoner legal advisor making sure inmates receive appropriate services and representation. On weekends he organized fundraisers for the homeless community in Oakland. He is still an active member in the International Alliance of Iranian Students. <br/><br/>All this while maintaining a 3.92 cumulative grade point average, described in the nomination letter as "one of the most distinguished academic records" in the sociology department. <br/><br/>Mohajerinejad graduated after winter quarter. He said wants to "continue being involved with different organizations dedicated to the defense of human rights" and plans to go to law school "to be a voice for the voiceless."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="883fb538807270461ae4b3b8c2b15985"><name>engineering-dean</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Leadership change in Baskin Engineering</title><summary>EVC Alison Galloway announces the appointment of Joe Konopelski as interim dean of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.

<p>A physicist, Art joined the campus in 2009 and has led Baskin Engineering during a period of rapid growth.&#160;He has secured our place as a college of engineering for the 21st century, helping to build our top-ranked undergraduate and graduate programs in computer gaming, supporting our pioneering work in big data and storage systems research, and reaching out to Silicon Valley to build research partnerships with leading companies and expand student internship opportunities. During Art's tenure as dean, the school established a new undergraduate degree in robotics engineering, a new master's degree in games and playable media, and a new Department of Technology Management. Chancellor Blumenthal and I appreciate his leadership and wish him well as he joins the faculty in the Department of Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>The campus is preparing to launch a national search for a permanent dean, chaired by Vice Chancellor for Research Scott Brandt. I'm grateful that Joe has agreed to serve on an interim basis. Joe joined the UCSC faculty in 1984 and has served the campus in myriad capacities, most recently as chair of the Academic Senate. Please join me in welcoming Joe to his new role.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8874cf54807270461ae4b3b831a23b3d"><name>porter-machotka-chair</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Porter College announces inaugural Machotka Chairs in Creative Studies </title><summary>Patty Gallagher, Gary Young, and Shelley Stamp have been chosen as the inaugural recipients of the Pavel Machotka Chair in Creative Studies at Porter College.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, porter college, machotka chairs</keywords><start-date>1402448400000</start-date><display-name> Machotka Chairs in Creative Studies</display-name><path>/2014/06/porter-machotka-chair</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/porter-machotka-chair</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1402448695087</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1402449372864</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Theater Arts</value><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/porter-wave-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/porter-wave-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>porter-wave-250.jpg</name><display-name>porter-wave-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>59273</file-size><width>250</width><height>172</height></image><image-alt>Porter College</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/porter-wave-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/porter-wave-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>porter-wave-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>porter-wave-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22826</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Porter College</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz faculty members <strong>Patty Gallagher</strong> (Theater Arts), <strong>Gary Young</strong> (Literature) and <strong>Shelley Stamp</strong> (Film and Digital Media) have been chosen as the three inaugural recipients of the Pavel Machotka Chair in Creative Studies at Porter College.</p>

The June 10 hearing was titled "A Review of the P5: The U.S. Vision for Particle Physics after Discovery of the Higgs Boson."</p>
<p>Ritz chairs the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (known as "P5"), which advises the national program of particle physics research. The panel published a <a href="http://science.energy.gov/%7E/media/hep/hepap/pdf/May%202014/FINAL_P5_Report_053014.pdf">report</a> in May outlining a strategic plan for U.S. investments in major particle physics projects, including U.S. involvement in international projects.

By the time a sea otter pup is weaned, its mother may be so depleted physiologically that she is unable to survive the stress of a minor wound or infection. Sea otter researchers have a term for it&#8212;"end-lactation syndrome" &#8212;and believe it accounts for high mortality rates among female sea otters in some areas.</p>
<p>To understand why this happens, UC Santa Cruz biologist Nicole Thometz set out to quantify the energy demands of a growing sea otter pup. Her results, published June 11 in the <i>Journal of Experimental Biology,</i> reveal just how much it costs a sea otter mom to raise her pup.</p>
<p><strong>High energy requirements</strong></p>
<p>Even without a pup, adult sea otters have remarkably high energy requirements, eating about a quarter of their body weight in seafood every day. As the smallest marine mammals, living in cold coastal waters with thick fur but no insulating layer of blubber, sea otters need to maintain a high metabolic rate to stay warm. They may spend 20 to 50 percent of the day foraging for food. For an adult female, a pup adds new demands to an energy budget that is already challenging.</p>
<p>Thometz and her colleagues found that the daily energy demands of a female sea otter jump by 17 percent in the first few weeks after the birth of a pup and grow steadily as the pup gets larger. Eventually, the mother's daily energy demands are 96 percent higher, nearly twice what they are when she doesn't have a pup. In other words, she has to find almost twice as much prey every day to keep herself and her pup fed.&#160;</p>
<p>"These fundamentally high energy demands are likely the underlying reason why we see so much mortality among prime age females in the middle of their range, where the density of the sea otter population is highest and resources are limited," said Thometz, who conducted the study as part of her Ph.D. thesis research at UCSC. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the mammalian physiology lab of coauthor Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>The UCSC researchers teamed up with the Monterey Bay Aquarium to study the energetics of growing sea otter pups. The aquarium's <a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/conservation/research/saving-sea-otters#rescue-and-care">sea otter program</a> takes in pups found stranded in the wild and uses otters at the aquarium as surrogate mothers to raise the pups until they can be returned to the wild. Thometz worked with seven sea otter pups, measuring their oxygen consumption to determine metabolic rates at different activity levels throughout their development.</p>
<p><strong>Observations in the wild</strong></p>
<p>The researchers also observed sea otter pups in the wild to see how much time they spent each day resting, grooming, foraging, and so on. Combining these "activity budgets" in the wild with the metabolic rates measured in pups at the aquarium enabled Thometz to calculate average daily energy demands for pups at five developmental stages. The daily energy demands of adult female sea otters without pups were calculated using previous research conducted by Williams and coauthor Michelle Staedler of the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</p>
<p>It takes about six months for a female sea otter to raise a pup until it's weaned and starting to feed itself. During this time, the pup is highly dependent on its mother for food. "The majority of the pup's calories come from its mother, so we tracked the combined energy demands of mom and pup over time. Given that sea otters have such high baseline energy demands, what these females are doing to raise a pup is really extraordinary," Thometz said.</p>
<p>These findings explain why female sea otters are so often found in poor condition--weak and skinny--at the end of the lactation period. It also helps explain why sea otter mothers may abandon a pup before it is fully grown. Thometz explained that female sea otters give birth to a pup every year, regardless of their condition. They decide whether to keep or abandon their pup depending on their physiological condition and environmental factors such as the availability of prey. Abandoning a pup may give them a better chance to successfully rear a pup the following year.</p>
<p>These phenomena--females in poor condition and abandoned pups--are much more common in the center of the sea otter's range along California's central coast than they are at the northern and southern ends of the range. Thometz said there are fewer otters and less competition at the ends of the range, making it easier for a female to find enough food to meet the energy demands of raising a pup. In the center of the range around Monterey and Big Sur, the sea otter population may have reached the "carrying capacity" of the environment, meaning there's just not enough food to support further growth of the population in that area.</p>
<p>"These females have to accomplish a huge energetic task every year. In the center of the range, they appear to be up against their physiological limits," Thometz said.</p>
<p>In addition to Thometz and Williams, the coauthors of the paper include Tim Tinker, a U.S. Geological Survey biologist and adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC; and Michelle Staedler and Karl Mayer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. This research was funded by the USGS Wesern Ecological Research Center, the Office of Naval Research, the Otter Cove Foundation, and the Meyers Oceanographic and Marine Trust.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8cae068d807270461ae4b3b8686a235a"><name>blumenthal-success</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Slug success</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal celebrates student, faculty, and staff achievement as we head into commencement weekend.</summary><keywords>blumenthal, year-end, achievement, faculty, steck, NAS, CRES, ethnic studies, sustainability </keywords><start-date>1402470000000</start-date><display-name>Blumenthal-Success</display-name><path>/2014/06/blumenthal-success</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/blumenthal-success</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1402519553639</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1402522811524</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>It's a good feeling to head into commencement weekend knowing the Class of 2014 has learned from some of the best.

<p>The family has written the below obituary and asked that we share this with the campus community:</p>
<p>Glen Titus Winans,&#160;60, passed away on&#160;June 7, 2014&#160;at&#160;his home&#160;in&#160;Watsonville, CA.&#160;He was born on&#160;August 8, 1953&#160;in&#160;Northridge, CA&#160;to&#160;Malcom Culley Winans&#160;and&#160;Dorothy Winans Miller.</p>
<p>Glen&#160;grew up in&#160;Northridge, CA where he graduated from&#160;Cleveland High School in&#160;1971. After high school&#160;he attended&#160;UCLA where&#160;he received a&#160;B.A. in&#160;Political Science with Honors in 1975. He then attended UC Irvine where he received a M.S. in Administration in 1977.&#160; Following UC Irvine, he attended UCLA where he received a Ph.D. in Administrative and Policy Studies in Higher Education in 1986 (Dissertation Title: &#8220;Economic Determinants of Budget Allocations to Academic Departments: A Case Study&#8221;).&#160; Glen held many senior management positions at public and private institutions during his 37-year career in higher education.&#160;&#160;He&#160;worked for&#160;UC Santa Cruz for the past 10 years as Assistant Dean and Chief of Staff for the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Glen married&#160;Patricia Ladron de Guevara&#160;in&#160;2008&#160;in&#160;Anaehoomalu Bay, HI. They were happily married for&#160;six&#160;years. Glen was passionate about education, mentoring and teaching students, and helping young people pursue their dreams. He was an ardent reader and well versed in a wide range of topics.&#160; He also enjoyed traveling, especially to the Big Island, spending time with family, and rousing a smile in everyone around him.</p>
<p>Glen was preceded in death by&#160;his father Malcom Culley Winans and his brother Bradley Haines Winans.</p>
<p>Glen is survived by his spouse Patricia of Watsonville, CA; his son Russell, daughter in-law Kobi, and grandchild Maxwell of Simi Valley, CA; his son Mitchell of Washington, DC; his brother Kurt and sister in-law Cathy of Sparks, NV; and his mother Dorothy of Lake Tahoe, NV.</p>

<p>Dozens of plain flour tortillas soared through the air like edible Frisbees during UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s commencement activities last weekend.</p>

<p>Taylor Boyce, 25, who received his master's degree in education on Friday, handed out the tortillas to his fellow graduate students, and saved a few to throw himself, &#8220;because they are the most aerodynamic food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides, he said, his graduation cap was too expensive for him to just throw into the air and possibly misplace.</p>
<p>Boyce&#8217;s combination of against-the-grain creativity and clear-eyed pragmatism was not unusual during commencement weekend, hosted by UCSC's 10 colleges, as well as the graduate division and the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="commencement" height="219" src="images/commencement 2 350.jpg" width="350"/></div>
<p>In his commencement remarks at the graduate-level commencement festivities, Valery Rashkov, a research scientist at Pandora Media who received his Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics from UCSC last year, focused on a similar combination of pragmatism and free-wheeling, soulful experimentation.</p>
<p>He spoke of his many false starts and missteps along the way toward finding his dream job. He urged the soon-to-be graduates to take plenty of risks, trying paths &#8220;that may take you to a better or worse place.&#8221;</p>
<div class="callout-right"><img alt="commencement" height="213" src="images/commencement-3-350.jpg" width="350"/></div>
<p>For all his intensive scientific learning, Rashkov, when he first started work at Pandora, was in for a surprise: "I couldn&#8217;t even answer a basic question such as: what song should I play next?&#8221; But he praised UCSC for showing him "how to look for the bigger picture" and helping him find his way through "a messy world with fewer rules. The path you will take may or may not be the path you imagined.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also urged students to remember that their diplomas bore the imprint of all the faculty, friends, and family members who helped them out along the way.&#160;</p>

<p>As the graduate students prepared to walk out into the field to the prerecorded strains of Sir Edward Elgar&#8217;s &#8220;Pomp and Circumstance, March Number 1,&#8221; they looked back on their years of hard work and the communities that supported them.&#160;</p>
<p>Danielle Kohfeldt, 31, who earned her Ph.D. in social psychology, wrote a dissertation about "children as activist artists,&#8217;&#8217; exploring the ways children make public art with social justice themes, and how the process of working together on a mural can turn them into active, collaborative participants.&#160;</p>
<p>Kohfeldt said she learned a great deal about how to be a good teacher, how to do community based research, and how to create an inclusive classroom for the undergraduates who took her course at UCSC. She said that it was uplifting and &#8220;mind blowing&#8221; to work with elementary school-aged kids and get a first hand look at their critical and analytical skills.</p>
<p>Shinchieh Duh, 36, is earning her Ph.D. in psychology, and is bound for San Jose State University, where she will be an assistant professor. After going through the program at UCSC, &#8220;I am able to handle difficult questions. I feel so much more confident now.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 4,300 UCSC students were set to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees for work completed during the 2013-2014 academic year. A total of 3,868 students are candidates for bachelor degrees for work completed in the arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences. Spring candidates for bachelor degrees total 2,495, according to the UC Santa Cruz registrar's office. Another 1,373 completed coursework and applied for their degree in the summer, fall, or winter quarters.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ab255e4e807270461ae4b3b83473078d"><name>desktop-3D-router</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Carving out their niche </title><summary>Alumni business partners find Kickstarter enthusiasm for their creation — a programmable desktop 3-D router with a consumer-friendly a price tag.</summary><keywords>programmable desktop 3-D router, Bar Smith, Tom Beckett</keywords><start-date>1402988400000</start-date><display-name>Carving out their niche </display-name><path>/2014/06/desktop-3D-router</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/desktop-3D-router</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1403030691352</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1403283110367</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/Router students ucsc.350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/Router students ucsc.350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Router students ucsc.350.jpg</name><display-name>Router students ucsc.350.jpg</display-name><file-size>39728</file-size><width>350</width><height>220</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz alumni Bar Smith, right, and Tom Beckett are marketing their affordable desk</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/Router students-thumbnail-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/Router students-thumbnail-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Router students-thumbnail-80.jpg</name><display-name>Router students-thumbnail-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16913</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz alumni Bar Smith, right, and Tom Beckett are marketing their affordable desk</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz alumni Bar Smith, right, and Tom Beckett are marketing their affordable desktop 3-D router after a successful Kickstarter campaign netted them more than $80,000.

</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz student Bar Smith just wanted to solve a problem: How could an electrical engineering major like him turn ideas into prototypes when the equipment he needed to do so was out of financial reach?</p>
<p>Two years later, the shaggy-haired College Ten graduate and his business partner, Tom Beckett (Kresge '13, history, minor technology and information management), not only came up with a solution but now find themselves entrepreneurs. After a successful Kickstarter campaign netted them more than $80,000, the two are marketing a programmable desktop 3-D router that carries a price tag within reach of the masses.</p>
<p>Instead of a machine that costs many hundreds or even thousands of dollars, theirs sells for $200.</p>
<p>&#8220;It lets people compete in a world of really complex things,&#8221; said Beckett.</p>
<p>A tool like Smith and Beckett&#8217;s, dubbed a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) router is the opposite of a 3-D printer. While a 3-D printer is an additive technology &#8212; it builds something from the ground up &#8212; a router is subtractive. It allows a user to carve a shape out of a variety of materials from wood to circuit board to polystyrene foam and even brick.&#160;</p>
<p>Smith, now 23, knew how important a CNC router could be for anyone with an idea for a new product. He had access to a graduate-student lab in the Baskin Engineering building that held a laser cutter and a board router, which cost a total of $150,000. But most undergraduate students didn&#8217;t have the same opportunity because of liability and training issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could spend eight straight hours wiring up something that these machine could have done in minutes,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;That was exactly the problem I was trying to solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began tinkering.&#160;</p>
<p>Smith played with different motors and sensors. He assembled designs out of used pizza boxes. He learned how to program software. After awhile, the sound of drills and small motors began to seep from his room into the rundown apartment he shared with Beckett.&#160;</p>
<p>Months later, when Smith finally emerged with a precise but inexpensive router &#8212; and the software needed to run it &#8212; Beckett, who&#8217;d always wanted to be an entrepreneur, saw the potential. Over a load of wash at a local laundromat, the two formed a partnership. They named their company <a href="http://makesmithcnc.com/">Makesmith</a>, after the burgeoning Maker movement, a technology culture patterned on the Do-It-Yourself ethos.&#160;</p>
<p>With the help of other UCSC grads and students, the two created a website and videos, then launched a Kickstarter campaign. They reached their $10,000 goal in eight hours, and by the time the funding window closed a month later they had 423 backers from 47 countries and $82,207 in pledges.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of like a dream,&#8221; Beckett said.</p>
<p>Beckett and Smith are now gearing up to begin manufacturing and shipping their router kits but, in true UC Santa Cruz style, they&#8217;ve also made their hardware open-source so a customer could either order a Makesmith router kit or download Smith&#8217;s schematics and build their own machine from scratch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith and Beckett&#8217;s router puts making back into the hands of the everyday consumer,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Professor Jennifer Parker, founding director of the campus&#8217;s multi-disciplinary OpenLab Research Center. &#8220;For example, instead of going out and buying a plastic bin to put stuff in, maybe you would cut one out of wood if you had a CNC router, or maybe you&#8217;d be more inspired to make your own gifts for people instead of buying them. It&#8217;s like desk-top publishing only with stuff instead of books.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>The router enables people to fix or build their own products in new and exciting ways, perhaps even to live a more sustainable lifestyle by not adding to consumer waste each time something breaks and needs to be replaced, according to Parker. It also fosters consumer creativity. Ideas of &#8220;what should I buy&#8221; might be more like &#8220;what can I make?&#8221; Parker said. Some people also are more likely to move from design to production of an idea with a tool like this.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s the next generation of home tools that enables someone to move from the digital realm of designing out to the analog and even back to digital when needed,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of fluidity that is happening more and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently, the Makesmith router won second place and a $3,000 check in UCSC&#8217;s Entrepreneurship Showcase.</p>
<p>The pair&#8217;s Kickstarter money will allow them to not only manufacture and refine their router but also move on to other projects.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in an exciting era where things are changing quickly and a lot of things can be improved. There&#8217;s a lot of low-hanging fruit,&#8221; said Smith and grinned. &#8220;All the cool things haven&#8217;t been discovered yet.&#8221;</p>

<div class="callout-right"><img alt="commencement" height="488" src="images/Gliessman_Steve-325.jpg" width="325"/><br/>Stephen Gliessman is the founding director of the agroecology program at UC Santa Cruz.</div>
<p>Long before Wal-Mart began selling organic food, a charismatic Englishman and a group of students transformed a brush-covered hillside across from UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Stevenson College into a lush garden where vegetables and flowers were grown without chemical pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. <br/><br/>Alan Chadwick, a master gardener, introduced an earth-friendly method of gardening that took hold on campus as surely as the roots of the heirloom vegetables, fruits, and flowers he planted. Since those pioneering days in 1967, UCSC has emerged as the &#8220;Harvard of organic farming.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;We are small but mighty&#8212;an incubator for innovation,&#8221; said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the Division of Social Sciences at UCSC. &#8220;Our influence proves you don&#8217;t have to be a big ag school to have major impacts on farming and food distribution.&#8221;<br/><br/>Considered by many the birthplace of organic farming, UCSC has transformed the way food is grown and helped make &#8220;sustainability&#8221; a household word. This year marks the campus&#8217;s 40th year at the forefront of sustainable agriculture. The hillside where it all began is now the Alan Chadwick Garden, an outdoor classroom that&#8212;with the 25-acre certified-organic UCSC Farm near the base of campus&#8212;comprises the key research and instructional facilities for the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).</p>
<p><strong>Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture</strong></p>
<p>Established in 1971 to build on Chadwick&#8217;s legacy of providing hands-on training in organic farming and gardening, the six-month residential Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture regularly attracts students from as far away as Africa and Asia. More than 1,200 people have completed the first-of-its-kind program, and graduates have spread their knowledge and expertise around the globe. <br/><br/>In 1980, the campus established the Agroecology Program to formalize the study of the environment and agricultural systems, building on the apprenticeship&#8217;s hands-on program to create research and undergraduate educational opportunities. The program was headed by environmental studies professor Stephen Gliessman who, two years later, was named to the campus&#8217;s first endowed chair, the Alfred E. Heller Chair in&#160; agroecology.<br/><br/>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, agroecology researchers collaborated with farmers to pioneer the organic production of several key crops widely considered impossible to grow without synthetic inputs: strawberries, apples, artichokes, and cotton.<br/><br/>&#8220;When skeptics said, &#8216;You can&#8217;t grow strawberries without fungicide,&#8217; our researchers teamed up with farmers and said, &#8216;Let&#8217;s figure this out,&#8217;&#8221; recalls CASFS director Patricia Allen. Working with Jim Cochran of Swanton Berry Farm in northern Santa Cruz County, CASFS entomologist Sean Swezey introduced the use of predatory mites, and researchers experimented with compost and crop rotations until they found the right balance.</p>
<p><strong>Organic strawberries</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Their success helped make organic strawberries widely available,&#8221; said Allen. That innovative fieldwork was matched by Allen&#8217;s scholarship, which pushed the agenda of sustainability beyond ecological stewardship to address issues of social justice in the food system, such as the rights of workers to fair wages, decent working conditions, and access to healthful food. UCSC&#8217;s leadership both in the field and in the literature was solidified by Gliessman&#8217;s publication of the first college textbook in agroecology and two books by Allen, including her most recent, Together at the Table, which documented the scope of the alternative food movement and its impacts at the forefront of social change.</p>
<p>Today, CASFS continues to collaborate with growers, and researchers are monitoring the emergence of alternatives that offer new hope to many smaller farmers by cutting out the &#8220;middle man,&#8221; such as farmers&#8217; markets, community-supported agriculture programs (CSAs),and farm-to-institution partner-ships. UCSC faculty are weighing in on the hottest debates ofthe day, from genetically modified crops to fair-trade principles and tension over &#8220;local versusorganic&#8221; production. In 2004,CASFS affiliate Julie Guthman, an assistant professor of com-munity studies, published the first comprehensive study of organic farming in California.</p>
<p><strong>Embraced by students</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;UCSC is continuing to shape the agenda,&#8221; says Allen. Students have embraced sustainability from the earliest days when they worked at Chadwick&#8217;s side. In recent years, students pioneered a farm-to-cafeteria program that provides fresh, campus-grown organic produce to dining halls, and they are leading the effort to bring similar changes to&#160; campuses throughout the UC system. They also worked with administrators to introduce fair-trade organic coffee across campus and have helped UCSC Dining Services minimize its &#8220;environmental footprint&#8221; by reducing food waste, recycling used cooking oil, and contracting with a local food-distribution company. In addition, the UCSC Food Systems Working Group has emerged as a leader of the national movement that is lobbying schools, colleges, and other institutions to buy fresh food from local farmers.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability programs spread</strong></p>
<p>A final compelling measure of UCSC&#8217;s impact is the development of sustainable agriculture programs at major universities across the country. &#8220;Sustainability is at the core of the curriculum now, and even the most established ag schools are building programs,&#8221; says Allen. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty gratifying, because they&#8217;re quick to acknowledge that a lot of what they&#8217;re doing now began at UCSC.&#8221;<br/><br/>And so, 40 years after it all began, UCSC sits at the head of the table where the nation&#8217;s food debate is taking place.<br/><br/>&#160;&#8220;UCSC has been ahead of the curve for 40 years,&#8221; says Allen. &#8220;I expect that&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll be 40 years from now.&#8221; <br/><br/>For more information about the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, visit <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">http://casfs.ucsc.edu</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b6738fd8807270461ae4b3b88f720edb"><name>senior-legacy-2014-feature</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Student philanthropists step up to help fellow Banana Slugs with Senior Legacy Fund</title><summary>This “Slugs helping Slugs’’ philosophy drives members of UC Santa Cruz's Senior Class Council, a student philanthropy group that steps up to give moral support and financial help to fellow students.</summary><start-date>1403218800000</start-date><display-name>senior legacy 2014 feature</display-name><path>/2014/06/senior-legacy-2014-feature</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/senior-legacy-2014-feature</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1403220365234</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1403282277969</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Donors</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/Motiv350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/Motiv350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Motiv350.jpg</name><display-name>Motiv350.jpg</display-name><file-size>47670</file-size><width>350</width><height>219</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/tshirt-logo-80-thumb</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/tshirt-logo-80-thumb</link><site>news</site><name>tshirt-logo-80-thumb</name><display-name>tshirt-logo-80-thumb</display-name><file-size>17037</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>During UC Santa Cruz's Alumni Weekend festivities, the Senior Class Council of 2014&#160;<span>invited young alumni to join them at Motiv in downtown Santa Cruz for an event filled with conversation, appetizers, and student support.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A strong culture of philanthropy exists among UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Banana Slugs, even before they graduate and make their way in the world.<br/> <br/>This "Slugs helping Slugs"&#8217; philosophy drives members of UC Santa Cruz's Senior Class Council, a student philanthropy group that helps fellow students by asking the senior class to contribute to the <a href="https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/5307a8cb14bdf77c7c2680be">Senior Legacy Fund,</a> the only student-initiated, student-funded, and student-distributed pool of money on campus.<br/> <br/>This year the fund provided scholarships for two juniors &#8211; a &#8216;pay it forward&#8217; strategy that inspires donors long into the future while easing the financial stresses of students as they enter senior year.<br/> <br/>Scholarship contenders submitted essays about the importance of "spirit, legacy, unity, and giving." Not coincidentally, the first letters of those four words spell "SLUG," a reference to UCSC&#8217;s banana slug mascot, which turns 25 this year.<br/> <br/>The Senior Class Council encourages students to honor their class by donating $20.14. This year, the Council is well on its way toward raising enough money to distribute $2,500 scholarships to two UCSC juniors next year, if that's how the Class of 2015 chooses to use the fund. The council hopes to raise $10,000 to pass on to the Class of 2015.<br/> <br/>Each student&#8217;s contribution may be modest, but the scholarships make a big difference, said Chelsea Kane, co-chair of the Class of 2014 Council, along with Ada Recinos. &#8220;Our two scholarship recipients are no different from the thousands of other students at UC Santa Cruz who might at times find themselves stressing over finances just as much as they stress over midterms.&#8221;<br/> <br/>One of the recent recipients, Tarren McNally, said the scholarship eased the stresses of senior year.<br/> <br/> &#8220;College is hard enough to afford and tackle under the best circumstance,&#8221; McNally said.&#8220;As the first in my family to graduate high school and go to college, and being solely supported by my disabled father, I have worked very hard to be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>"Despite our best efforts, and even with constant saving, taking on piles of loans, work study, and scholarships as each year went around, I fell short,&#8221; McNally continued. "This scholarship &#8230; not only gave me a financial boost when I needed it most but gave me mental and emotional affirmation. To see that my fellow students who are also tackling so much can still take the time and energy to care and believe in me is more touching than I can ever fully put into words."</p>
<p>Quan Tran, another Senior Legacy Fund recipient, received an important boost from fellow students. &#8220;My parents work very hard to finance my college education, so earning a scholarship eases my mind; I have helped lift some burden from their shoulders,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;Without my fellow students, this scholarship would not exist &#8230; In honor of them, I hope to emulate these qualities throughout my journey as a banana slug and onward."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/project/5307a8cb14bdf77c7c2680be</url><title>Give to the Senior Legacy Fund through crowd fund site</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b68f09e5807270461ae4b3b8f176bfe9"><name>humanities-acls-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz humanities alum named 2014 ACLS Public Fellow</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz humanities alumnus Michael Ursell has been named a 2014 ACLS Public Fellow by the American Council of Learned Societies.   </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, uc santa cruz humanities, humanities news, 2014 acls public fellows</keywords><start-date>1403222400000</start-date><display-name>humanities alum named ACLS Public Fellow</display-name><path>/2014/06/humanities-acls-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/humanities-acls-fellow</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1403222165946</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1403222995121</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/michael-ursell-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/michael-ursell-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>michael-ursell-250.jpg</name><display-name>michael-ursell-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>103816</file-size><width>250</width><height>290</height></image><image-alt>Michael Ursell</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/06/images/ursell-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/06/images/ursell-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ursell-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ursell-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29154</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Michael Ursell</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Michael Ursell</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Career-building two-year fellowship provides $65,000 annually for recent humanities Ph.D.s to gain work experience in their field</article-subhead><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz humanities alumnus Michael Ursell has been named a 2014 ACLS Public Fellow by the <a href="http://www.acls.org/about/"><strong>American Council of Learned Societies</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Ursell is one of 20 new ACLS Public Fellows nationwide who will take up two-year assignments in government agencies and non-profit organizations, including the Center for Public Integrity, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the San Francisco Arts Commission.</p>
<p>Designed to expand the reach of doctoral education in the humanities, the career-building fellowship allows recent humanities Ph.D.s to gain significant experience in a variety of fields, including communications, public policy, arts management, and digital media.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Public Fellows program attracts talented, motivated Ph.D.s who seek to put their advanced education to productive use outside of the academy,&#8221; noted John Paul Christy, director of public programs at ACLS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The diversity of our institutional partnerships, from the American Refugee Committee to Kiva to the Smithsonian, demonstrates just how valuable a humanities Ph.D can be to a wide variety of careers beyond the classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ursell&#8212;who graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2011 with a Ph.D in Literature&#8212;said he will be working as Program Manager for Z&#243;calo Public Square in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>A project of the Center for Social Cohesion at Arizona State University, Z&#243;calo Public Square is a not-for-profit organization that blends live events and humanities journalism. It partners with educational, cultural, and philanthropic institutions, as well as public agencies, to present free public events and conferences in cities across the U.S. and beyond.</p>
<p>It also publishes original daily journalism that is currently syndicated to 150 media outlets nationwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;I'm excited to advocate for the humanities through the ACLS program,&#8221; said Ursell. &#8220;Z&#243;calo Public Square is a vibrant organization with national reach. This position will give me a chance to participate in conversations about big ideas, ranging from poetry to ecology, from California politics to food fads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always thought that advocacy needed to go hand in hand with humanities research,&#8221; Ursell added. &#8220;Throughout my Ph.D studies in Literature, I worked with UC Santa Cruz research centers which were models for this. I am happy that a Ph.D in Literature gave me the right mix of flexibility and experience to make this opportunity possible.</p>
<p>Since completing his graduate work, Ursell has been a Visiting Assistant Professor of Literature at UC Santa Cruz and a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Emory University&#8217;s Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;ACLS launched the Public Fellows program in 2011 with a cohort of eight fellows,&#8221; Christy noted. &#8220;The great demand for the fellowships&#8212;among Ph.D.s and employers alike&#8212;encouraged us to expand this career-building initiative, and now four years in, the program has placed over 60 fellows with 50 partnering institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two-year ACLS Public Fellows program provides an annual stipend of $65,000, plus health insurance.</p>

On-campus attractions, quiet libraries, and hushed gardens, along with a state-of-the-art gym with epic views of the Monterey Bay, beckon visitors through the summer months, while the wooded campus invites exploration.</p>
<p>Here is a sample itinerary, should you choose to accept it, guiding you towards a few hotspots on campus, some of them close to campus, and, in one case, not so close to campus.</p>
<p><b>Magical mystery tour</b></p>
<p>Feel like driving up here and exploring the place on your own? Go ahead and do so.&#160; (see below for information on visitor parking.) But if you just so happen to have an Android or iPhone, consider downloading the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/mobile/mobile_apps.html">app</a> that will help you find your way. And if you&#8217;d like an insider perspective, the Office of Admissions offers campus tours year-round on weekdays. Reservations are required, and tours fill early. The approximately two-hour tour program starts at the Office of Admissions, located at the Cook House, near the campus's main entrance at Bay and High streets. The easiest way to schedule a tour is <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/">online</a>. For additional information, call (831) 459-4118.</p>
<p><b>Paintings and veggies</b></p>
<p>Once you arrive on campus, why not start your visit off with something artistic and organic? Stop by the Barn Theater near the base of campus and take a look at the remarkable barn signs of <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/review-jim-urban.html">Jim Urban</a>, who has painted meticulously rendered pictures and logos on the side of the barn. From a distance you will swear you are looking at a billboard, but there is nothing in the way digital or photographic trickery here. Urban paints his striking images the hard way: by standing on ladders, using industrial Kelly-Moore paints to make vivid artwork.</p>
<p>After admiring the barn art, and if your visit happens to fall on a Tuesday or Friday between noon and 6 p.m., stop by the locally famous <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/market-cart.html"><b>UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Gardens Market Cart</b></a><b> </b>in the parking lot for a great selection of organically grown items, which may include strawberries, blueberries, avocados, salad mix, rainbow chard, and red kale, along with cucumbers, scallions, arugula, Asian greens, Chinese sprouting broccoli, purple mustard, and Meyer lemons. Spring flower bouquets and lavender bunches are also available.</p>
<p><b>&#160;</b><b>A place to learn in the redwoods</b></p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve had your fill of veggies, head up the hill to the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/">McHenry and Science &amp; Engineering libraries</a> house 1.3 million bound volumes, access to more than 12,000 periodicals, newspapers and special materials, along with special materials such as manuscripts, maps, and slides.</p>
<p>Most library resources are available to the public; borrowing privileges are available with a contribution to the Friends of UCSC Library or by joining the Alumni Association. Special Collections at McHenry Library contains rare, valuable and often fragile materials that do not circulate but can be viewed by appointment. For library hours visit the library <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/">website</a>.</p>
<p>And these days, if your loud, rumbling stomach gets in the way of browsing the periodicals, you can stop and get a bite to eat at the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/global-village-cafe">Global Village Caf&#233;</a>. Located in the foyer of McHenry Library, the Global Village has indoor seating for 68, and a menu that includes salads, sandwiches, and desserts.</p>
<p><b>Staying fit and having fun in the summertime</b></p>
<p>The views from UCSC&#8217;s athletic training facilities and full-service gym are so stunning, you will forget how tired and sweaty you are. Whether you're running a lap on the bouncy half-mile outdoor track, or trying out some newfangled cardio machine in the facility formerly known as the Wellness Center, you will lose yourself in the scenery.</p>
<p>The UCSC OPERS Wellness program has changed its name to <a href="http://fitlife.ucsc.edu">UCSC FitLife</a>, but its facilities will continue to provide the same great recreational and fitness opportunities.

<p><b>Learning from the natural world</b></p>
<p>The famous <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">Arboretum</a> awaits you this summer, offering a world-class collection from flora around the globe, but during your visit to UCSC, don't overlook other beautiful areas, including The Farm as well as the Alan Chadwick Garden.</p>
<p>Visitors to the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">UCSC Arboretum</a> may stroll through its exotic gardens, go on a tour, or take part in scheduled events. Admission is $5 for adults and $2 for children, and free on the first Tuesday of each month.

<p>The Arboretum is located on Empire Grade between the campus's main and west entrances. Visit arboretum.ucsc.edu or call 427-2998 for more information.</p>
<p><a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/">The Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems</a> manages two locations: the 25-acre Farm near the main entrance to campus and the 2-acre Alan Chadwick Garden across McLaughlin Drive from Stevenson College.</p>

<p><b>Denizens of the deep</b></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re finished with your on-campus tour, check out a nearby westside Santa Cruz attraction. Visitors can view one of the largest whale skeletons displayed worldwide, touch living sea stars and hermit crabs, and enjoy spectacular views of the Monterey Bay at the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/visit/hours-admission/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a>, part of a UCSC marine research laboratory. Aquaria and exhibits feature the everyday tools of ocean exploration and focus on research done by scientists on site and around the world.

<p><b>Looking at the heavens</b></p>
<p>Once visitors have exhausted the possibilities on and near campus, they should hit the road for breathtaking views of the night skies, and soul-stirring concerts in a working observatory. The <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/">Lick Observatory</a> is located atop Mount Hamilton, east of San Jose and about 60 miles from campus. The visitor&#8217;s center and gift shop are open Thursday-Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. year round. The public is invited to view exhibits in the main observatory building, built in 1888.</p>
<p>Enjoy an informal talk about the observatory history while taking a look at the Great Lick Refractor in the 36-inch telescope dome. These talks begin at the gift shop and are held at 12:30, 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, and 4:30. No registration or ticket purchase is necessary. Each talk is 15 minutes long and is free of charge.</p>
<p>Visitors also are invited to take a short walk to the Shane Dome to view the 120-inch reflector from the Visitors' Gallery. Displays explain the Shane reflector, one of the major telescopes used to discover planets outside our solar system. Special events also are scheduled, including the annual and always popular <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/music.html">Music of the Spheres Concert Series</a> in June, July, and August. &#160;Do yourself a favor and plan well ahead; the concerts sell out quickly. Visitors should carry warm clothing and allow one hour to drive from San Jose. For more information, call (408) 274-5061.</p>

<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Previously, effective July 1, 2013, employees with a combination of age and years of service totaling less than 50 became subject to new retiree health benefits eligibility requirements (Rule of 50). The current change is in response to concerns of employees who fell into the new 2013 retiree health care eligibility rules, some by weeks or even days. </span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">There are now three categories of eligibility rules, each based on the date an individual becomes a member of UCRP or returns to UC employment after a break in service. The rules are outlined in the Retiree Health Eligibility Rules Fact Sheet available online, <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/forms/pdf/retiree-health-eligibility-fact-sheet.pdf">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/forms/pdf/retiree-health-eligibility-fact-sheet.pdf</a></span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The retiree health eligibility rules for represented employees are subject to collective bargaining and may be different. Union members should check their <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/labor/bargaining-units/">collective bargaining agreement</a> or consult with their local union representative if they have any questions. </span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">General questions concerning retiree health benefits may be directed to the campus Benefits Office at 459-2013. </span></p>

<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Para: Acad&#233;micos y empleados de UCSC <br/> De parte de:&#160; Lori Castro, Interim Assistant Vice Chancellor, Recursos Humanos Pamela Peterson, Assistant Vice Chancellor, Personal Acad&#233;mico<br/> Sobre:&#160; Elegibilidad para beneficios de salud para jubilados</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Me complace informar que el Presidente Napolitano aprob&#243; recientemente un cambio en las reglas de elegibilidad para los beneficios de salud de jubilados &#8212;profesores&#160; del Senado y empleados sin representaci&#243;n elegibles para UCRP&#160; contratados despu&#233;s de 01 de enero de 1990 y antes del 01 de julio de 2013 permanecer&#225;n bajo las reglas de elegibilidad en el lugar cuando fueron contratados.</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Previamente, apartir de 01 de julio de 2013, los empleados con una combinaci&#243;n de edad y a&#241;os de servicio que era en total menos de 50 eran sujeto a nuevos reglas para beneficios de salud cuando jubilado&#8212;requisitos de elegibilidad conocido de nombre &#8220;regla de 50&#8221; (en ingl&#233;s &#8220;Rule of 50&#8221;). El cambio actual es en respuesta a las preocupaciones de los trabajadores que cayeron debajo de esta nueva regla de elegibilidad, algunos debidos a semanas o incluso d&#237;as.</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Ahora hay tres categor&#237;as de las reglas de elegibilidad, cada uno basado en la fecha que un individuo se convierte en un miembro de la UCRP o devuelve al empleo de la UC despu&#233;s de una interrupci&#243;n de servicio. Las reglas se describen en el &#8220;Fact Sheet&#8221; llamada (en ingl&#233;s) Retiree Health Eligibility Rules, disponible en l&#237;nea: "<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/forms/pdf/retiree-health-eligibility-fact-sheet.pdf%E2%80%9D">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/forms/pdf/retiree-health-eligibility-fact-sheet.pdf&#8221;</a></span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Las reglas de elegibilidad de salud para jubilados para empleados representado por sindicatos est&#225;n sujetas a negociaci&#243;n colectiva y pueden ser diferentes. Miembros de una Uni&#243;n deber&#237;an revisar su convenio colectivo o si tienen alguna pregunta consulte con su representante local de la Uni&#243;n.</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Preguntas generales sobre beneficios de salud para jubilados pueden ser dirigidas al campus oficina de beneficios en 459-2013.</span></p>

<p>Visitors who wish to improve their expertise in lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, water polo and yoga, or would like to spend their summer hours close-reading <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> by Charles Dickens<a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/universe/index.html">, in the company of other Dickens lovers</a>, or lending their voices to an <a href="http://www.crystalchoir.org/pages/about-us.php">internationally touring choir</a>, or <a href="http://www.mandolinsymposium.com">playing a mandolin in very talented company</a>, will get their chance in the coming months.&#160;</p>
<p>Visiting students have the full range of campus living. They stay in campus housing and eat in college dining halls.</p>
<p><a href="http://conferenceservices.ucsc.edu/current/index.html">A full list of offerings</a> shows that conferences are geared to a wide array of talents, passions, hobbies and interests.</p>
<p>If you study the list, you will notice a strong emphasis this year on college preparatory courses.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.leadps.org">Leadership Public Schools</a> program will send high school students from Heyward, San Jose, and Oakland, for an immersive experience designed to familiarize them with the rigors of college as well as the layout and atmosphere of a college campus. This summer program is an extension of the LPS tuition-free charter schools dedicated to preparing students for college success and leadership.</p>
<p>Those who wish to rock may do so at the <a href="http://www.rockcamp.org">Soundwall</a> summer rock camp, a time to hone instrumental technique, &#160;learn music theory, music history, rehearsal techniques, ensemble skills, and performance practice. The homework might include close-listening to the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Beatles.</p>
<p>The conference line-up includes the <a href="http://www.usacamps.com">United Spirit Association</a> cheerleading and dance camp, which has been coming back to UC Santa Cruz for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>For the first time, UC Santa Cruz will host the <a href="http://4h.ucanr.edu/Programs/Conferences/SLC/">4-H State Leadership Conference</a>, bringing together high school students across the state to build leadership skills, network, and learn new skills, and the <a href="http://childlearnnature.com/wp-content/uploads/delightful-downloads/2014/04/Children-Learning-with-Nature-Training-Institute-8-page-program.pdf">2014 Learning with Nature Training Institute</a>,&#160; a gathering of leading educators from around the world coming together to share and exchange ideas about bringing nature into children&#8217;s lives. The conference is of special interest to environmental educators, health officials, landscape designers, outdoor play consultants, policy makers, researchers, and students.</p>
<p>The average gross revenue of over $4 million, generated within a 10-week period, goes to UCSC&#8217;s housing system and helps offset what students pay during the academic year for housing and dining.</p>
<p>Zaunna Wells, operations manager for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Conference Services, said UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s beautiful setting makes it a steady draw for youth and sports camps, which comprise &#8220;the bulk of our business&#8221; during the conference season, while the campus&#8217;s strong academic reputation allows it to draw conferences including the John Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, which offers high level courses for exceptionally bright students in two intensive three-week sessions.</p>

They were presented earlier this month during Santa Cruz Pride 2014 events. In addition, Abbott received special recognition from the California State Senate, the Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors, and the Santa Cruz City Council.<br/><br/>Abbott, who grew up in Monterey, recalled that her earliest activism was in junior high when she joined United Farm Worker's Union founder Cesar Chavez&#8217; grape boycott picket line at Safeway. At 17, she moved to Santa Cruz to attend UC Santa Cruz. After graduation, she became a member of the Santa Cruz Women's Health Collective. She said she became aware of her lesbianism as she worked with lesbian members of the collective on issues involving women's reproductive rights and lesbian health inequities. <br/><br/>She came out to her husband, friends, and family in her mid-20s. "I realized there were no resources to help married lesbians or bisexual women in their complex coming-out process," she said. In 1995, she co-authored <em>From Wedded Wife to Lesbian Life</em>, an anthology of 43 women's stories. The book became a "lesbian best seller," she said.&#160; Abbott raised two sons during a time when there was lack of acceptance by both straight and queer communities. Abbott led advocacy efforts to support other queer parents and to increase acceptance of LGBTQ families.<br/><br/>Abbott later became founding executive director of WomenCARE &#8212; a local resource center for women with cancer where she developed outreach projects to ensure the organization&#8217;s resources were accessible to queer women with cancer. <br/><br/>Abbott received a master&#8217;s degree in clinical psychology and became licensed as a psychotherapist in 1990; she has maintained a private practice for the past 24 years, specializing in working with LGBTQ clients. She was one of the first therapists in the region to work with transgender clients.<br/><br/>Over her 17 years as director, the Cant&#250; Queer Center has served thousands of students, Abbott said, and UC Santa Cruz is consistently ranked one of the top universities for LGBTQ students.

It's been approved for a three-year trial phase. College Eight Provost Ronnie Lipschutz said the minor will focus primarily "on the built environment" with the goal of providing students with hands-on skills and experience they might not receive in their majors, particularly majors outside of environmental studies. <br/><br/>"There is a considerable amount of student interest in sustainability," said Lipschutz, a politics professor. And there is considerable interest from employers in graduates who have broad problem-solving skills. <br/><br/>The minor took about two years from initial design to final approval but the seeds were planted in 2007 when Lipschutz and a group of faculty organized Sustainability Engineering and Ecological Design (SEED) with the goal of creating new courses in sustainability. <br/><br/>SEED is a collaboration between the Baskin School of Engineering and the Social Sciences division made up of faculty, graduate students, and research staff in electrical engineering, environmental studies, politics and sociology, core subjects for the sustainability studies minor. <br/><br/>Lipschutz said faculty had hoped for campus funding but the initiative was getting organized at the same time as UC and UC Santa Cruz began several years of significant budget cuts. When funding was not forthcoming, faculty raised more than $1 million from the National Science Foundation and other sources and were able to establish several classes, he said.<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz has a tradition of college-based classes and sustainability studies seemed to fit the model, Lipschutz said. "One of my goals as provost was to formalize a curriculum that did not compete with other departments or majors, and College 8 seemed an appropriate place to do this." <br/><br/>Lipschutz said he wants to get "students to think in terms of broad problem-solving rather than narrow disciplines." Students will undertake many research and service learning internships to encourage personal and collaborative projects.<br/><br/>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to put more STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) into it," Lipschutz said, "and trying to make it more hands-on and provide students with certain capabilities they could use if they wanted to go into specific professions. I&#8217;m building on notions of the green economy and green entrepreneurship, so it&#8217;s oriented in some ways to more modern professional tracks.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://eight.ucsc.edu/academic-programs/Minor%20in%20Sustainability%20Studies.html </url><title>Sustainability minor website</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d4a18143807270461ae4b3b885152311"><name>summer-construction</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Summer 2014 major construction impacts</title><summary>Every summer Physical Planning and Construction and Physical Plant undertake capital improvement and maintenance projects that support and upgrade the campus infrastructure and buildings.</summary><start-date>1403679600000</start-date><display-name>Summer 2014 major construction impacts</display-name><path>/2014/06/summer-construction</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/summer-construction</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1403726692601</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1403742356001</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Every summer Physical Planning and Construction and Physical Plant undertake capital improvement and maintenance projects that support and upgrade the campus infrastructure and buildings.

Beginning next week, July 1, the UC Santa Cruz Fire Department will be reorganized and fire suppression services for the campus will be consolidated with and provided by the City of Santa Cruz. Details of the change as announced by the university and city may be found <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/06/images/uc_sc_fire.pdf">here</a>.<br/> <br/> All emergency protocols will remain the same with respect to 9-1-1 services and the campus fire station will continue to be operated and staffed by Santa Cruz City fire personnel.<br/> <br/> UC Santa Cruz has been one of only two UC campuses and one of only a few campuses across the country with a fire department. In September 2011, the city and campus collaborated to develop a shared management agreement for fire operations. Effective January 2012, both entities began sharing a fire chief, Jeff Trapp. <br/> <br/> Both entities also began exploring additional fire consolidation opportunities and engaged Citygate Associates to conduct an in-depth feasibility analysis. Completed in spring 2013, the analysis revealed that a full consolidation would benefit the campus and the city.&#160; Citygate outlined the challenges facing small fire departments with limited headquarters staffing. Such operations are fragile and difficult to sustain over time, as limited absences or turnover result in risk and reliance on overtime to ensure staffing ratios. In addition, fire services have become more specialized with increased safety requirements, adding pressure on small fire units. <br/> <br/> As a result of the Citygate study, the campus and city began discussions to determine what a potential consolidation would look like. In the months that followed, additional consolidation efforts were undertaken as pilot studies to assess operational feasibility.&#160; The largest was in January 2014, when the city and campus did a full personnel swap, with city employees assigned to the campus station and all campus fire personnel assigned to off-campus stations. Also during this time a UC Santa Cruz administrative team worked with city counterparts to develop a framework for a full consolidation.<br/> <br/> Several services formerly under the UC Santa Cruz Fire Department will remain with the campus and be reassigned to Risk and Safety Services.&#160; This unit will be called the Office of Emergency Services (OES) and report to the associate vice chancellor, Risk and Safety Services.&#160; The new OES team will comprise Emergency Management, Business Continuity Planning, and the campus Fire Marshal.&#160; The OES offices will be located in the Carriage House.<br/> <br/> The city will maintain the same fire suppression services that were provided by our campus fire department. OES will continue to provide emergency preparedness and fire safety training. The emergency manager will be the campus internal contact for any service questions about city fire suppression services and will assist the campus community in ensuring the quality of emergency response. <br/> <br/> This consolidation has been three years in the making and has required the engagement and expertise of countless individuals.&#160; It has been a pleasure to work with city colleagues, and we look forward to collaborating in the future as we find new ways to partner. Thanks to the efforts of everyone in the UC Santa Cruz and City of Santa Cruz fire departments and OES, we anticipate a smooth implementation.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Jeff Trapp, UC Santa Cruz / City of Santa Cruz Fire Chief and  Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor Risk and Safety Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d8d0a5f6807270461ae4b3b8935626da"><name>aaron-reed</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC graduate student is a new kind of storyteller</title><summary>Aaron Reed's award-winning games use computer technology to explore the possibilities of interactive fiction.</summary><keywords>Aaron A.

Reed</a> is a storyteller for whom writing involves both words and computer code. Currently working toward his Ph.D. in computer science at UC Santa Cruz, Reed is already a prominent author in the world of interactive fiction, merging literary storytelling techniques with the technology of computer games.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telling stories with words is one of the oldest ways that we have of telling stories, and telling stories with games is one of the newest ways,&#8221; Reed said. &#8220;Some of this stuff we figured out how to do over the last several thousand years, so what of that knowledge can we bring into this new ground?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reed came to UCSC in 2009 for the <a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu/">Digital Arts and New Media</a> program, earning his M.F.A. in 2011. His initial exploration of new ways of storytelling through games had two goals: to involve the reader in the outcome of the story and to develop an interactive story in a way that didn&#8217;t require a Ph.D. in computer science. Eventually, however, he decided that advanced work in computer science would give him the best tools to address some of the storytelling challenges he was facing as a writer. So he moved on to UCSC's computer science graduate program, working with faculty in the <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a> at the <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive storytelling</strong></p>
<p>Reed&#8217;s games experiment with different approaches to interactive storytelling, and the experiments are paying off. One recent project, <a href="http://18cadence.textories.com/home.html"><i>18 Cadence</i></a><i>,</i> has earned <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/18-cadence-aaron-reeds-ipad-storymaking-game-meets-success-igf-and-kirkus">accolades</a> from both the literary community and experimental game developers.</p>
<p>Interactive fiction (IF) has its origins in the analog world of print with books like the "Choose Your Own Adventure" series popular in the 1980s and 90s. Readers of those books encounter decision points throughout the story, and their choices send them to different pages to continue reading, influencing the outcome of the story.</p>
<p>Today, a vibrant <a href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page">online community</a> exists for writers and developers of interactive fiction, which is being produced in a variety of digital forms. One form involves a player typing commands to a character in the story, like &#8220;get key&#8221; or &#8220;go east.&#8221; Reed experimented with this type of storytelling in <a href="http://blue-lacuna.textories.com/index.html"><i>Blue Lacuna</i></a><i>,</i> a long-form interactive novel released in 2008 and <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ez2mcyx4zi98qlkh">acclaimed</a> by the IF community.</p>
<p>Reed said he thinks interactive fiction structured like a &#8220;Choose Your Own Adventure&#8221; book can be problematic for both players and writers. Gamers are always aware that a decision causes them to miss part of the story, and writers have to produce content that a gamer may never see. A structure that engages players in an expanding storyline by creating branching plots at each decision point burdens writers with ever-expanding content development.</p>
<p><strong>18 Cadence</strong></p>
<p>Reed has been exploring new ways of engaging the player in the story without tasking the writer (usually him) to generate overwhelming amounts of content. In <a href="http://18cadence.textories.com/home.html"><i>18 Cadence</i></a><i>,</i> for example, players move fragments of narrative around the screen as if they were magnetic refrigerator poetry. It gives players the ability to mold a story like sculpture and create a personalized narrative with the words Reed provided in the game.</p>
<p>The narrative fragments in <i>18 Cadence</i> are people, locations, and objects inside one fictional house throughout a century. A player chooses how to juxtapose fragments from each category, and the game merges connectable fragments into sentences. Players continue creating sentences to make a story, which they can choose to share with others.</p>
<p>Reed said that in reading the shared stories, he has been surprised by some of the ways in which people use the game. Some have stacked words on top of each other to make new sentences. Others created a collage of things that had been in the kitchen over the 100 years from when the house was built, in 1900, to when it burned down in 2000. These inventive uses fulfilled one of Reed&#8217;s main goals for his projects: that someone reading an interactive story feels like they are collaborating with him.</p>
<p><i>Kirkus Reviews,</i> a leading magazine for the book industry, named <i>18 Cadence</i> one of the best book apps for 2013, and the game won an honorable mention in the 2014 Independent Games Festival. Reed said he was pleased that experimental gamers recognized the novelty of his experiment, while the literary community also thought the game was worthy of recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Ice-Bound</strong></p>
<p>His latest project, <a href="http://aaronareed.net/ice-bound/"><i>Ice-Bound</i></a><i>,</i> has not been released publicly yet, but it has already earned Reed honors at UCSC. In May, he received the Alumni Association Award in engineering for his presentation at the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/symposium-awards.html">Graduate Student Research Symposium</a>. He has just submitted <i>Ice-Bound</i> to <a href="http://www.indiecade.com/">IndieCade</a>, the International Independent Games Festival held in October. Reed is developing the tablet-based game together with Jacob Garbe, another writer from the DANM M.F.A. program who also moved to the computer science department to continue doing games research.</p>
<p>The premise of <i>Ice-Bound</i> involves an author&#8217;s unfinished masterpiece that becomes popular decades after his death. To satisfy readers&#8217; demands for an ending, a publishing company recreates the author using artificial intelligence (AI) and asks the AI to finish the book. The AI author soon becomes consumed by self-doubt regarding the proper ending, and players provide information to alleviate that doubt. The game uses that information to identify possible trajectories for the rest of the virtual story.</p>
<p><i>Ice-Bound</i> changes the mechanics of a standard &#8220;Choose Your Own Adventure&#8221; game because the game doesn't follow a set path based on a player&#8217;s decision. It also continues the idea of sculptural storytelling that Reed explored with <i>18 Cadence.</i></p>
<p>Reed explained that in addition to releasing finished products, some of what he and other researchers at the Center for Games and Playable Media are doing is the game design equivalent of pure research. For-profit game developers can&#8217;t necessarily afford to create experimental games just to test a storytelling idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think games will be&#8212;or maybe already are&#8212;the dominant medium of the 21st century,&#8221; Reed said. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot to learn about how they can be most effective at conveying information and how they might change the way people think about a story or a system.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Reed, players&#8217; reactions determine whether he considers a game successful. He hopes people enjoy interacting with his games and are inspired to make something similar.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://aaronareed.net/</url><title>Aaron Reed's web site</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Center for Games and Playable Media</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis</url><title>Expressive Intelligence Studio</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="da16cd44807270461ae4b3b803eeeee6"><name>optometry-services</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Optometry services available for UCSC faculty and staff at the Student Health Center</title><summary>The UCSC Student Health Services is happy to announce that Optometry Services are available to UCSC faculty and staff at the Student Health Center starting immediately.</summary><start-date>1403766000000</start-date><display-name>Optometry Services Available</display-name><path>/2014/06/optometry-services</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/optometry-services</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1403818265884</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1403819536697</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><b>Optometry Services Available for UCSC Faculty and Staff at the Student Health Center</b></p>
<p>The UCSC Student Health Services is happy to announce that Optometry Services are available to UCSC faculty and staff at the Student Health Center starting immediately.</p>
<p>In 2013-2014, UCSC Student Health Services collaborated with the UC Berkeley School of Optometry to provide optometry services to UCSC students.&#160; We have recently expanded the service to include UCSC faculty and staff and can take the VSP vision insurance.&#160; A UCB faculty optometrist and senior UCB optometry interns are available by appointment on Mondays 8:30a-4:30p and Tuesdays 9:30a-4:30p. We are closed for lunch from 12p-1p.</p>
<p>Outside prescriptions for glasses and contacts are welcome &#8211; orders can be placed for you.</p>
<p>To make an optometry appointment, please call the Student Health Insurance Office at 831-459-5142. Payment is required on the day of service.</p>
<p>Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For medical eye related conditions (i.e. pink eye, or chronic medical eye conditions such as glaucoma, etc.), faculty and staff will be referred out to the appropriate providers or urgent care as needed</li>
<li>Services are for faculty and staff only, not dependents</li>
<li>We encourage faculty and staff to schedule optometry services during summer and quarter breaks.&#160; During the academic year, students will get first choice of appointments</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the UCSC Student Health Services Website for more information.</p>
<p>http://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/optometry.html</p>
<p><b>Tips For Your Next Optometry Visit</b></p>
<p>1. If you wear contact lenses, please wear your contact lenses to your appointment and bring your contact lens boxes or previous prescription if possible.</p>
<p>2. Bring your prescription eyeglasses to your appointment and previous prescription if possible.</p>
<p>3. If you scheduled an annual eye exam, plan to have your eyes dilated. A dilation allows the optometrist to better assess the health of the back of your eye. After the dilation, you will not be able to read clearly and you'll be sensitive to light. Your eyes will return to normal in approximately 4 to 6 hours. Please bring sunglasses and do not plan to drive until your eyes return to normal.</p>

Lin, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has been chosen to receive the 2014 Brouwer Award for outstanding contributions to the field of dynamical astronomy. The Brouwer award is bestowed annually by the <a href="http://dda.aas.org/index.html">Division on Dynamical Astronomy</a> of the <a href="http://aas.org/">American Astronomical Society</a>.</p>
<p>Lin is best known for his pioneering work on the origin and evolution of planetary systems. He has made fundamental contributions to the understanding of astrophysical disks, including protoplanetary disks (the disks of gas and dust from which planets form around stars), the rings of Saturn, spiral disk galaxies, and the accretion rings around black holes that power quasars.</p>
<p>Lin's greatest impact has been in the field of planet formation and the booming field of extrasolar planets, according to the <a href="http://dda.aas.org/brouwer_award/brouw2014.html">citation</a> accompanying the Brouwer Award: "Early on, Doug realized that accretion disk modeling with turbulent angular momentum transport needs to be applied to protoplanetary disks in order to understand the environment for planet formation. He developed the formalism (the so-called 'alpha' models) that is still used today to describe the evolution of these disks."</p>
<p>Lin will receive the award and give the Brouwer lecture at the next meeting of the AAS Division on Dynamical Astronomy in April 2015 in Pasadena.</p>
<p>An honorary fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Lin served as the founding director of the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University in Beijing, China. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award from the UCSC Division of Physical and Biological Sciences in 2008. Lin has been a member of the astronomy faculty at UC Santa Cruz since 1979.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

California, Santa Cruz will establish an endowment to support the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, the nation's first hands-on training program for beginning organic farmers at a public university. <br/><br/>The apprenticeship is one of the core programs of the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu">Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS)</a> at UC Santa Cruz and has earned an international reputation for the skill and knowledge of its instructors and researchers for more than 45 years. <br/><br/>The Center also serves undergraduates and the public, and is dedicated to increasing ecological sustainability and social justice in the food system, while creating the next generation of leaders in sustainable agriculture. <br/><br/>This gift, from an anonymous donor, is the first step in building a $10-million endowment that will ensure the Center's long-term productivity and impact. <br/><br/>"The Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz is the nation's leading university program in sustainable agriculture and food systems," said Daniel Press, CASFS executive director and the Olga T. Griswold professor of environmental studies. "This generous gift will help ensure that it continues to be."</p>
<p><strong>Incubator for innovation</strong></p>
<p>"We are an incubator for innovation in organic and sustainable agriculture,&#8221; said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of the UC Santa Cruz Division of Social Sciences. "UC Santa Cruz has been ahead of the curve for more than 45 years and our influence proves you don&#8217;t have to be a big ag school to have major impacts on farming and food distribution.&#8221;<br/><br/>The Center and its programs are part of the Coastal Sustainability initiative of <a href="http://campaign.ucsc.edu/">The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</a>. Annual payouts from the endowment will be used to cover costs for salaries, educational expenses, materials, and equipment.</p>
<p>Work at UC Santa Cruz in sustainable agriculture and food justice are key components of the <a href="http://ucop.edu/initiatives/global-food-initiative.html">UC Global Food Initiative</a> announced July 1.</p>
<p>Founded in 1967, the Center operates the three-acre Alan Chadwick Garden and the 30-acre UC Santa Cruz Farm, which serve as research, teaching, and training facilities. Each April, a new crop of apprentices comes to UC Santa Cruz to live and work on the Farm for six months. <br/><br/>This year's 39 first-year apprentices hail from across the country and bring with them a variety of life experiences. They are united by a single passion: to learn how to produce healthy food for their communities and empower others to do so as well.<br/><br/>Apprentices get approximately 300 hours of classroom instruction and 700 hours of in-field training and experience in greenhouses, gardens, orchards, and fields. In addition to learning soil science and a comprehensive suite of organic farming and gardening skills, apprentices also study business practices and direct marketing techniques for small farmers. And they gain a conceptual grounding in social and environmental issues in agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>1,500 graduates</strong></p>
<p>The program now boasts nearly 1,500 graduates who have established their own commercial farms and market gardens, organized and run community gardens for inner city and prison populations, and developed school gardening programs. Many graduates take part in international development projects, including programs in Nepal, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, and throughout Central and South America. Others have raised the standards of the organic food industry through work with certification programs and retailers.<br/><br/>The Center and Farm and Garden also serve thousands of UC Santa Cruz undergraduates through more than 30 classes; plus internships, service learning, and campus events. Hundreds of community members visit the Farm each year for organic gardening workshops, events, and tours. <br/><br/>An on-site affiliate, Life Lab, uses the Farm for K&#8211;12 school tours, teacher trainings, summer camps, and the &#8220;Food What?&#8221; youth empowerment program. <br/><br/>Finally, the Center advances both theoretical and applied research. Researchers working with CASFS are at the forefront of efforts to develop and advance sustainable food and agricultural systems that will serve as a foundation for future generations.<br/><br/></p>

Payouts will be used to ensure the long-term viability of the apprenticeship program and other related training programs at the UC Santa Cruz Farm and the Alan Chadwick Garden. Among other things, funds will be applied to tuition scholarships for apprentices.<br/><br/> CASFS is a research, education, and public service program dedicated to increasing ecological sustainability and social justice in the food and agriculture system. The center operates the three-acre Alan Chadwick Garden and the 30-acre UC Santa Cruz Farm, which serve as research, teaching, and training facilities. It contributes knowledge to create agricultural and food systems that sustain both human communities and the environment. Cutting-edge research, the internationally renowned apprenticeship program, and effective public outreach place the center and UC Santa Cruz at the forefront of sustainable agriculture. <br/><br/> Founded in 1967 and run in conjunction with UC Santa Cruz Extension, the apprenticeship is a full-time program over six months that provides training in the concepts and practices of organic gardening and small-scale farming. Many apprentices go on to train others across the country and around the world in hands-on projects. Graduates have also established their own commercial farms and market gardens, run community gardens for inner city and prison populations, and developed school gardening programs. Others have raised the standards of the organic food industry through work with certification programs and retailers.<br/><br/> This incredibly generous $4 million endowment underscores the importance of CASFS and the apprenticeship to the UC Santa Cruz campus in several ways. First, it enhances the campus&#8217;s already strong national and international reputation as a global leader in organic agriculture and sustainable food systems, environmental responsibility, and social justice. Second, it shines a bright spotlight on the world-class social science and scientific research and education that is taking place on the UC Santa Cruz Farm. Finally, it enhances the student experience and coastal sustainability, two major priorities in the campus&#8217;s current comprehensive fundraising campaign.<br/><br/> Many thanks to Professor Daniel Press in Environmental Studies, executive director of CASFS, and Jeff Shilling, associate vice chancellor for strategic philanthropy. Future apprentices will benefit greatly as a result of their hard work.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Sheldon Kamieniecki, Dean, Division of Social Sciences</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="77d389558072704607f15f7f5a4f950e"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><start-date>1325408400000</start-date><path>/2014/06/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/06/index</link><created-by>raknight</created-by><created-on>1389284788540</created-on><last-modified-by>raknight</last-modified-by><last-modified>1389284788540</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
