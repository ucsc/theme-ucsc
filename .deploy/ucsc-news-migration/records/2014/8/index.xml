cores collected in 1960s by UC Santa Cruz geologist Gary Griggs for his Ph.D. thesis have attracted renewed scrutiny for clues to Cascadia earthquakes</article-subhead><article-text><p>Gary Griggs began studying sediment deposits on the deep-sea floor off the Oregon coast in 1965 as a graduate student in oceanography at Oregon State University. Now, almost 50 years later, Griggs is a distinguished professor of Earth and planetary sciences and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, and the sediment cores he collected as a grad student have led geologists to rethink their ideas about earthquake hazards in the Pacific Northwest. &#160;</p>
<p>It wasn't until 1990 that the distinctive sediment layers Griggs and his colleagues observed were recognized as evidence of massive earthquakes that occurred centuries ago. A new study published July 29 in <i><a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2014/07/29/G35902.1.abstract">Geology</a></i> reexamines that evidence and its implications.</p>
<p>"Science has come a long way in the past half century. When I was a graduate student we didn't have the benefit of plate tectonics and no understanding of the potential for big earthquakes in that area," said Griggs, a coauthor of the new paper.</p>
<p>The report focuses on the Cascadia subduction zone&#8212;a giant active fault that slants eastward beneath the Pacific coast of southern British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and northern California. The lead author is Brian Atwater of the U.S. Geological Survey, an expert on Cascadia earthquakes who contacted Griggs several years ago to learn more about the sediment cores he had collected as a graduate student.</p>
<p>Geologic studies in the past three decades have provided increasingly specific estimates of Cascadia earthquake sizes and repeat times. The estimates affect public safety through seismic provisions in building design and tsunami limits on evacuation maps. At issue is not whether the Cascadia subduction zone produces enormous earthquakes repeatedly. It is widely held, for instance, that the zone last ruptured along most of its 700-mile length in January 1700, in an earthquake of estimated magnitude 9. The new report does not question this consensus. What the report asks instead is how much geologists can say, with confidence, about Cascadia earthquake history before 1700.</p>
<p>"The question is whether we get magnitude 8 earthquakes every 300 years or magnitude 9 earthquakes every 500 years, and that's important because it's been over 300 years since the last very large quake and tsunami," Griggs said. "It may be more complicated than people once thought to determine exactly when those past earthquakes occurred."</p>
<p>The new report reappraises sediment cores that were collected near the foot of the continental slope offshore Washington. Several cores from this area underpin influential estimates of Cascadia earthquake size and recurrence that were <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1661f/">published in 2012</a>. The new report points to confounding evidence from a much larger suite of cores that were collected and first analyzed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including those collected by Griggs.</p>
<p>At that time, plate tectonics was such a new idea that scientists were just beginning to recognize the Cascadia subduction zone as a tectonic plate boundary. The sediment cores were collected to learn about turbidites&#8212;beds of sand and mud laid down by bottom-hugging, sediment-driven currents that infrequently emerged from submarine canyons onto the deep ocean floor. Not until a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/TC009i004p00569/abstract">1990 report</a> would turbidites be reinterpreted as clues to Cascadia earthquake history.</p>
<p>The new report asks how well geologists have managed to read this earthquake history. Which earthquakes represent long ruptures and which represent sequential, shorter breaks? Do earthquakes happen more often here than there? The report concludes that extracting such details from turbidites at Cascadia is more complicated than was previously thought.</p>
<p>For Griggs, the new developments show how important it is to keep good research records. "Even if you don't have the answer at the time, if you do careful work others can come along later and reevaluate the evidence in the light of new models and understanding," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to Atwater and Griggs, the coauthors of the paper include Bobb Carson, who worked with Griggs on the sediment cores as a graduate student at the University of Washington and is now retired from Lehigh University; and Paul Johnson and Marie Salmi of the University of Washington.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a332e0ab807270461ae4b3b8fae74119"><name>gill-agu-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Earth scientist James Gill elected fellow of the American Geophysical Union</title><summary>James Gill, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, has been elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).</summary><keywords>James Gill, Jim Gill</keywords><start-date>1407135600000</start-date><display-name>Earth scientist James Gill elected fellow of the American Geophysical Union</display-name><path>/2014/08/gill-agu-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/gill-agu-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1407192326251</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1407452104074</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/james-gill.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/james-gill.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>james-gill.jpg</name><display-name>james-gill.jpg</display-name><file-size>23880</file-size><width>260</width><height>250</height></image><image-alt>James Gill</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/james-gill-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/james-gill-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>james-gill-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>james-gill-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>19902</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>James Gill</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>James Gill</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>James Gill, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

with Dickens book at Dickens Universe</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz Literature Professor John Jordan today announced an endowment drive to support the <a href="http://dickens.ucsc.edu/index.html"><em><strong>Dickens Project</strong></em></a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Jordan, director and co-founder of the Dickens Project, shared the news at the annual <b>Dickens Universe</b> gathering now taking place on campus--a unique weeklong event that is part festival, book club, academic conference, and summer camp.</p>
<p>Running this year at UC Santa Cruz from August 3-9, the Dickens Universe brings together a wide array of participants from across the country--ranging from college faculty and students, to high school teachers and anyone else with an inclination or yearning to study Dickens.</p>
<p>Jordan said that the endowment drive is being conducted on behalf of the Friends of the Dickens Project, the group that supports the activities and operation of the Project, including the annual Dickens Universe.</p>
<p>A scholarly consortium headquartered at UC Santa Cruz, <b>The Dickens Project</b> consists of members from more than 40 universities across the United States and around the globe.&#160;It is internationally recognized as the premier center for Dickens studies in the world and is one of the leading sites for research on 19th-century British culture.</p>
<p>Jordan noted that a major reason for launching the drive now is to help give the Project greater stability at a time of transition in leadership.</p>
<p>One specific use of the income from the endowment will be to provide a stipend for a new director. Jordan retired from the UC Santa Cruz faculty a year ago, but remained on as Dickens Project Director. He currently serves without stipend, but plans to step down by 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Friends already have a small endowment, but the drive aims to increase that amount to $1 million over the next few years,&#8221; said Jordan. The ultimate purpose of the drive is to keep the Dickens Project financially secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although it no longer receives support from the UC Office of the President, Jordan said that the Dickens Project is currently healthy and thriving.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Project is in good financial condition,&#8221; said Jordan. &#8220;It&#8217;s funding comes from three principal sources: Dickens Universe registrations; private gifts, especially from the Friends of the Dickens Project; and membership dues from the more than 40 colleges and universities that make up the DP consortium.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dickens Universe registration remains strong--we sold out for this summer,&#8221; Jordan added. &#8220;New schools continue to express interest in joining the Project. Member institutions come from public and private universities in the U.S. as well as from overseas, including Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and Israel.&#8220;</p>
<p>The reputation of the Dickens Project has also spread wider in recent years, thanks in part to a feature article by Jill Lepore that appeared in the <b><i>New Yorker</i></b> magazine. Titled <i>Dickens in Eden: Summer Vacation with &#8216;Great Expectations</i>,' the story described Lepore&#8217;s experience as an attendee at the 2011 Dickens Universe.</p>
<p>Earlier that same year, Pulitzer Prize-winning author <b>Jane Smiley</b> also praised the Dickens Universe during an interview with <b>Oprah Winfrey</b>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now in its 34th year of operation, the Dickens Project is a remarkable institution,&#8221; Jordan noted. &#8220;It supports innovative research on Dickens and 19th-century culture, it promotes the professional development of graduate students, and it provides outreach to a large cross-section of the general public.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The annual Dickens Universe gathering is the most important annual scholarly conference on Dickens in the world,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In addition to its significance as a scholarly venue, the Universe is also lots of fun&#8212;it attracts people of every age, from high school students and undergraduates to senior citizens.&#8221;</p>
<p>The secret ingredient, of course, is Dickens--a writer of extraordinary breadth and power who nevertheless remains accessible to ordinary readers.</p>
<p>&#8220;No other writer in English, I believe, with the exception of Shakespeare and perhaps Jane Austen, could sustain this kind of scholarly and public attention for so long a time,&#8221; Jordan observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 34 years, the Dickens Project is still going strong. And it has a glorious future too,&#8221; he added.</p>

Sautter Award for using information technology to make university operations more effective and efficient to better serve faculty, staff, students, and patients. It is one of three to win a golden award. <br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz partnered with private industry to win a $10.6 million state Public Utilities Commission grant in April to build the fiber-optic network that will enable high-quality network connectivity on campus and along the Central Coast down to Soledad. <br/><br/>Brad Smith, UCSC's director of research and faculty partnerships in Information Technology Services, said the state was seeking proposals to increase broadband access to areas with poor service. The university, meanwhile, saw the need for another high-speed information pipeline so it wasn't reliant on a single line coming over the hill from Sunnyvale. <br/><br/>That line was installed four years ago in a collaborative effort with the university and others, and linked the UC Santa Cruz campus to the California Research and Education Network (CalREN).&#160; The new fiber-optic line will be installed over the next two years<br/><br/>To win the grant, Smith and Jim Warner, a UCSC network engineer, visited Monterey County communities, tested Internet service levels and completed surveys and a data analysis to demonstrate that existing networks were not providing service at a level that matched their coverage claims.<br/><br/>Established in 2000, the IT award is named for Larry L. Sautter, a UC Riverside associate vice chancellor for computing and communications who died in 1999.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2014/08/ten-projects-win-ucs-2014-information-technology-awards-.html</url><title>University of California press release </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/fiber-extention.html</url><title>Previous coverage</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a849807b807270461ae4b3b8c53eddf2"><name>volunteer-profile-panagopoulos</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Volunteer profile: Beata Panagopoulos </title><summary>In addition to having fun, I volunteer because I would like UC Santa Cruz alums to have a strong network they can rely on after they graduate. </summary><keywords>Beata Panagopoulos </keywords><start-date>1407276000000</start-date><display-name>Volunteer profile: Beata Panagopoulos </display-name><path>/2014/08/volunteer-profile-panagopoulos</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/volunteer-profile-panagopoulos</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1407277695033</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1413326558371</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Volunteer Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/panagopoulos-beata.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/panagopoulos-beata.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>panagopoulos-beata.jpg</name><display-name>panagopoulos-beata.jpg</display-name><file-size>80660</file-size><width>300</width><height>200</height></image><image-alt>Beata Panagopoulos </image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/panagopoulos-beata-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/panagopoulos-beata-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>panagopoulos-beata-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>panagopoulos-beata-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28869</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Beata Panagopoulos </image-thumb-alt><image-caption>"I feel the utmost gratitude to have benefited from a superb education at a public institution, and I want to give back however I can," says volunteer&#160;Beata Panagopoulos of Boston.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Cowell '75, politics</em></p>

<h3>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>I love volunteering with the Boston regional chapter of the UC Alumni Association (BSLUGS) for a number of reasons. At this point, the BSLUGS is an established group with regulars who attend many of our events. We are practically family. I enjoy collaborating and socializing with these old friends, some of whom were undergrads at UC Santa Cruz when I was there. (There is actually a sizable contingent of alums in the Boston area who are librarians, so I already have a lot in common with them.) Meeting the people who have more recently discovered the BSLUGS is also a highlight of my involvement with the group. The reasons UC Santa Cruz grads find their ways to New England are many and varied. I am inspired by their stories of how UC Santa Cruz transformed their lives and helped them discover their paths in life.</p>
<p>In addition to having fun, I volunteer because I would like UC Santa Cruz alums to have a strong network they can rely on after they graduate. I feel the utmost gratitude to have benefited from a superb education at a public institution, and I want to give back however I can.</p>
<h3>Why types of things do you do as a Slug volunteer?</h3>
<p>I work with the other members of the BSLUG board to create opportunities for UC Santa Cruz graduates in the New England area to get together, attend cultural events, hear UC Santa Cruz-affiliated speakers, and support the Smith Renaissance Society.</p>
<p>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</p>
<p>Being a UC Santa Cruz graduate is something I'm very proud of&#8212;it is a major part of my identity. Volunteering for UC Santa Cruz keeps that connection alive for me.</p>
<h3>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>There are many ways to volunteer depending on where you live and what you enjoy doing. UC Santa Cruz has a wonderful support team for alumni volunteers. If you don't know how to get started forming your own chapter or contributing to one that's already established, contact the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association. All it takes is some initiative and creativity to get involved.</p>
<h3>What's your best memory from your time at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>The two best memories I have are bookends of my years at UC Santa Cruz. The very first day I was on campus, I stood in a winding line to get into the Cowell dining hall for dinner. In front of me was a cool woman with a long, thick braid of hair, wearing a wool poncho. I tapped her on the shoulder and introduced myself. We became fast friends during our time at Santa Cruz, including our junior year abroad in Europe. Now, four decades later, I am still close friends with Christine Poggi, a professor of art history at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>During my last year at UCSC, I took John Schaar's class on American Political Thought. He was an unforgettable teacher, lecturing in a mesmerizing oratorical style. I felt as if I was part of a major reinterpretation of American history that put the concepts of community, democracy, and political participation at its heart. I also remember anti-war protests at the quarry with the activist leaders wearing pink "Eat the Rich" T-shirts, Cowell waltzes, and dancing to the music of Oganooki. And oh, those gorgeous purple and scarlet sunsets over the silver Pacific!</p>

<p>Akeson leads the UC Santa Cruz nanopore group, which has spent years developing technology to analyze DNA strands as they pass through a tiny pore in a membrane, called a "nanopore" because it is just 1.5 nanometers wide at its narrowest point. (A nanometer is one billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 100,000 nanometers wide.) Akeson's group has made important advances in nanopore sequencing technology, and research funded by the new grant could have valuable applications in biomedical research.</p>
<p>The project will focus on optimization of enzymes, pores, and computational methods for nanopore sequencing of individual DNA molecules taken directly from the nucleus of a cell. The UCSC group uses a nanopore formed by a self-assembling protein complex called an ion channel, inserted into a membrane similar to a cell membrane. An electric field drives DNA strands (which are negatively charged) through the nanopore, and blockage of the nanopore as a strand passes through produces electrical current modulations that can be analyzed to yield DNA sequence information.</p>
<p>One of the challenges has been controlling the movement of the DNA through the nanopore. With an unconstrained DNA strand, each subunit (called a nucleotide) zips through the pore in about three microseconds, too fast to get an accurate reading. Akeson's group developed an approach using enzymes that bind to the DNA to control its movement through the nanopore.</p>
<p>In effect, the nanopore serves as a sensor that touches and examines each nucleotide within a captured DNA strand, while the enzyme serves as the motor that advances the strand through the pore. The process can also run in reverse, so that the same strand is fed back and forth through the nanopore. "We can improve the accuracy of reads on single strands by rereading it several times," Akeson said.</p>
<p>The nucleotides are the "letters" of the DNA code, chemical subunits denoted by their initials (A, T, C, and G). Importantly, the nanopore device has the potential to yield not only the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA strand, but also information about modifications of individual nucleotides. Geneticists have discovered that chemical changes to nucleotides--known as "epigenetic modifications"--can control gene expression. Cells use epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation to turn genes on or off.</p>
<p>Whereas other sequencing technologies involve making copies of the DNA strands extracted from cells, the nanopore device can analyze DNA molecules directly from the nucleus of a single cell. "Because we read DNA directly out of the nucleus, we can observe epigenetic modifications and DNA damage," Akeson said. "There is a lot of work to be done in this area, and this technology could have an important impact on medical research related to cancer and regenerative medicine."</p>
<p>In addition to Akeson, key people involved in the new project include co-investigator Kevin Karplus, professor of biomolecular engineering; research professor David Deamer; and project scientists Kate Lieberman and Hugh Olsen.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/nanopore-sequencer.html</url><title>New DNA sequencer uses nanopore concepts pioneered at UCSC</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/akeson-uncommon-people.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/akeson-uncommon-people.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>akeson-uncommon-people.jpg</name><display-name>akeson-uncommon-people.jpg</display-name><file-size>12513</file-size><width>216</width><height>98</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>MARK AKESON</title><description>Biomolecular engineering professor will receive $2.29 million from the National Human Genome Research Institute to support novel DNA sequencing technology.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ad8113dd807270461ae4b3b8e025ab33"><name>pan-cancer-study</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Cancer study reveals powerful new system for classifying tumors</title><summary>One in ten cancer patients would be classified differently using a new classification system based on molecular subtypes.</summary><keywords>Josh Stuart, Joshua Stuart, Pan-Cancer Initiative, TCGA, Cancer Genome Atlas, cancer genomics, Genomics Institute</keywords><start-date>1407427200000</start-date><display-name>Cancer study reveals powerful new system for classifying tumors</display-name><path>/2014/08/pan-cancer-study</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/pan-cancer-study</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1407365223296</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1408050634225</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/pancan-graphic-crop-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/pancan-graphic-crop-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pancan-graphic-crop-375.jpg</name><display-name>pancan-graphic-crop-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>98993</file-size><width>375</width><height>322</height></image><image-alt>diagram of cancer types included in study</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/pancan-graphic-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/pancan-graphic-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pancan-graphic-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>pancan-graphic-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>32280</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>diagram of cancer types included in study</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>This diagram illustrates how tumors with different tissues of origin were reclassified on the basis of molecular analyses. <a href="images/pancan-graphic-900.jpg">View larger image</a>.

According to a new study, however, one in ten cancer patients would be classified differently using a new classification system based on molecular subtypes instead of the current tissue-of-origin system. This reclassification could lead to different therapeutic options for those patients, scientists reported in a paper published August 7 in <i>Cell</i>.</p>
<p>"It's only ten percent that were classified differently, but it matters a lot if you're one of those patients," said senior author Josh Stuart, a professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Stuart helped organize the study as part of the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/09/pan-cancer-studies.html">Pan-Cancer Initiative</a> of the <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a> project. A large team of researchers from multiple institutions performed a comprehensive analysis of molecular data from thousands of patients representing 12 different types of cancer. This was the most comprehensive and diverse collection of tumors ever analyzed by systematic genomic methods. Each tumor type was characterized using six different "platforms" or methods of molecular analysis--mostly genomic platforms such as DNA and RNA sequencing, plus a protein expression analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster analysis</strong></p>
<p>The research team used statistical analyses of the molecular data to divide the tumors into groups or "clusters," first analyzing the data from each platform separately and then combining them in an integrated cross-platform analysis developed by co-first author Katherine Hoadley of the University of North Carolina. All six platforms as well as the integrated analysis converged on the same divisions of the cancers into 11 major subtypes. Five of those subtypes were nearly identical to their tissue-of-origin counterparts. But some tissue-of-origin categories split into several different molecular subtypes, and some subtypes encompass tumors with several different tissues of origin.</p>
<p>Bladder cancer was a particularly interesting group, because it split into seven different clusters, with most samples falling into one of three subtypes. One subtype was bladder cancer only, but some bladder cancers clustered with lung adenocarcinomas, and others with a subtype called 'squamous-like' that includes some lung cancers, some head-and-neck cancers, and some bladder cancers.</p>
<p>"If you look at survival rates, the bladder cancers that clustered with other tumor types had a worse prognosis. So this is not just an academic exercise," Stuart said.</p>
<p>Other findings from the study reconfirmed cancer subtypes that were already recognized, such as the different subtypes of breast cancer based on well-characterized biomarkers. The findings provide a more refined, quantitative picture of the differences between breast cancer subtypes, Stuart said. For example, the results reinforce the idea that 'basal-like' breast cancers are a unique tumor type. "Basal-like breast cancers are as different from luminal breast cancers as they are from lung cancers," he said.</p>
<p>The fact that all six platforms for molecular analysis identified the same set of subtypes, both individually and in multi-platform analyses, is an important result, Stuart noted. Not only does it give the researchers confidence in the subtypes they identified, it also means that different kinds of data can be used to classify a tumor.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Telltale signatures</strong></p>
<p>"We can now say what the telltale signatures of the subtypes are, so you can classify a patient's tumor just based on the gene expression data, or just based on mutation data, if that's what you have," Stuart said. "Having a molecular map like this could help get a patient into the right clinical trial."</p>
<p>Although follow-up studies are needed to validate the findings, this new analysis lays the groundwork for classifying tumors into molecularly defined subtypes. The new classification scheme could be used to enroll patients in clinical trials and could lead to different treatment options based on molecular subtypes.</p>
<p>According to Stuart, the percentage of tumors that are reclassified based on molecular signatures is likely to grow as more samples and tumor types are included in the analysis (the next major Pan-Cancer analysis will include 21 tumor types). Coauthor Christopher Benz, an oncologist at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and UC San Francisco, noted that the 10 percent reclassification rate in the current study is likely an underestimate due to the unequal representation of different tumors. "If our study had included as many bladder cancers as breast cancers, for example, we would have reclassified 30 percent," Benz said.</p>
<p>The researchers reported that each molecular subtype may reflect tumors arising from distinct cell types. For example, the data showed a marked difference between cancers of epithelial and non-epithelial origins. "We think the subtypes reflect primarily the cell of origin. Another factor is the nature of the genomic lesion, and third is the microenvironment of the cell and how surrounding cells influence it," Stuart said. "We are disentangling the signals from these different factors so we can gauge each one for its prognostic power."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Data coordinator</strong></p>
<p>The study involved an enormous amount of molecular and clinical data, which was managed by data coordinator Kyle Ellrott, a software developer in Stuart's lab at UC Santa Cruz. The data sets and results have been made available to other researchers through the Synapse web site (<a href="http://www.synapse.org">www.synapse.org</a>). Stuart worked with the bioinformatics company Sage Bionetworks to create Synapse as a data repository for the Pan-Cancer Initiative.</p>
<p>"It's a huge amount of information, and all the data is available as programmable data sets that other researchers can use to do further analysis," Stuart said. "The scale of this project is hard to imagine. All of the data that the TCGA project has been churning out got funneled into this paper, and it's giving us an unbiased look at what the data have to tell us about cancer."</p>
<p>The work was performed as part of the UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center for the TCGA project led by Stuart, Benz, and David Haussler, director of the UC Santa Cruz <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu">Genomics Institute</a>. The corresponding authors of the paper are Stuart, Benz, and Charles Perou of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The co-first authors are Katherine Hoadley of UNC; Christina Yau of the Buck Institute; Denise Wolf of UCSF; and Andrew Cherniack of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Stuart's graduate students Sam Ng and Vladislav Uzunangelov also made significant contributions to the analysis.</p>
<p>This research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health. The TCGA project is led by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute. TCGA is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. The TCGA Pan-Cancer Initiative was launched in October 2012 at a meeting in Santa Cruz, California.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ada16b3a807270461ae4b3b8752b68df"><name>science-teaching-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz Cal Teach alum wins Knowles science teaching fellowship</title><summary>The Knowles Science Teaching Foundation has awarded a 2014 teaching fellowship to alumna Brenda Minjares.</summary><keywords>Brenda Minjares, Gretchen Andreasen, Cal Teach</keywords><start-date>1407308400000</start-date><display-name>Cal Teach alum wins Knowles science teaching fellowship</display-name><path>/2014/08/science-teaching-fellowship</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/science-teaching-fellowship</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1407367342833</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1407367485318</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/brenda-minjares-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/brenda-minjares-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brenda-minjares-250.jpg</name><display-name>brenda-minjares-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>61438</file-size><width>250</width><height>316</height></image><image-alt>Brenda Minjares</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/brenda-minjares-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/brenda-minjares-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>brenda-minjares-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>brenda-minjares-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30317</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Brenda Minjares</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Brenda Minjares</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The Knowles Science Teaching Foundation (KSTF) has awarded a 2014 teaching fellowship to UC Santa Cruz alumna Brenda Minjares. Minjares earned her B.S. in physics education from UCSC in 2012. She participated in UCSC's Cal Teach Program, which provides internships, coursework, and scholarships for prospective math and science teachers.</p>
<p>Minjares said she is committed to teaching science to high school students in the United States. In addition to a B.S. in physics education from UCSC, she earned her M.A. in teaching at UC Irvine. This fall, Minjares will begin her first year of teaching at Escondido High School, located in Escondido, Calif.</p>
<p>"I am very excited about this opportunity because it entails leading the team as we try to build our physics program over the coming years," Minjares said. "Without the support of Cal Teach I wouldn't have made it to where I am today."</p>
<p>One of her mentors at UCSC, Cal Teach director Gretchen Andreasen, said, "Outcomes like Brenda's are what make working with Cal Teach so much fun. I am so happy we could help Brenda achieve her goals <i>and</i> address the shortage of physics teachers."</p>
<p>Minjares is one of 32 exceptionally talented, early career science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers to be awarded a 2014 KSTF Teaching Fellowship.

"Our donors believe in the work that's taking place at UC Santa Cruz, and their generosity is making a lasting difference for the campus, our students, and faculty." <br/><br/>Alumni and other friends of the campus contributed $19.2 million, 38 percent of the total; foundations added $21 million, 42 percent; and corporations gave $8.7 million, 18 percent.<br/><br/>Notable gifts will support UC Santa Cruz's leadership in sustainable agriculture, environmental studies, and experiential learning. An anonymous donor contributed $4 million to establish an endowment for the <a href="http://casfs.ucsc.edu/apprenticeship/index.html">Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture</a>. Founded in 1967, it is the longest-running, university-based organic-farmer-training program in the United States.<br/><br/>A <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/03/packard-foundation-gift.html">$2-million gift from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation</a> will help ensure that UC Santa Cruz continues as a leader in natural history and at the forefront of educating students to become environmental leaders. It will support hands-on learning and the Museum of Natural History Collections on campus. <br/><br/>A <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/julie-packard-gift.html">$1-million gift from Julie Packard</a>, a UC Santa Cruz alumna, will support programs that help underrepresented minority students excel in the sciences and mathematics.<br/><br/>Approximately $7 million of the $50 million in gifts recorded for fiscal year 2013-2014 are bequests made in donors' estate plans. A $1-million pledge bequest from alums Gary Sloan and Barbara Komas will create two endowments at Crown College; one to provide support for students and faculty in undergraduate research and another for scholarships for Crown students from their freshman through senior years.<br/><br/>Also included in the total is approximately $13 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation supporting construction of the <a href="http://www.tmt.org/">Thirty Meter Telescope</a> atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The funds are part of a nine-year, $200 million commitment the Moore Foundation made in 2007 to the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, who, with an international consortium, are building the most advanced and powerful optical telescope on Earth.<br/><br/>In fiscal 2014, The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz received 14,492 gifts from 10,893 donors, including 3,539 alumni who contributed 4,708 gifts.</p>

We have made some recent changes to the program by adding an additional core course entitled &#8220;Historical Overview: Power, Privilege and Oppression&#8221;. For new registrants who are pursuing a certificate, the Program requires a completion of nine courses (seven core courses and two electives) that provide a valuable professional development opportunity at <b><i>no cost</i></b> to employees or employee units. Participants who complete all seven core courses and two elective program courses within two years qualify to receive a certificate of completion. Individual courses are also open to those who are not pursuing a certificate; individuals have the option to take courses based on their own interest.<br/> <br/> The Program is designed to offer participants an in-depth examination of diversity and differences in order to gain a greater understanding of how we can and why we should work together to build a stronger and more inclusive UC Santa Cruz community. The courses range from two to three hours and will be taught by various internal and external instructors in different formats. The core courses are offered twice during the academic year while the elective courses are offered once. Since the program began in 2010, we have had 170 graduates! We continue to receive positive feedback about this program which strives to promote diversity and inclusion on campus.<br/> <br/> Please mark your calendars:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b> Registration begins September 8, 2014</b></span>. Please plan accordingly if you are out of the office because classes fill up quickly (class size is limited). Our courses for this academic year officially begin on October 9, 2014.

In a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl502400x">paper</a> published July 9 in <i>Nano Letters</i>, the researchers reported using the device to distinguish viruses from similarly-sized nanoparticles with 100 percent fidelity.</p>
<p>Combining electrical and optical measurements on a single chip provides more information than either technique alone, said corresponding author Holger Schmidt, the Kapany Professor of Optoelectronics in the Baskin School of Engineering and director of the <a href="http://cfno.soe.ucsc.edu/">W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics</a> at UC Santa Cruz. Graduate student Shuo Liu is first author of the paper.</p>
<p>The new chip builds on previous work by Schmidt's lab and his collaborators at Brigham Young University to develop optofluidic chip technology for optical analysis of single molecules as they pass through a tiny fluid-filled channel on the chip. The new device incorporates a nanopore that serves two functions: it acts as a "smart gate" to control the delivery of individual molecules or nanoparticles into the channel for optical analysis; and it allows electrical measurements as a particle passes through the nanopore.</p>
<p>"The nanopore delivers a single molecule into the fluidic channel, where it is then available for optical measurements. This is a useful research tool for doing single-molecule studies," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Biological nanopores, a technology developed by coauthor David Deamer and others at UC Santa Cruz, can be used to analyze a DNA strand as it passes through a tiny pore embedded in a membrane. Researchers apply voltage across the membrane, which pulls the negatively charged DNA through the pore. Current fluctuations as the DNA moves through the pore provide electrical signals that can be decoded to determine the genetic sequence of the strand.</p>
<p>With the new device, researchers are able to gather electrical measurements on a nanoparticle as it moves through a pore in a solid membrane, and then measure the optical signals when the particle encounters a beam of light in the channel. By correlating the strength of the current decrease as a particle moves through the pore, the intensity of the optical signal, and the time of each measurement, the researchers are able to discriminate among particles with different sizes and optical properties and to determine the flow speed of particles through the channel.</p>
<p>The chip can also be used to differentiate particles of similar size but different composition. In one experiment, the researchers combined influenza viruses with nanobeads of a similar diameter and placed the mixture above the nanopore. The virus was labeled with a red fluorescent tag and the beads were labeled with a blue tag. The researchers correlated the electrical signal with the fluorescent wavelength and the time of each measurement. They found that the blue nanobeads traveled faster through the channel than red influenza virus, perhaps because of a difference in surface charge or mass. Besides identifying pathogens in a mixture, the researchers can also count the number of virus particles.</p>
<p>"This could be used as an analytical device to do reliable counts of virus particles in a sample," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Currently, Schmidt's group is working on methods to add optical trapping to the device. This would allow a molecule in the channel to be held in one place, investigated, and released, with the potential to analyze hundreds of molecules in an hour. "Having this all on one chip would make single-molecule measurements much easier and more convenient," Schmidt said.</p>
<p>In addition to Liu and Schmidt, the coauthors include UCSC graduate student Joshua Parks, and Yue Zhao and Aaron Hawkins at Brigham Young University. This work was supported by the Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics and grants from the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d1b2075d807270461ae4b3b854a9c07f"><name>coastal-biology-building</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Construction of new Coastal Biology building to begin in November</title><summary>Construction will begin in November on a new building near Long Marine Laboratory at the UC Santa Cruz coastal science campus.</summary><keywords>Coastal Biology, Coastal Biology building, Coastal Science Campus, Wells Fargo, Pete Raimondi, Gary Griggs</keywords><start-date>1408037400000</start-date><display-name>Construction of new Coastal Biology building to begin in November</display-name><path>/2014/08/coastal-biology-building</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/coastal-biology-building</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1407972411185</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1408405933011</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Construction</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/view1-390.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/view1-390.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>view1-390.jpg</name><display-name>view1-390.jpg</display-name><file-size>65179</file-size><width>390</width><height>216</height></image><image-alt>architectural rendering of Coastal Biology building</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/view1-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/view1-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>view1-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>view1-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26663</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>architectural rendering of Coastal Biology building</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/view2-390.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/view2-390.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>view2-390.jpg</name><display-name>view2-390.jpg</display-name><file-size>64087</file-size><width>390</width><height>209</height></image><image-alt>architectural rendering of Coastal Biology building</image-alt><image-caption><p>Architectural renderings show two views of the Coastal Biology building. (Image credit: EHDD)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Construction will begin in November on a new building near Long Marine Laboratory at the UC Santa Cruz coastal science campus. The Coastal Biology building will support research and teaching on coastal conservation, ecology, habitat restoration, climate change impacts, and policy.</p>
<p>Faculty and researchers in UCSC's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology will come together in the Coastal Biology building after many years in which some were based on the main campus and others at Long Marine Laboratory. The new building will relieve space constraints and allow for the expansion of programs in coastal sustainability and conservation biology.</p>
<p>"Reuniting the department will be a huge plus for our faculty and students," said department chair Peter Raimondi, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. "The facilities themselves will be great, with exceptional research labs, a teaching lab with freshwater and seawater, greenhouses, and areas where students can hang out. It will be a great place to work and learn."</p>
<p><strong>Coastal Science Campus</strong></p>
<p>Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, said the Coastal Biology building will enable more effective interactions not only among faculty and students within the department, but also with other groups based at the Coastal Science Campus. These include scientists with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) and California Department of Fish and Wildlife, as well as conservation organizations like the Nature Conservancy.</p>
<p>"We have a growing community of scientists studying issues related to coastal sustainability, conservation, and ocean health, and these are the issues that motivate a lot of our students as well," Griggs said. "We're working on problems at the ocean's edge, on both the terrestrial side and the marine side of the coastal zone."</p>
<p>The Coastal Biology building is the first major construction project to be carried out under UCSC's Coastal Long Range Development Plan (CLRDP), which was approved by the California Coastal Commission in 2009. The CLRDP is a comprehensive land-use plan for possible future development at the Coastal Science Campus, providing clustered development zones for new facilities while setting aside 72 acres of the 100-acre site for environmental restoration and preservation of sensitive habitat.</p>
<p>"Only about 25 percent of the site will ever be built on, so most of it will remain open space and will be protected and restored as part of Younger Lagoon Reserve," Griggs said. "The ongoing habitat restoration work provides great opportunities for research and hands-on teaching activities."</p>
<p><strong>Natural Reserve</strong></p>
<p>Part of the UC Natural Reserve System, Younger Lagoon Reserve was established in 1986 as a 25-acre reserve of lagoon, beach, marsh, and coastal bluff habitat adjacent to Long Marine Laboratory. In 1999, UCSC purchased from Wells Fargo Bank approximately 55 acres of the upland terrace next to Long Marine Lab, of which 47 acres have been added to Younger Lagoon Reserve. The developable area where the Coastal Biology building will be constructed, which may include additional buildings in the future, has been named the Wells Fargo Coastal Science Research Center.</p>
<p>The new building will be just north of the NOAA Fisheries lab building, with a new parking lot adjoining the existing NOAA parking lot. The construction project will also include a number of major infrastructure upgrades called for in the CLRDP, including paths for walking and biking, overlooks with interpretive panels, improvements to underground utilities, and a small public access parking lot.</p>
<p>The Coastal Biology building was designed by the San Francisco architecture firm EHDD. The main building is 40,000 gross square feet on two floors, with offices and laboratories for faculty and researchers, a 125-seat seminar room, a core seawater lab for research and teaching, and meeting spaces and conference rooms. An ancillary complex of greenhouses for research and habitat restoration work will be located across McAllister Way from the main building.</p>
<p>Construction work is scheduled to begin in early November 2014 and is expected to be completed by fall 2016.

Locations for this work include the Oakes Road, Heller Drive between College Eight and Meyer Drive, and Hagar Drive between McLaughlin and the Wellness Center. </span></big></span></big></p>
<p><big><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><big><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">These construction activities will be very noisy, involving large earth-moving equipment which will grind the existing roadway in place to form the subgrade for the new road. This in situ process, known as "Full Depth Reclamation," is considered a more sustainable roadway rehabilitation technique where existing material is reused on-site, reducing the number of trucks off-hauling material from campus. </span></big></span></big></p>
<p><big><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><big><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Two-way traffic control will be in place for the duration of the project. Drivers and transit riders should expect up to three-to-five minute delays in both directions while construction is underway. </span></big></span></big></p>
<p><big><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><big><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Cyclists accessing facilities along the construction routes should use extra caution when traversing the construction corridor.

Nevertheless, her parents had their daughter fitted for glasses and encouraged her to join her peers in the classroom in their hometown in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Morales&#8217;s vision deteriorated as she grew up, and she was legally blind by her mid-teens. She found it hard to keep up in class, and she almost dropped out of school. But she stuck with it, using electronic magnifiers to display enlarged text on a television screen. Her mother and her high school would enlarge reading material by photocopying it. Screen magnifier software helped her use a computer. Determined to complete her schoolwork, Morales graduated ninth in her high school class. She continued to work hard in college at the University of Puerto Rico, R&#237;o Piedras, and traveled to the continental United States three times for summer research projects.</p>
<p>Now, as a graduate student in computer science at UC Santa Cruz, Morales is working to fulfill her goal of helping others with disabilities use technology to advance socially, academically, and professionally. It's a goal she began to pursue as an undergraduate, choosing computer science as a major so she could work on electronic assistive technology like the magnifiers she used during high school.</p>
<p><strong>Summer research programs</strong></p>
<p>A mentor at the university encouraged Morales to apply for summer research programs. In the summer of 2009, she took her first trip to the continental United States for a research project in computational mathematics at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, CA. Morales said she was nervous about coming to California, but when she got to Berkeley she found that she loved the research.</p>
<p>The next school year, when Morales was looking for other summer research projects, she learned about the <a href="http://isis.soe.ucsc.edu">Interactive Systems for Individuals with Special Needs</a> (ISIS) lab at UC Santa Cruz (then called the Assistive Technology Lab). Led by Sri Kurniawan, associate professor of computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, the group works to help people with special needs maintain a high quality of life through technology. The research would be an opportunity for Morales to apply her skills in computer programming to her original interest in assistive technology.</p>
<p>Morales came to UCSC in the summer of 2010 and worked on a mobile phone game that motivates teenagers to exercise. One aspect of the project she particularly liked was that people who would use the technology participated in its design. The key to this process is working with users from the beginning of a project, interviewing them about how they use a particular technology, and gathering their thoughts on how it could be improved. Researchers use that information to design a prototype program, which is tested with users and improved based on their feedback.</p>
<p>In March 2011, Kurniawan received a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award to develop a software program to help blind people format documents such as resum&#233;s using a word processing program. Morales secured her own funding to return to UCSC that summer to work on the project, which she is continuing to focus on as a graduate student. Morales has interviewed and surveyed blind people to learn about their concerns around document formatting. Some were worried that submitting an atypically formatted document would make them appear sloppy, careless, or unprofessional to sighted readers. Others were more dismissive, considering formatting something that only benefits sighted people.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions challenged</strong></p>
<p>Information from the interviews and surveys also challenged certain assumptions that Morales had unknowingly brought to the project. &#8220;I thought blind people knew how to format documents, and we just needed to make a tool to help,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But they want to know how and why sighted people use formatting functions.&#8221; So now her formatting program has an additional objective to be a learning tool for the users.</p>
<p>Morales receives support from a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the UC Santa Cruz Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship. Her immediate goal is to complete the requirements to advance to doctoral candidacy so she can focus on her dissertation. But Morales said it can be a challenge for her to focus her attention on one project, because other projects in the group look like such good opportunities to learn new skills. Many of the students in the ISIS lab work on pro bono projects commissioned by non-profit or educational organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lourdes is one of the students who always jumps when I need new volunteers,&#8221; Kurniawan said.</p>
<p>Morales volunteered for a project collaborating with <a href="http://www.imaginecolorado.org">Imagine!</a>, a non-profit group in Colorado that works with people with cognitive and developmental disabilities. The group asked the ISIS lab to develop several mobile applications to help their clients with basic tasks like number counting, identifying colors, reading a clock, and identifying public symbols. Existing applications like this are often developed for children. Animations and loud noises in these apps keep children&#8217;s attention, but they can be distracting or juvenile to people with cognitive disabilities.</p>
<p>Morales has also worked on a game to help stroke survivors learn math, narrated a game to help kids perform physical therapy exercises after cleft palate surgery, and performed user tests for a vibrating belt developed at Toyota that could help blind people navigate.</p>
<p>Morales said she enjoys programming and likes to use her skills to help people. In some cases, the benefits of her work may extend well beyond her target users. &#8220;Sometimes when you develop things to be more accessible, they become a new standard because they&#8217;re easier to use,&#8221; she said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ea31148e807270461ae4b3b8d8d7984b"><name>breast-cancer-research</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Breast Cancer Breakthrough Award funds search for new treatments</title><summary>Cancer researcher Seth Rubin is working toward the development of a new class of drugs for treating breast cancer.</summary><keywords>Seth Rubin, breast cancer, SCCBG</keywords><start-date>1408345200000</start-date><display-name>Breast Cancer Breakthrough Award</display-name><path>/2014/08/breast-cancer-research</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/breast-cancer-research</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1408383390813</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1410203622096</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/seth-rubin-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/seth-rubin-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seth-rubin-350.jpg</name><display-name>seth-rubin-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>83087</file-size><width>350</width><height>417</height></image><image-alt>Seth Rubin</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/seth-rubin-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/seth-rubin-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>seth-rubin-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>seth-rubin-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24740</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Seth Rubin</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Seth Rubin (Photo by C.

The grant is a Breast Cancer Research Program Breakthrough Award from the congressionally directed medical research programs of the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Rubin, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, will use the grant to build on his recent discoveries regarding a key tumor suppressor protein that is inactivated in most breast cancer cells. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) helps regulate the cycle of cell growth and division, putting the brakes on cell proliferation when it is active. In normal cells, Rb coordinates cellular growth signals, turning on and off to ensure that cells divide at the right time. Genetic changes in cancer cells disrupt this regulatory pathway and allow cells to multiply out of control.</p>
<p>Rubin's research has revealed important details of the molecular mechanisms involved in turning Rb on and off. These findings suggested the possibility of a new class of therapeutic molecules that target the retinoblastoma protein directly. Most attempts to target the retinoblastoma pathway with drugs have focused on blocking the action of other proteins that inactivate Rb.</p>
<p>"A common analogy is to think of cancer cells as being like a car with a jammed accelerator and broken brakes, so the cells can't stop proliferating. Most drugs target the jammed accelerator and knock down proteins that are too active. We want to target the broken brakes and restore the tumor suppressor activity," Rubin said.</p>
<p>This novel approach promises to have fewer toxic side effects and be less vulnerable to acquired drug resistance than other therapies. Traditional drug discovery efforts focus on finding molecules that block the activity of a target protein. Little attention has been given to using small molecules to activate a tumor suppressor directly. Rubin's research could open up a whole new class of targets for drug discovery efforts.</p>
<p>Rubin's lab developed an assay for Rb activity to use in large-scale testing procedures for identifying small molecules that can stabilize the activated form of Rb. Identifying molecules with the desired activity is the first step in the drug development process and requires screening huge numbers of compounds.</p>
<p>Rubin used a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/08/sccbg.html">small grant from the Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group</a> (SCCBG), a local charity supporting cancer research and patient care, to test his group's Rb assay in a pilot study conducted at the UCSC <a href="https://cscenter.pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Chemical Screening Center</a>. Their pilot screen of about 20,000 compounds showed that the assay works well in a high-throughput screening procedure.</p>
<p>The new grant will fund a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.sanfordburnham.org/technology/centers/cpccg/Pages/Home.aspx">Conrad Prebys Center for Chemical Genomics</a> at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in La Jolla. The center will use Rubin's assay to screen a library of about 320,000 compounds. Follow-up studies to further evaluate compounds identified in the large-scale screening tests will be carried out by Rubin's lab in collaboration with Julien Sage, a cancer biologist at the Stanford School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Rubin's lab will also investigate the molecular details of how the lead compounds interact with the retinoblastoma protein. These studies will provide a foundation for future work needed to develop promising compounds into medically useful drugs for breast cancer therapy.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/08/3967.html</url><title>Protein structure reveals how tumor suppressor turns on and off</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/14973306325_c9c8151f0c_k.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/14973306325_c9c8151f0c_k.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>14973306325_c9c8151f0c_k.jpg</name><display-name>14973306325_c9c8151f0c_k.jpg</display-name><file-size>18584</file-size><width>295</width><height>128</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Seth Rubin</thumb-alt><title>SETH RUBIN</title><description>Cancer researcher will use a $350,000 grant to continue the development of a new class of drugs for treating breast cancer. </description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ef619f9b807270461ae4b3b845bc102c"><name>arwu-rankings</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz moves up in Shanghai ranking of world universities </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is ranked 93 among the world's best universities and in the top 50 in the U.S., according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) published by a Shanghai education-consulting firm.  </summary><start-date>1408473600000</start-date><display-name>Academic Ranking of World Universities</display-name><path>/2014/08/arwu-rankings</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/arwu-rankings</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1408470458224</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1408747286631</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/arwu-300.png</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/arwu-300.png</link><site>news</site><name>arwu-300.png</name><display-name>arwu-300.png</display-name><file-size>30135</file-size><width>300</width><height>117</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/arwu-80.png</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/arwu-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>arwu-80.png</name><display-name>arwu-80.png</display-name><file-size>8497</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is ranked 93 among the world's best universities and in the top 50 in the U.S., according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) published by a Shanghai education-consulting firm. &#160;<br/><br/>It's a move up at least eight places for the campus that last year was listed in the 101-150 category. The annual study by the Shanghai Ranking Consultancy, a firm spun off five years ago from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, looks at more that 1,200 universities in the world and publishes data on what it deems are the top 500.<br/><br/>The ranking system uses six criteria, including the number of alumni and staff winning Nobel Prizes and Fields Medals, number of highly cited researchers selected by Thomson Reuters, number of articles published in the journals of Nature and Science, and the number of articles indexed in Science Citation Index &#8211; Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index. It's then adjusted based on the number of faculty an institution has. <br/><br/>In subject areas, UC Santa Cruz ranked 33 in the world for physics. In broad academic areas the campus ranked in the 51-75 range for natural sciences and mathematics; also 51-75 for life and agricultural sciences; and 151-200 for social sciences. <br/><br/>The ARWU was first published in 2003 by the Center for World-Class Universities, Graduate School of Education of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Initially, it was launched in an effort to see how Chinese universities compared with others around the world. <br/><br/>Nine University of California campuses placed in the top 150.

They included UC Santa Cruz students doing research in a broad range of disciplines, from bioengineering and physics to linguistics and psychology. The event also included students from other universities around the country who came to UC Santa Cruz for summer experiences in undergraduate research.</p>
<p>Many of the students who presented their work are participants in various programs at UCSC that support underrepresented students in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), said Malika Bell, director of <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">STEM diversity programs</a> at UCSC, whose office organized the symposium. The STEM diversity programs offer students financial support, mentorships, and research training.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/imsd/">Initiative for Maximizing Student Development</a> (IMSD), for example, supported biology students Kendy Huang and Joanna Perez, who used molecular cloning techniques for their research on RNA binding proteins in the lab of Grant Hartzog, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology.</p>
<p>Erica Bufanda, an astrophysics student who presented her research on active galactic nuclei in galaxy clusters, was one of ten Julie Packard Summer Scholars at the symposium. These summer research scholarships for undergraduates are among the student programs supported by a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/julie-packard-gift.html">recent gift</a> from alumna Julie Packard to establish the Dean's Fund for Diversity in the Sciences.</p>
<p>Several programs bring students from regional community colleges to UC Santa Cruz for summer research internships. Rex Niduaza, a participant in the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/ucleads/">UC LEADS</a> program, will be transferring this fall from Hartnell College to UCSC. He and fellow Hartnell student Annie O presented their work at UCSC this summer on an adaptive optics microscopy project led by Joel Kubby, professor of electrical engineering. "Before this summer, I had never even heard of adaptive optics or super-resolution, so I've learned a lot," Niduaza said.</p>
<p>Other students traveled thousands of miles to spend the summer doing research at UC Santa Cruz. Hannah Becton, an engineering student at the University of South Alabama, took part in the <a href="https://surf-it.soe.ucsc.edu/">Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Information Technology</a> (SURF-IT), one of two Research Experience for Undergraduates programs at UCSC sponsored by the National Science Foundation. She spent the summer working with computer engineer Gabe Elkaim on technology for animal tracking collars that aims to supplement the collar's battery power by capturing energy generated by an animal's movements.</p>
<p>This was the fifth annual Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium, and Bell said participation has grown every year. This year's event featured nearly 100 student projects.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f4a2c885807270461ae4b3b8b2269eb9"><name>science-notes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Science Notes 2014' now available online</title><summary>The weird and wondrous feeding habits of moray eels are among the featured stories in the Science Communication Program's magazine.</summary><keywords>Science Notes, Science Communication Program</keywords><start-date>1408518000000</start-date><display-name>'Science Notes 2014' now available online</display-name><path>/2014/08/science-notes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/science-notes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1408558614558</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1408558805361</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Science Communication Program</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Publications</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Rob Irion</name><title></title><phone/><email>irion@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/logo-380.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/logo-380.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>logo-380.jpg</name><display-name>logo-380.jpg</display-name><file-size>35604</file-size><width>380</width><height>68</height></image><image-alt>Science Notes logo</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/cover-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/cover-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cover-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25668</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>image of shark from magazine cover</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/cover-380.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/cover-380.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cover-380.jpg</name><display-name>cover-380.jpg</display-name><file-size>62658</file-size><width>380</width><height>167</height></image><image-alt>Science Notes cover image</image-alt><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Ingesting hookworms to treat autoimmune disease. Why Japan's undersea earthquake fault was so devastating. The connection between migraine in adults and stomach pains in babies. Those are some of the featured tales in <i><a href="http://sciencenotes.ucsc.edu/2014/">Science Notes 2014</a></i>, the annual magazine published by the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication Program.</p>
<p>This year's issue includes a thorough analysis of why Santa Cruz just can't seem to deal with its serious drought. There's a dive into the weird and wondrous feeding habits of moray eels; a vivid look at how car videos revealed just how a space rock blew up over Chelyabinsk, Russia; and a story about Mexican ants that may make you ponder the origins of your morning coffee.</p>
<p>You'll also enter the obsessive realm of sour beer brewers (and drinkers) in the Bay Area, and you'll learn the pros and cons of being exquisitely attuned to your own heartbeat. Finally, why doesn't California's racing industry do more to prevent horse deaths at the track? You'll find out in <i>Science Notes</i>.</p>
<p>As always, the magazine brims with original artwork from the talented artists at the Science Illustration Program at CSU Monterey Bay. This year's magazine also features infographics produced by the writers to display data-rich elements of their stories. You'll see those embedded in their pieces, along with four-minute podcasts, many original photos, and a couple of videos as well.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://sciencenotes.ucsc.edu/2014/</url><title>Science Notes 2014</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://scicom.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Science Communication Program</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f4c722c3807270461ae4b3b8dc719bda"><name>mascharak-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Pradip Mascharak wins Gandhi medal for non-resident Indians</title><summary>Chemistry professor Pradip Mascharak will be honored by the Non-Resident Indians Welfare Society of India.</summary><keywords>Pradip Mascharak</keywords><start-date>1408518000000</start-date><display-name>Pradip Mascharak wins Gandhi medal for non-resident Indians</display-name><path>/2014/08/mascharak-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/mascharak-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1408560997017</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1408647085905</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/mascharak.200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/mascharak.200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mascharak.200.jpg</name><display-name>mascharak.200.jpg</display-name><file-size>49883</file-size><width>200</width><height>237</height></image><image-alt>Pradip Mascharak</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/mascharak-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/mascharak-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>mascharak-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>mascharak-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>24967</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Pradip Mascharak</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Pradip Mascharak</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Pradip Mascharak, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, has been awarded the Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Samman award by the Non-Resident Indians (NRI) Welfare Society of India.</p>
<p>Mascharak is one of 30 Indians worldwide who will receive the honor on October 9 at the House of Lords in London. The medal recognizes outstanding services and achievements by Indians in the international arena.</p>
<p>Mascharak's research focuses on the structure and function of enzymes, green chemistry, and designing drugs for cancer and inflammation. His group is investigating the use of metal nitrosyls as agents in photodynamic therapy, in which light triggers the release of therapeutic doses of nitric oxide at targeted sites, such as localized cancers. An Alfred Sloan fellow and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Mascharak joined the UCSC faculty in 1984.</p>
<p>The NRI Welfare Society was founded with the objective of strengthening ties between India and non-resident Indians.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f4ef93bf807270461ae4b3b8e79054d0"><name>safety-advisory-raccoons</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Safety advisory: Raccoon bites reported</title><summary>If you see a raccoon, please take steps to avoid it.

Some behaviors of raccoons with rabies are:
<ul>
<li>Staggering gait</li>
<li>Seemingly oblivious to noise or nearby movement</li>
<li>Erratic wandering</li>
<li>Discharge from eyes or mouth</li>
<li>Wet and matted hair on face</li>
<li>Repeated high-pitch vocalization</li>
<li>Self-mutilation</li>
</ul>

<p>The resolution calls for the humane treatment of migrant children from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador who are coming to the U.S. border without their parents, fleeing from extreme violence, sexual assault, and political corruption to seek refuge in California.</p>
<p>&#8220;These children are not running <i>toward</i> the United States to gain some mythical American Dream,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;They are fleeing terrifying and proliferating violence, gangs, and poverty, and, I would like to underscore here, state-sponsored terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>"We need to honor our country's long commitment to welcoming refugees, immigrants, and victims seeking asylum, and be sure the children are provided with legal counsel, full due process, and love, rather than treating them as cattle or dangerous alien invaders," Frank added.</p>
<p>"It was chilling at the hearing to hear anti-immigrant protesters from Murietta attack the Assembly members personally, using arguments made up out of whole cloth."&#160;</p>
<p><b>Frank&#8217;s appearance before the State Assembly</b> comes almost exactly one year after she testified in Congress before the Human Rights Commission in the U.S. House of Representatives about human rights and U.S. policy in Honduras.</p>
<p>At that 2013 hearing in Washington D.C., Frank noted that Honduras had the highest homicide rate in the world with 86 murders per 100,000 residents. She observed that the country had experienced severe human rights challenges since the June 2009 military coup, and questioned U.S. policy supporting a corrupt and violent Honduran government. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p>At yesterday&#8217;s hearing, Frank told the State Assembly that continued U.S. government support of corruption and violence is a source of the current humanitarian crisis at the border.</p>
<p>"The U.S bears responsibility, in part, for this crisis,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;We continue to fund police and military forces in Honduras who are themselves committing terrifying human rights abuses, and not being prosecuted."&#160;</p>
<p>As Frank noted yesterday in the closing statement of her testimony in support of the resolution:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past month I have been horrified to watch our government pack terrorized little children onto planes and deport them to Honduras, into the arms of the very demons of their nightmares. But I am proud, today, as a Californian, to see my own state government stand up so forthrightly in support of those scared kids, and defend them against those who would commit further horrors against them, on either side of the border.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/08/Frank-Congress-hearing.html</url><title>UCSC’s

<p dir="ltr">On Wednesday, August 27, from 7 to 8 p.m., UC Santa Cruz will harness the power of social media during a &#8220;New Parent Chat,&#8221; a live Facebook event featuring a panel of three experts representing &#160;colleges, housing, and orientation, to talk about the upcoming &#160;academic year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Topics will include campus life, housing, dining, and any other subject that crosses the parents&#8217; minds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While parents who participate will enjoy the dynamic of a "real time" conversation, those who miss out can also benefit; the questions and comments will remain on Facebook, so parents can visit the page and still contribute to the dialogue even when the live portion of the discussion is over.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s how to join in if you are a new UC Santa Cruz parent:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Log in to Facebook on 8/27 at 7 p.m.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Go to&#160;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ucsantacruz">https://www.facebook.com/ucsantacruz</a></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Then, after &#8220;liking&#8221; the page, look for the post about the LIVE Facebook chat</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">At that point you can comment and ask questions at will, then sit back and watch the answers roll in from the expert panel, who will all be gathered in one room on campus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">"Nothing like this has been done before here at UC Santa Cruz for parents,&#8221; said Carolyn Golz, college administrative officer at Cowell and Stevenson colleges, who is part of the panel of experts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aside from Golz, the panel will also include UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s orientation director, Rosa Plaza; and Chris Banks, manager of marketing and communications&#160;for Colleges, Housing and Educational Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While this real-time Facebook chat for new parents is unprecedented on campus, staff already use social media to connect with students as well as parents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Two weeks ago a student tweeted about being nervous about orientation, and she was coming to the overnight program on campus," Golz said. "So I reached out to her and we talked. She told me she was having a great time at orientation."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I've sometimes seen students tweet that they are concerned about something; but when they get a response &#8212;'hey, how can I help?' &#8212;it leaves them feeling so much better. It is amazing to see how that kind of engagement can turn it around."</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also said that online discussions can be empowering for those who are less inclined to speak up. She includes herself in that category; "I find this approach very useful as an introvert," she said. "I am not going to introduce myself in a room with a bunch of strangers but I can do this online."</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal of the chat is to increase parent engagement and provide resources for parents using UC Santa Cruz social media. &#160;</p>

Their results, published August 31 in <i>Nature</i>, show that even stars that don't stay together in a cluster will share a chemical fingerprint with their siblings which can be used to trace them to the same birthplace.</p>
<p>"We can see that stars that are part of the same star cluster today are chemically identical, but we had no good reason to think that this would also be true of stars that were born together and then dispersed immediately rather than forming a long-lived cluster," said Mark Krumholz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Our sun and its siblings, for example, probably went their own ways within a few million years after they were born, Krumholz said. The new study suggests that astronomers could potentially find the sun's long-lost siblings even if they are now on the opposite side of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Krumholz and UC Santa Cruz graduate student Yi Feng used supercomputers to simulate two streams of interstellar gas coming together to form a cloud that, over the course of a few million years, collapses under its own gravity to make a cluster of stars. Studies of interstellar gas show much greater variation in chemical abundances than is seen among stars within the same open star cluster. To represent this variation, the researchers added "tracer dyes" to the two gas streams in the simulations. The results showed extreme turbulence as the two streams came together, and this turbulence effectively mixed together the tracer dyes.</p>
<p>"We put red dye in one stream and blue dye in the other, and by the time the cloud started to collapse and form stars, everything was purple. The resulting stars were purple as well," Krumholz said. "This explains why stars that are born together wind up having the same abundances: as the cloud that forms them is assembled, it gets thoroughly mixed. This was actually a bit of a surprise. I didn't expect the turbulence to be as violent as it was, so I didn't expect the mixing to be as rapid or efficient. I thought we'd get some blue stars and some red stars, instead of getting all purple stars."</p>
<p><strong>Fast mixing</strong></p>
<p>The simulations also showed that the mixing happens very fast, before much of the gas has turned into stars. This is encouraging for the prospects of finding the sun's siblings, because the distinguishing characteristic of stellar families that don't stay together is that they probably disperse before much of their parent cloud has been converted to stars. If the mixing didn't happen quickly enough, then the chemical uniformity of star clusters would be the exception rather than the rule. Instead, the simulations indicate that even clouds that don't turn much of their gas into stars produce stars with nearly identical chemical signatures.</p>
<p>"The idea of finding the siblings of the sun through chemical tagging is not new, but no one had any idea if it would work," Krumholz said. "The underlying problem was that we didn't really know why stars in clusters are chemically homogeneous, and so we couldn't make any sensible predictions about what would happen in the environment where the Sun formed, which must have been quite different from the environments that give rise to long-lived star clusters. This study puts the idea on much firmer footing and will hopefully spur greater efforts toward making use of this technique."</p>

<h3>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>It's meaningful fun. A volunteer can give back to UC Santa Cruz, experience the many social and intellectual rewards of being a Slug, and help to sustain the community life of the area where they live, all while having a good time. Quadruple benefit! What's not to like?</p>
<h3>Why types of things do you do as a Slug volunteer?</h3>
<p>Whatever is needed. I started by organizing a few happy hours in the Bay Area. To be clear, this was never a solo effort. The Alumni Association and other local volunteers were instrumental in putting things together. As a team, we ran the whole gamut of both planning (choosing venues and times, sending email announcements and follow-up replies) and implementing (setting up event spaces, welcoming guests, networking and mingling, giving out prizes, asking for ideas for future get-togethers, and, of course, keeping things fun).</p>
<p>Later, in Washington, DC, I helped with leadership visits. We were privileged to have a reception for Chancellor Blumenthal at the UCDC Center, and later a welcome event with the then-President of the Alumni Association, Amy Everitt. There were also fun baseball nights at Nationals Stadium and a couple other happy hours. All of these happened through the efforts of great teams of UCSC volunteers and staff.</p>
<p>Last year, I was delighted to be able to host a small tasting event at a Slug-owned hot sauce shop in Berkeley. I also assisted with on-site details and logistics for an Oakland A's tailgate party (which was led by a fantastic Bay Area volunteer), and this fall, I'll be helping with an alumni night at the Oakland Museum.</p>
<p>I've also had small roles in a couple of strategic planning efforts over the years with Merrill College, and with admissions outreach events.</p>
<h3>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</h3>
<p>The opportunity to meet so many interesting people. Alumni, students, faculty, staff, partners ... Slugs broadly and inclusively defined ... they're out there and they're marvelous. I've been humbled, many times, by what our global community members are doing. It's constant reinforcement in the belief in what UCSC is all about. (As to what we are all about, I remember Chancellor Blumenthal a few years ago describing UCSC as a unique part of a world-class educational and research institution, which I think captures the idea better than anything else I've heard.)</p>
<h3>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>I recommend it. The opportunities are pretty broad - there is a lot of room for new ideas and innovation for what's possible. The Alumni Association will also provide considerable planning and implementation support. Also, you don't need to develop something from scratch&#8212;you can generally volunteer at an event that is already in the works. There's room for everyone if you'd like to help out. To wit, we had a great talent show in Berkeley last summer. I was amazed at the level of performances (although I've been around too many Slugs to really be surprised at these feats anymore). My part? I helped lug sound equipment away afterwards. Talent or not, we can all participate!</p>
<h3>What's your best memory from your time at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>All of it! Well, a few things stand out. First, there's a bit of channeling of (UC President) Clark Kerr. In his memoir, "The Gold and the Blue," Kerr recalls experiencing campus at night, in 1965 after meeting with the inaugural class, and feeling "enchanted" by the magical setting. That sensation hit me as a new frosh&#8212;I remember this late afternoon orientation event on East Field, and being awe-struck by the view and the people&#8212;all of us there to learn and grow, in this wonderful environment.</p>
<p>Second, it's hard to count the number of great class sections, review sessions, discussions, etc., with so many different students on such rich topics.</p>
<p>Finally, there are memories from off-campus&#8212;an evening in Monterey, dinner in Paris at the start of a study abroad quarter, and interning at an academic conference in San Francisco. To quote Kerr, "The 'Santa Cruz dream' was drawing us forward. The years pass on but that memory never fades."&#160;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="13db4fe5807270465bc69e6ab7c0a29f"><name>fukunaga-emmy-win</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz alum wins Emmy for HBO drama ‘True Detective’</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz alumnus Cary Fukunaga picked up an Emmy Award last night in the category of “Outstanding Director for a Drama Series” for the HBO series True Detective.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, cary joji fukunaga, cary fukunaga, emmy awards, 2014 emmys, television news</keywords><start-date>1409083800000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz alum wins Emmy for HBO drama </display-name><path>/2014/08/fukunaga-emmy-win</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/fukunaga-emmy-win</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1409082412990</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1410367563116</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>History</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/Fukunaga-emmy-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/Fukunaga-emmy-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Fukunaga-emmy-300.jpg</name><display-name>Fukunaga-emmy-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>116989</file-size><width>300</width><height>251</height></image><image-alt>Cary Joji Fukunaga</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/08/images/Fukunaga-thumb1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/08/images/Fukunaga-thumb1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Fukunaga-thumb1.jpg</name><display-name>Fukunaga-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30087</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Cary Joji Fukunaga</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Cary Joji Fukunaga graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 1999 with a B.A. in history.

<p>The up-and-coming 37-year-old director, writer, producer, and cinematographer triumphed over a highly competitive field of colleagues, including the directors of<b> Breaking Bad, Downton Abbey, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, </b>and<b> Boardwalk Empire. </b></p>
<p><b>&#8220;</b>This is awesome&#8230;.I&#8217;m at a loss for words,&#8221; said Fukunaga, after the voiceover noted that his first job in Los Angeles was working as a camera production assistant for the video of Destiny&#8217;s Child&#8217;s &#8220;Survivor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hosted by<i> Late Night's</i> Seth Meyers, the star-studded 2014 Emmys took place at L.A.&#8217;s Nokia Theatre.</p>
<p>One of the most highly praised new shows of the year, <b>True Detective</b> premiered in January, starring actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as director, Fukunaga also serves as executive producer of the HBO series.</p>
<p><b>Fukunaga graduated from UC Santa Cruz</b> in 1999 with a B.A. in history. He first gained notice when he received the best "Directing, U.S. Drama" award at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival for his debut feature film <i>Sin Nombre</i>.</p>
<p>He wrote and directed <i>Sin Nombre</i>, based on his own firsthand experiences with Central American immigrants seeking a better life in the U.S.</p>
<p>Two years later, he followed up with <em>Jane Eyre,</em> his take on the classic novel by Charlotte Bronte. That film featured Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (Tim Burton&#8217;s <em>Alice in Wonderland<b>, </b></em>The Kids Are Alright) and Irish actor Michael Fassbender (Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s <em>Inglourious Baste<b>r</b>ds</em>, HBO&#8217;s Band of Brothers).</p>
<p>Fukunaga is currently editing his next film, <i>Beasts of No Nation</i>, starring British actor Idris Elba (<i>The Wire</i>), which is scheduled for release in 2015.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/01/2697.html</url><title>UCSC alumnus wins 2009 Sundance directing award for first feature film</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/fukunaga-jane-eyre.html</url><title>History alum winning acclaim for second feature film</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3c4cc85f807270466b1f05a10316aab9"><name>parking-permit-renewal</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renewal of parking permits for Fall 2014 - Staff and Faculty</title><summary>If you have not yet purchased or renewed your parking permit, please consider doing so before September 26.</summary><start-date>1409209200000</start-date><display-name>Renewal of parking permits for Fall 2014 </display-name><path>/2014/08/parking-permit-renewal</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/08/parking-permit-renewal</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1409760938031</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1409760938031</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>If you have not yet purchased or renewed your parking permit, please consider doing so now at&#160;<a href="http://basx2.ucsc.edu/application14/">http://basx2.ucsc.edu/application14/</a>.
