<p>The map provides information about temperatures at different layers of the world's atmosphere and traces the amount and distribution of water vapor on the planet. The findings have ramifications for the understanding of atmospheric dynamics and the formation of giant planets like Jupiter.</p>
<p>"Water is thought to play an important role in the formation of giant planets, since comet-like bodies bombard young planets, delivering most of the water and other molecules that we can observe," said Jonathan Fortney, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and a member of the team.</p>
<p>Fortney and postdoctoral researcher Mike Line did most of the theoretical work and modeling of the planet's atmosphere presented in two new papers, one published online in <i>Science</i> on October 2 and the other published in <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters</i> on September 12.</p>
<p>"These measurements have opened the door for a new kind of comparative planetology," said team leader Jacob Bean of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>The Hubble observations show that the planet, called WASP-43b, is no place to call home. It's a world of extremes, where seething winds howl at the speed of sound from a 3,000-degree-Fahrenheit day side that is hot enough to melt steel to a pitch-black night side that sees temperatures plunge below a relatively cool 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>As a hot ball of predominantly hydrogen gas, there are no surface features on the planet, such as oceans or continents that can be used to track its rotation. Only the severe temperature difference between the day and night sides can be used by a remote observer to mark the passage of a day on this world.</p>
<p>"Our observations are the first of their kind in terms of providing a two-dimensional map of the planet's thermal structure that can be used to constrain atmospheric circulation and dynamical models for hot exoplanets," added team member Kevin Stevenson of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>WASP-43b is located 260 light-years away and was first discovered in 2011. WASP-43b is too distant to be photographed, but because its orbit is observed edge-on to Earth, astronomers detected it by observing regular dips in the light of its parent star as the planet passes in front of it.</p>
<p>The planet is about the same size as Jupiter, but is nearly twice as massive. The planet is so close to its orange dwarf host star that it completes an orbit in just 19 hours. The planet is also gravitationally locked so that it keeps one hemisphere facing the star, just as our moon keeps one face toward Earth.</p>
<p>The scientists combined two previous methods of analyzing exoplanets and put them together in one for the first time to study the atmosphere of WASP-43b. Spectroscopy allowed them to determine the water abundance and temperature structure of the atmosphere. By observing the planet's rotation, the astronomers were also able to measure the water abundances and temperatures at different longitudes.</p>
<p>Because there's no planet with these tortured conditions in our solar system, characterizing the atmosphere of such a bizarre world provides a unique laboratory for better understanding planet formation and planetary physics. "The planet is so hot that all the water in its atmosphere is vaporized, rather than condensed into icy clouds like on Jupiter," said team member Laura Kreidberg of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>The water abundances in the giant planets of our solar system are poorly known because water is locked away as ice that has precipitated out of their upper atmospheres. But on "hot Jupiters" &#8212; that is, large planets like Jupiter that have high surface temperatures because they orbit very close to their stars &#8212; water is in a vapor that can be readily traced. Kreidberg also emphasized that the team didn't simply detect water in the atmosphere of WASP-43b, but also precisely measured how much of it there is and how it is distributed with longitude.</p>
<p>In order to understand how giant planets form, astronomers want to know how enriched they are in different elements. The team found that WASP-43b has about the same amount of water as we would expect for an object with the same chemical composition as the Sun. Kreidberg said that this tells something fundamental about how the planet formed.</p>
<p>For the first time astronomers were able to observe three complete rotations of a planet, which occurred during a span of four days. This was essential to making such a precise measurement according to Jean-Michel D&#233;sert of the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>
<p>The team next aims to make water-abundance measurements for different planets to explore their chemical abundances. Hubble's planned successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, will be able to not only measure water abundances, but also the abundances of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and methane, depending on the planet's temperature.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ccb5bbac807270466b1f05a1e84eef42"><name>puma-energetics</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce</title><summary>High-tech collars enabled scientists to track mountain lions in the wild and determine how much energy the big cats use to hunt their prey.</summary><keywords>Terrie Williams, Chris Wilmers, Gabriel Elkaim, mountain lions, wildlife tracking collars</keywords><start-date>1412272800000</start-date><display-name>Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce</display-name><path>/2014/10/puma-energetics</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/puma-energetics</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1412183734797</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412811187639</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Environmental Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/puma-illustration-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/puma-illustration-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>puma-illustration-450.jpg</name><display-name>puma-illustration-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>86536</file-size><width>450</width><height>199</height></image><image-alt>illustration of puma chasing a deer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/cougar-collar-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/cougar-collar-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cougar-collar-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cougar-collar-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23657</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>puma wearing tracking collar</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>In the background of this illustration are typical SMART collar accelerometer traces for walking and then running, while the foreground shows a collared puma chasing a black-tailed deer.

<p>The research team's findings, published October 3 in <i>Science</i>, help explain why most cats use a "stalk and pounce" hunting strategy. The new "SMART" wildlife collar--equipped with GPS, accelerometers, and other high-tech features--tells researchers not just where an animal is but what it is doing and how much its activities "cost" in terms of energy expenditure.</p>
<p>"What's really exciting is that we can now say, here's the cost of being a mountain lion in the wild and what they need in terms of calories to live in this environment," said first author Terrie Williams, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz. "Understanding the energetics of wild animals moving in complex environments is valuable information for developing better wildlife management plans."</p>
<p>The researchers were able to quantify, for example, the high energetic costs of traveling over rugged terrain compared to the low cost of "cryptic" hunting behaviors such as sit-and-wait or stalk-and-ambush movements. During the actual pounce and kill, the cats invest a lot of energy in a short time to overpower their prey. Data from the collars showed that mountain lions adjust the amount of energy they put into the initial pounce to account for the size of their prey.</p>
<p>"They know how big a pounce they need to bring down prey that are much bigger than themselves, like a full-grown buck, and they'll use a much smaller pounce for a fawn," Williams said.</p>
<p><strong>Cats on treadmills</strong></p>
<p>Before Williams and her team could interpret the data from collars deployed on wild mountain lions, however, they first had to perform calibration studies with mountain lions in captivity. This meant, among other things, training mountain lions to walk and run on a treadmill and measuring their oxygen consumption at different activity levels. Those studies took a bit longer than planned.</p>
<p>"People just didn't believe you could get a mountain lion on a treadmill, and it took me three years to find a facility that was willing to try," Williams said.</p>
<p>Finally, she met Lisa Wolfe, a veterinarian with Colorado Parks and Wildlife, who had three captive mountain lions (siblings whose mother had been killed by a hunter) at a research facility near Fort Collins, Colorado. After eight months of training by Wolfe, the mountain lions were comfortable on the treadmill and Williams started collecting data.</p>
<p><strong>Power animals</strong></p>
<div class="callout left wide"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWZOmD5uerQ" width="560"></iframe></div>
<p>According to Williams, the treadmill data showed that mountain lions do not have the aerobic capacity for sustained, high-energy activity. "They are power animals. They have a slow routine walking speed and use a burst of speed and the force of the pounce to knock down or overpower their prey," she said.</p>
<p>In addition to the treadmill studies, the captive cats were videotaped wearing the collars while doing a wide range of activities in a large outdoor enclosure. This provided a library of collar acceleration signatures specific for different behaviors, from resting and grooming to running and pouncing. "We got all the different behaviors videotaped and analyzed with the corresponding accelerometer traces," Williams said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, coauthor Chris Wilmers led a team that deployed the collars on wild cats in the Santa Cruz mountains. Wilmers, an associate professor of environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz, leads the <a href="http://santacruzpumas.org/">Santa Cruz Puma Project</a>, which has been tracking mountain lions in the area to study the effects of habitat fragmentation and developing new technology for understanding the animals' behavior and energetics.</p>
<p>"Because mountain lions are a cryptic animal, we can't really observe them hunting and killing prey. With the SMART collars, we can see how they go about doing that, what their strategies are, and how many calories they are expending to do it," Wilmers said. "The ability to estimate the field energetics of animals in the wild opens up a whole new suite of questions we can ask about the ecology of these animals, which ultimately informs not only our basic understanding of them but also their conservation and management."</p>

<p>Coauthor Gabriel Elkaim, professor of computer engineering at UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, worked on signal processing of the accelerometer data and is continuing to develop the state-of-the-art tracking collars. The prototype used in this study, called the Species Movement, Acceleration, and Radio Tracking (SMART) wildlife collar, was developed by computer engineering graduate student Matthew Rutishauser. The collars include a GPS unit, accelerometers, and a magnetometer to provide detailed data on where an animal is and what it is doing. "We hope this will be an enabling technology to allow a much greater depth of understanding of animals in the wild," Elkaim said.</p>
<p>The researchers now want to look at mountain lion energetics in a range of different habitat types. In particular, Wilmers said, he is interested in how human land use and habitat fragmentation may be influencing the energetic demands on mountain lions in the wild. Williams and her students also have projects using the new collar technology to study other large carnivores, including wolves, polar bears, and Weddell seals.</p>
<p>"A lot of these large carnivore species are threatened or endangered, and understanding their physiological limitations has been a big missing piece in conservation planning," Williams said. "This technology gives us a whole new level understanding of what these animals are doing and what it costs them to live in the wild, and that can really help move the science of conservation forward."</p>

Held in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society, the sale opens early (from 10 a.m. to noon) for members of either organization. Memberships will be on sale at the gate.</p>
<p>There are limited quantities of many of the hard-to-propagate plants, so eager gardeners are advised to arrive early. Among the newest plant varieties to be offered exclusively by the Arboretum are succulents and native monkey flowers. Bob Grim of San Jose hybridized the Arboretum's&#160; X <i>Sedeveria </i>'Suav&#233;' and X <i>Graptoveria </i>'Little Opal,' both succulents with beautiful wax on the leaves. The monkey flower <i>Mimulus </i>'Monkeys on Fire' is bright orange with red, while <i>Mimulus </i>'Ben Lomond Yellow' was selected by Arboretum staff from among thousands of the typically apricot-colored monkey flowers. The third new monkey flower is <i>Mimulus </i>'Tangelo,' which has flowers the color of the citrus fruit.</p>
<p>Sales benefit student gardener interns who are working their way through college by tending the Arboretum. The horticultural sales and memberships also benefit the Arboretum's conservation, research, and education programs.</p>
<p>The sale will feature an unusual selection of native and non-native species chosen to thrive in local gardens. Many are drought tolerant. A complete list is available on the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">Arboretum's web site</a>. Fall is a good time for planting because roots can establish themselves during the rainy season, which makes for a stronger and healthier plant to withstand the dry summer.</p>
<p>Other plants available at the sale will include feathery <i>Phyllica plumosa </i>and South African Proteas. Many of the succulents being sold are perfect plants for dorm rooms as well as the home garden, according to the curators. In addition to plants with different textures and origins for the garden palette, there will be flowers and foliage in a variety of colors. The sale will also feature some dramatic and lesser-known members of the protea family from Australia and South Africa.</p>
<p>For more information about the sale, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998 or visit the Arboretum's <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">web site</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/UCSCArboretum">Facebook page</a>. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="cda37da4807270466b1f05a1edb9ea0f"><name>annual-clery-act</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Required Federal Notices</title><summary> In compliance with federal law known as the Clery Act, the Annual Campus Security and Fire Safety Report 2013 is now available for you to read.</summary><start-date>1412146800000</start-date><display-name>Required Federal Notices</display-name><path>/2014/10/annual-clery-act</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/annual-clery-act</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1412199316830</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412199357463</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>University of California, Santa Cruz is committed to assisting all members of the community in providing for their own safety and security.&#160; In compliance with federal law known as the Clery Act, the<i><span> Annual</span> Campus Security and Fire Safety <span>Report</span> 2013</i> is available for you to read at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/crime-stats/files/fire-clery-2013.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ucsc.edu/about/crime-stats/files/fire-clery-2013.pdf</a>. <br/> <br/> If you would like to receive a hard copy of the<i><span> Annual</span> Campus Security and Fire Safety <span>Report</span> 2013</i>&#160; which contains this information, you can stop by the UC Santa Cruz Police Department, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064, or you can request that a copy be mailed to you by calling <a href="tel:831-459-2231" target="_blank" value="+18314592231">831-459-2231</a>.<br/> <br/> The report contains information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, fire safety, university police law enforcement authority, crime <span>reporting</span> policies, disciplinary procedures and other matters of importance related to security and safety on campus.&#160; It also contains information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by UC Santa Cruz; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.<br/> <br/> In addition, pursuant to the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, <span>annually</span> institutions of higher education must provide the campus community with how law enforcement agency information concerning registered sex offenders may be obtained.&#160; <br/> <br/> The State of California requires sex offenders to register with the police department in the jurisdiction in which they reside.

Max succeeds Sandra Faber, whose two-year appointment as interim director ended in June.</p>
<p>Max is internationally known for her research in plasma physics, astronomy, and astronomical instrumentation. A pioneer in the field of adaptive optics, she has served as director of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UC Santa Cruz. Max is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She received the U.S. Department of Energy's E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics in 2004.</p>
<p>UC Observatories (UCO) is a multicampus research unit headquartered on the UC Santa Cruz campus. UCO operates the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton and the UCO Technical Labs at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA, and is a managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. UCO is also the center for UC's participation in the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) project.</p>
<p>Max takes the helm of UCO at a time of tighter budgets throughout the UC system due to declines in state funding. Many astronomers have expressed concerns about a potential loss of funding from UC to support Lick Observatory. According to Max, however, ongoing discussions with UC administrators and efforts to develop a long-range plan for UCO have improved the outlook. She emphasized that there are no plans to close Lick Observatory.</p>
<p>"Financially, we are far from plush, but we're not in dire straits. We now have a fruitful relationship with the UC administration, and the situation is looking better than it did a year ago," Max said. "One of the things I am looking forward to is working with the UC astronomers to develop a vision and long-term plans for the future of UCO."</p>
<p>According to UC Provost and Executive Vice President Aimee Dorr, UC remains committed to the continued operation of Lick Observatory. "We want our faculty to have access to what they need to do their research and teach their students well. This includes Lick, as well as Keck and TMT," Dorr said. "With money tight, UC will need to be creative in finding ways to pay for what we want to do at all of these places. I am thrilled that Claire and others in the astronomy community have taken up this challenge."</p>
<p>Established in 1888, Lick Observatory continues to be a vital research facility where astronomers are able to conduct studies they couldn't do at other sites. Although Lick's telescopes are smaller than the 10-meter Keck Telescopes or the future Thirty-Meter Telescope, observing time is hard to get on the larger telescopes. For research that requires repeated observations over a long period of time, Lick's facilities are essential, Max said.</p>
<p>"For example, I have a project studying the Crab pulsar, and we can monitor it much more frequently at Lick than we could at Keck," she said. "Also, graduate students have much more access to the telescopes at Lick, so it is a very important facility for training future generations of astronomers."</p>
<p>Lick Observatory is also an important site for the development and testing of advanced technology that will ultimately be deployed on larger telescopes. For example, laser guide-star adaptive optics (AO) was largely developed by Max and colleagues from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Lick's 3-meter Shane Telescope, and then became the basis for the Keck Observatory's laser guide-star AO system. Lick's newest telescope is the 2.4-meter Automated Planet Finder, the first robotic telescope for finding potentially habitable planets around nearby stars.</p>
<p>The Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea houses the twin 10-meter Keck I and Keck II Telescopes and is operated by a scientific partnership among UC, the California Institute of Technology, and NASA. The UCO director serves on the Board of Directors of the California Association for Research in Astronomy, the governing board of Keck.</p>
<p>The TMT is currently scheduled for completion in the early 2020s. Site preparation work has been completed near the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, with a groundbreaking and blessing ceremony to be held on October 7. UC astronomers are active in many aspects of the design work and instrument development for TMT, including work at the UCLA instrument lab on the Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, which will be one of three first-light instruments on the giant telescope.</p>
<p>According to Max, UCO's instrument labs at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA are vitally important for both Keck and TMT. "That's where we build the instruments that allow astronomers to take advantage of these powerful telescopes," she said.</p>
<p>Max earned her A.B. degree in astronomy from Harvard University (Radcliffe College) and her Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences and plasma physics from Princeton University. She joined the UCSC faculty in 1999.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d1cd3c0b807270466b1f05a1a02ee284"><name>epc-gear-up</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Educational Partnership Center lands $3.27 million grant to help students achieve college</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz’s Educational Partnership Center has been awarded a $3.27 million federal grant over seven years to help prepare middle and high school students in the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District for college. </summary><keywords>uc, ucsc, uc santa cruz, university of California, educational partnership center, epc, gear-up, </keywords><start-date>1412269200000</start-date><display-name>EPC GEAR-UP</display-name><path>/2014/10/epc-gear-up</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/epc-gear-up</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1412269161431</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412269798850</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Maria Rocha-Ruiz</name><title></title><phone/><email> mgrruiz@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/epc_gear_up-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/epc_gear_up-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>epc_gear_up-450.jpg</name><display-name>epc_gear_up-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>115077</file-size><width>450</width><height>334</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/epc_gear_up-80.png</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/epc_gear_up-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>epc_gear_up-80.png</name><display-name>epc_gear_up-80.png</display-name><file-size>13198</file-size><width>80</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>GEAR-UP logo</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Christopher Mutshnick, left, lead college facilitator with the UC Santa Cruz Educational Partnership Center, assists <span>Gerardo</span><span>&#160;</span><span>Avina</span><span>, a Seaside High School senior, in </span><span>registering for the SAT and ACT.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s <a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu">Educational Partnership Center</a> has been awarded a $3.27 million federal grant over seven years to help prepare middle and high school students in the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District for college. The grant is one of 41 nationwide totaling $82 million as part of the<a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu/programs/gear-up.html"> Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP)</a> funded by the U.S. Department of Education. <br/><br/>&#8220;The GEAR UP college access programs are vital to our efforts to support lower-income students in their aspirations of joining the University of California,&#8221; said Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education.&#160; &#8220;I am particularly excited about this opportunity to expand UCSC&#8217;s collaborations with regional schools and to help individual students explore the possibilities of advanced education and student research on our campus.&#8221; <br/><br/>&#8220;Access to a quality education is necessary to break the cycle of poverty,&#8221; said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Carmel. &#8220;The GEAR UP program provides a needed connection between low-income students and a college degree. Thanks to the efforts of UCSC, Central Coast students from all economic backgrounds will now be ready to attend and graduate from college.&#8221;<br/><br/>The grant will help fund student academic and financial aid advising, tutoring, college field trips and other college-going activities.&#160; The program also includes professional development for teachers as they implement Common Core State Standards to prepare students for college and career. The grants continue the EPC's particular focus on working with K-12, local postsecondary and community partners, along with families, to create environments and support to help low-income, first generation college-bound students reach UC or another college or university.<br/><br/>"The GEAR UP grant allows the campus to provide significant outreach to help underserved students in the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District get on the pathway for success in college,&#8221; said Maria Rocha-Ruiz, executive director of UCSC's Educational Partnership Center. &#8220;We are looking forward to working with the district and targeted schools to widen the impact and build upon the foundation of the work already achieved in these schools by our staff, further building upon the existing college-going community for students and their families.&#8221;<br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz psychology professor Catherine Cooper, EPC's faculty director, will work with the program to study and improve strategies for sustaining college-going cultures across school sites, assessing family services in students&#8217; college pathways, and facilitating longitudinal analyses of students&#8217; multicultural college and career identities. She joins the project from Bridging Multiple Worlds Alliance (BMWA), a network of state, national, and international researchers, educators, and policymakers who work to open access to education from preschool through graduate school. &#160;<br/><br/>Faculty from the Center for Educational Research in the Interest of Underserved Students (CERIUS), a UC Santa Cruz- research unit affiliated with the UC Evaluation Center, will serve as the project&#8217;s external evaluator.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>&#160;UC Santa Cruz has recently been recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution, with 30 percent of undergraduates identifying as Hispanic or Latino backgrounds.&#160; The campus is also dedicated to students with financial need &#8211; 43 percent of undergraduates receive Pell grants, the federal government's need-based program for low-income undergraduates.<br/><br/>The Educational Partnership Center, a program of the UC Santa Cruz Division of Undergraduate Education, currently oversees two other GEAR UP programs: one in South Monterey County and another in the Pajaro Valley. The Center coordinates new and longstanding student academic preparation efforts of UC Santa Cruz with the goal of increasing access and opportunity to postsecondary education for students across the Monterey Bay and Silicon Valley/San Jose regions. <br/><br/>Through six vital programs (EAOP, MESA, COSMOS, Cal-SOAP, GEAR UP and the California Reading and Literature Project), and with support from federal and state funding, EPC provides an array of direct services which support students on the college-going pathway through tutoring, mentoring, academic planning and counseling, leadership training, test preparation, college awareness and enrichment, and teacher professional development.

installation </article-subhead><article-text><p>When fully opened, Felicia Rice&#8217;s book literally unfolds like an accordion along the length of a 30-foot table.</p>
<p>The product of a seven-year collaboration,<b> <i><a href="http://docundoc.com">DOC/UNDOC</a></i></b><i> </i>(<i>Documentado/Undocumented Ars Sham&#225;nica Perform&#225;tica)</i> is a multi-media&#8212;and multi-faceted&#8212;modern art book that explores the meaning of identity, legal documentation, racism, and appearance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the title and focal point of a new exhibition at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Sesnon Gallery, running October 3 through December 6.</p>
<p>The exhibition features a deluxe edition of Rice&#8217;s letterpress book, housed in a hi-tech case that contains a video (by film and digital media professor Gustavo Vazquez), an altar, and a &#8220;cabinet of curiosities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opening the case triggers light and interactive sound art by music lecturer Zachary Watkins.</p>
<p>The book also includes performance texts about the politics and personal experience of immigration by writer, performance artist, and MacArthur Fellow, <b><a href="http://docundoc.com/2014/07/06/guillermo-gomez-pena-2/">Guillermo G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a</a></b>, plus critical commentary by professor and art historian Jennifer Gonz&#225;lez.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an example of the 21st century artists&#8217; book,&#8221; explained Rice.&#160; &#8220;We are living in a time when the everyday book&#8217;s role is dwindling and, as often happens, the old technology becomes a new art form.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, the art piece is interactive in new ways, utilizing contemporary technologies in an unusual context,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>At the Sesnon Gallery, the book stands upright and snakes through the gallery on a specially built table. Its aluminum case is plugged in with headphones and participants can push blinking buttons to hear 48 short tracks&#8212;&#8220;some descriptive, all provocative,&#8221; including soundscapes, poetry, and street recordings.</p>
<p>The video plays simultaneously, and sound fills the room.</p>
<p><b>Rice came to UC Santa Cruz in 1974</b> to learn the craft of letterpress printing and the art of bookmaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began the work that has shaped my life right here at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; Rice noted. &#8220;I studied the history of the book and worked closely with pivotal figures of the West Coast book art world--Jack Stauffacher and William Everson.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1977, while still a student, she also founded <b><a href="http://www.movingpartspress.com">Moving Parts Press</a></b> in a garage downtown and began her career as a printer, teacher, literary/fine arts publisher, and book artist.</p>
<p>She received her degree in 1978 from UC Santa Cruz as an independent major in Fine Art Printing.</p>
<p>&#8220;After graduating, I taught seminars in book arts out of my studio for 14 years as a lecturer,&#8221; said Rice. &#8220;And in my 40s, I became an administrator on campus to support my chosen work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rice added that creating and producing a limited edition artists&#8217; book can be extremely labor intensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is &#8216;slow art&#8217;--developing the concepts is fast, but realizing such a complex project that blends the work of five artists takes time,&#8221; said Rice. &#8220;Making the 15 prints in each of the 65 books took years as each print went through the press 25 to 30 times--each sheet fed by hand, each sheet unique.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The coordination of all the moving parts in this project also took consistent effort over seven years,&#8221; she added. &#8220;As the publisher, that was my job as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><i>An opening reception for the exhibition takes place on October 15, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the Sesnon Gallery. Felicia Rice will also perform a series of monologues about the making of <b>DOC/UNDOC</b> on Oct. 22 at 7 p.m. at the gallery.

That process, involving more than 1,000 stakeholders, was designed to identify our most critical priorities for the next few years. Over the summer, the resulting 16 goals were evaluated by Envision co-chairs Peggy Delaney and Lynn Westerkamp and the Administrative Leadership Team for potential significance, breadth of impact, and distinction from other goals. As a result, we have six clearly defined goals.</p>
<p>The first goal is to make <b>strategic use of faculty lines</b> to maximize the impact of our limited resources for both instruction and research. Given that we have very few new resources and ever-broadening fields of academic inquiry, we cannot and should not expect to cover all topics. However, we can establish spheres of excellence on the research front while, as is our custom, we select faculty for their ability to teach broadly. By making strategic investments, UC Santa Cruz's reputation will be enhanced and our students will enjoy the benefits of an engaged, enthusiastic faculty.</p>
<p>To support those faculty and the growing research interests of our students, we need to<b> build the research infrastructure.</b> The Office of Research needs to develop its capacity to support larger projects, expand ties with industrial leaders, and facilitate the transfer of research findings to industry. We also must address the needs of research faculty in the areas of information technology, data archiving, and information access.</p>
<p>Our third goal is to develop programs that <b>significantly improve our retention and graduation rates</b>, particularly for our undergraduate students. Our campus, recognized as a minority-serving institution, has made significant progress in the academic success of our students. Additional action will accelerate this progress, allowing clear access points for students to get the support they need as they work toward their degrees.&#160;</p>
<p>Fourth, we must <b>cultivate a climate that supports our staff</b>, who have not only weathered the dramatic budget reductions and consequent workload changes in the last few years, but have also incorporated new technological processes and supported additional UC systemwide initiatives. Not only can we celebrate staff contributions to the campus, we can also, as a whole, help promote staff advancement through training and development and continue to seek staff input in designing the future of the campus.</p>
<p>Fifth, we will modify and revise our business processes to achieve an optimal <b>balance between efficiency and effectiveness</b> and between institutional risk and cost.&#160; This transformation should begin with each of us examining what we do to see if we can do it more effectively. Then we must go further and identify the "pain points" in campuswide business functions to find more effective solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, let's show our pride as Banana Slugs. We have an uncommon story to tell&#8212;one filled with world-changing research and world-changing students. We need to join together to<b> tell our story boldly, powerfully and joyously</b>. Our new publication, <i>Tuesday Newsday</i>, is a fabulous demonstration of that.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Alison Galloway, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d6e47713807270466b1f05a1bff5d20b"><name>volunteer-profile-madrid</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Volunteer profile: John Madrid</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz was and still is a magical place for me.

<h3>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was and still is a magical place for me. A huge part of what I learned there, both inside and outside of my declared major, was a sense of social justice and giving back to the community. These ideals have remained with me ever since I left UC Santa Cruz and are a key part of why I volunteer.</p>
<h3>Why types of things do you do as a Slug volunteer?</h3>
<p>I have had the privilege to serve on the Alumni Council for seven years, I was the treasurer for the LA chapter of UC Santa Cruz volunteers for two years, I help with hosting local happy hours for Los Angeles alumni, and I have participated in the high school outreach program.</p>
<h3>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</h3>
<p>The list is numerous. However, I have particularly enjoyed giving back to the campus and faculty that helped to shape my life in so many ways. Additionally, it has been such a pleasure to work with and meet incoming and existing students, as well as alumni of UC Santa Cruz. Some of my closest friends today are fellow alumni that I met while volunteering for campus.</p>
<h3>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>What are you waiting for? Volunteering for UC Santa Cruz not only provides you with the opportunity to give back to campus but also a chance to reconnect with current students and fellow alumni.</p>
<h3>What's your best memory from your time at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>There are hundreds, and I love getting the chance to re-live them whenever I visit campus. A few that stand out, however, are &#8220;surfing the web&#8221; for the first time in my life at the Oakes computer lab in the mid '90&#8217;s; getting accepted to the Education Abroad Program and having the opportunity to study abroad for a year; and exploratory walks on campus at night that included many false sightings of mountain lions, drum circles, and finding new paths to navigate campus.</p>

analysis of the world's top universities published by Times Higher Education (THE), <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2015/world-ranking/detailed#/sort/2/direction/desc">UC Santa Cruz ranked first in research</a> influence as measured by the number of times its faculty's published work is cited by scholars around the world.</p>
<p>Published as part of the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/world-ranking">THE World University Rankings 2014-15</a>, the analysis, conducted by Thomson Reuters, measured overall research influence based on the average number of citations per paper, using a database of more than 50 million citations to 6 million journal articles published over five years, from 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p>With a citation score of 100, UC Santa Cruz is tied for first place with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Other institutions with high citation scores were Rice University at 99.9 and California Institute of Technology at 99.7.</p>
<p>In describing their methodology, THE editors called the evaluation of research influence their "flagship" indicator. As explained on the web site for the World University Rankings, "it is the single most influential of the 13 indicators, and looks at the role of universities in spreading new knowledge and ideas."</p>
<p>THE has also ranked UC Santa Cruz 11th among the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014/one-hundred-under-fifty">top 100 universities under 50 years old</a>. UCSC's overall ranking in the THE World University Rankings for 2014-15 was 109th. It is one of eight UC campuses among the top 150 universities worldwide.</p>
<p>In another ranking published recently, the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/08/arwu-rankings.html">Academic Ranking of World Universities</a> (ARWU), UC Santa Cruz is ranked 93rd among the world's best universities and in the top 50 in the United States. Known as the "Shanghai ranking," ARWU is an annual study by the Shanghai Ranking Consultancy that looks at more than 1,200 universities in the world and publishes data on what it deems are the top 500.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/08/arwu-rankings.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz moves up in Shanghai ranking of world universities </title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/100-under-50.html</url><title>UCSC ranks 2nd in the U.S., 11th overall among universities under 50</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d72cd1d4807270466b1f05a13c886a89"><name>perspectives-palestine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Class features diverse voices on Israeli-Palestinian conflict </title><summary>"Perspectives on Israel/Palestine," beginning this month will feature a speakers series with diverse voices on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is open to the public. </summary><start-date>1412359200000</start-date><display-name>Perspectives in Palestine</display-name><path>/2014/10/perspectives-palestine</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/perspectives-palestine</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1412359311784</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412359493338</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/graphic-80.png</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/graphic-80.png</link><site>news</site><name>graphic-80.png</name><display-name>graphic-80.png</display-name><file-size>4323</file-size><width>80</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>A UC Santa Cruz class beginning this month will feature a speakers series with diverse voices on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br/><br/>"Perspectives on Israel/Palestine" is open to the public and will take place Tuesdays (with the exception of one Thursday) beginning October 7 from 6-7:45 p.m., at the Merrill Academy, Room102. <br/><br/>"The main goal is to help students and members of the public think in an informed and critical way about different narratives and perspectives associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," said Ella Ben Hagai, a UC Santa Cruz doctoral student in psychology who designed and will teach the class.<br/><br/>"We are hosting speakers with very diverse approaches to the conflict, and we hope this will help listeners synthesize different perspectives on the conflict into a multidimensional understanding of Israel/Palestinian issues," she said. <br/><br/><strong>Featured speakers</strong><br/>&#160;<br/>October 7: Christine King, lecturer, Kresge College,&#160;

<p>The program allows eligible career staff members, except Senior Management Group members, to voluntarily reduce their work hours by at least 10 percent a year for up to three years before retiring.&#160; Participants would receive a lump sum cash payment upon retiring that would be equal to half the amount of the reduction in time.</p>
<p>Originally offered in 2012 as part of the University&#8217;s cost savings and succession planning strategies, and scheduled to sunset at the end of this year, the core provisions of the proposed renewed program remain the same as the original program. The University is proposing that the program be renewed for a four-year period, effective January 1, 2015 and ending December 30, 2019.</p>
<p>The program and frequently asked questions are posted at: <a href="http://ucop.edu/human-resources/_files/phased-retirement.pdf">http://ucop.edu/human-resources/_files/phased-retirement.pdf</a></p>
<p>The policy&#8217;s scope applies to all non-represented staff employees. Non-represented staff employees who wish to provide comments on the proposed policy should direct their comments to Lori Castro at <a href="mailto:lhcastro@ucsc.edu">lhcastro@ucsc.edu</a> by October 22, 2014. &#160;Participation for exclusively represented employees is subject to collective bargaining.</p>

<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines service animals as dogs individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability. The work or task that the dog performs is directly related to the individual&#8217;s disability, and can include a wide variety of services, such as:</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Assist those with low vision;</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alert individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing;</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pull a wheelchair;</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Retrieve items such as medicine or the telephone;</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recognize and assist during seizures;</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Remind handler to take medication;</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Detect, prevent or interrupt the onset of a panic attack, or unwanted behaviors;</p>
<p>&#8226; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Assist with balance or stability.</p>
<p>Please be aware that some individuals using service animals do not have an obvious disability. Service dogs are not required to wear a vest or carry an identification card. To prevent&#160;misunderstandings and inappropriate inquiries, if you see a dog that you believe is not a service animal, we suggest that you <b>do&#160;not directly confront or question the person with the dog. </b>&#160;</p>
<p>The campus policy regarding service animals with appropriate contact information may be found at <a href="http://ada.ucsc.edu">http://ada.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Concerns about a service animal&#8217;s behavior&#160;may be directed to the Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety&#160;Services, (831) 459-3031. In case of an emergency related to safety, please call 911.</p>
<p>We appreciate your help in making UCSC a welcoming&#160;environment for people with disabilities and their service animals.</p>

I see new students consulting maps as they make their way to class&#8212;and returning students, faculty, and staff offering directions with a knowing smile. UC Santa Cruz is stunning, but it can be tricky for new students to find their way around during those first weeks. Fortunately, it's always nice to take an impromptu walk through the redwoods.<br/>
<br/>
I'm excited about the year ahead. In anticipation of our 50th anniversary, we are developing special programs that will unfold throughout the year. Look for details about events early next year with Angela Davis, Anita Hill, and other prominent speakers.<br/>
<br/>
One of the changes we're introducing this fall is a new weekly all-campus email, <em>Tuesday Newsday</em>. The goal is to highlight some of the great work taking place here, the media coverage we're receiving, and the priorities of campus leaders. Importantly, a "news you can use" section, called Heads Up, will compile all non-emergency administrative messages, including open-enrollment deadlines, human resources policy announcements, and professional development opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Tuesday Newsday</em> debuted last week. If you missed it, you can find it, including my fall keynote message, in the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/tuesday-newsday/2014/september-30/index.html">archives</a>. Look for each new issue in your in-box on Tuesdays, starting tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of notes about our students: With just over 4,000 new frosh, this is our biggest and one of our best-prepared classes. Another 1,100 junior-level transfers have joined us, as well as about 520 new graduate students. We have enrolled students from 33 countries and 37 states. More than one-third of our frosh come from traditionally underrepresented ethnic backgrounds, and a similar percentage are Asian American. Forty-one percent come from families in which neither parent earned a four-year college degree. Last year, nearly half our undergraduates received Pell grants, federal financial aid for the low-income students.<br/>
<br/>
UC Santa Cruz is a tremendous place to learn, work, and excel. Times Higher Education just ranked UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/THE-ranking.html">first in the world</a> for research impact, tied with MIT. We are consistently ranked one of the best young universities in the world, and my goal as we approach 50 is to be widely known as one of the best universities, period. Here's to a great year!<br/>

Para: la comunidad de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz<br/>
De parte de: Chancellor George Blumenthal<br/>
Sobre: &#161;Bienvenidas y bienvenidos al trimestre del oto&#241;o!<br/>
<br/>
&#161;Bienvenidas y bienvenidos al trimestre del oto&#241;o! Veo a estudiantes nuevas/os consultando mapas en su camino a sus clases &#8211;y a estudiantes que regresan, profesorado y personal dando direcciones con una sonrisa de complicidad. La UC Santa Cruz es impresionante, pero puede ser dif&#237;cil para las/os nuevas/os estudiantes orientarse y encontrar su camino durante las primeras semanas. Por suerte, siempre es agradable dar un paseo improvisado por las secoyas.<br/>
<br/>
Estoy muy entusiasmado con este a&#241;o acad&#233;mico que empieza. En anticipaci&#243;n de nuestro 50 aniversario, estamos preparando programas especiales que se desarrollar&#225;n durante todo el a&#241;o. Busque los detalles sobre los eventos a principios del pr&#243;ximo a&#241;o, con Angela Davis, Anita Hill y otras/os destacadas/os ponentes.<br/>
<br/>
Uno de los cambios que estamos introduciendo este oto&#241;o es un nuevo correo electr&#243;nico semanal en todo el campus: <em>Tuesday Newsday</em>. El objetivo es resaltar algunas de las grandes obras que tienen lugar aqu&#237;, la cobertura que estamos recibiendo de los medios de comunicaci&#243;n y las prioridades de las/os l&#237;deres del campus. Es importante destacar una secci&#243;n de &#8220;noticia que ustedes pueden utilizar&#8221;, llamada Heads Up, que compilar&#225; todos los mensajes administrativos que no sean de emergencia, incluyendo los plazos de inscripci&#243;n abierta, anuncios de las pol&#237;ticas de recursos humanos y las oportunidades de desarrollo profesional.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Tuesday Newsday</em> se estren&#243; la semana pasada. Si no lo vieron, pueden encontrarlo, incluyendo mi mensaje inaugural del trimestre del oto&#241;o, en los archivos, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/tuesday-newsday/september-2014/30/index.html">archives</a>. Todos los martes, busquen cada n&#250;mero nuevo en su buz&#243;n de entrada o Inbox, empezando ma&#241;ana.<br/>
<br/>
Un par de notas sobre nuestras/os estudiantes: con un poco m&#225;s de 4.000 estudiantes nuevas/os de primer a&#241;o, &#233;sta es una de nuestras clases m&#225;s grandes y mejor preparadas. Otras 1.100 transferencias de nivel inicial se nos han unido, as&#237; tambi&#233;n como unas/os 520 estudiantes nuevas/os de posgrado. Hemos inscrito a estudiantes de 33 pa&#237;ses y 37 estados. M&#225;s de un tercio de nuestras/os estudiantes de primer a&#241;o provienen de or&#237;genes &#233;tnicos tradicionalmente subrepresentados y un porcentaje similar es asi&#225;tico-americano. El cuarenta y uno por ciento proviene de familias en las que ninguno de los padres obtuvo un t&#237;tulo universitario de cuatro a&#241;os. El a&#241;o pasado, casi la mitad de nuestras/os estudiantes de pregrado recibieron becas Pell: ayuda financiera federal para estudiantes de bajos ingresos.<br/>
<br/>
La Universidad de California en Santa Cruz es un lugar extraordinario para aprender, trabajar y sobresalir. Times Higher Education acaba de clasificar primera del mundo a la UC Santa Cruz, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/THE-ranking.html">first in the world</a>, por el impacto de la investigaci&#243;n, empatada con MIT. Consistentemente, se nos clasifica como una de las mejores universidades j&#243;venes del mundo, y a medida que nos acercamos a los 50, mi objetivo es que sea conocida como una de las mejores universidades, punto. &#161;Brindo aqu&#237; por un gran a&#241;o!<br/>

"We hope to match the size and proportion of graduate education at other UC campuses where the percentage of graduate students is typically more than 15 percent," Miller said. &#160;<br/><br/><a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/prospective-students/index.html">Graduate applications</a> to UCSC this year reached a historic high at 4,259, up more than 18 percent from a year ago. The increase is consistent with an upward trend that's been happening since 2007. <br/><br/>Miller said graduate enrollment is projected to be 1,633 this year. A year ago 1,465 graduate students were enrolled; 1,389 were enrolled in 2012. &#160;<br/><br/>The number of new international students has grown to 132 in 2014, up from 84 in 2013 and 49 in 2012, Miller said.&#160; Much of the growth in international students has been at the Baskin School of Engineering, where nearly 78 percent of applicants are from outside the United States. <br/>&#160;<br/>Miller said the increase in graduate students also reflects efforts in developing new graduate programs including Ph.D.s in Latin American and Latino Studies, Feminist Studies, Visual Studies, and Film and Digital Media, and new Masters degree programs in Technology and Information Management, Games and Playable Media, and Theater Arts. &#160;<br/><br/>He said he expects the increases to continue over the next several years with investment in new faculty, additional graduate support, and further new professionally oriented Masters programs, especially Silicon Valley-related programs in areas such as Data Science.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Graduate

href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/morrison-founders-lecture.html">Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture</a> at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz on October 25, and received the UC Santa Cruz Foundation

<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/morrison-davis-q-a.html"><strong><em>Read an extended Q&amp;A with Toni Morrison and Angela Davis. </em></strong></a></p>
<p>At 83, Toni Morrison has no plans to retire. At this point in her career, that kind of drive has little to do with unmet goals; the Nobel Prize winner has written 10 novels, a play, and many nonfiction pieces. Her body of work, including the novel <i>Beloved,</i> which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988, is already part of the literary canon.</p>
<p>But Morrison, speaking by phone in her distinctive low, whispery voice from her home in New York's Hudson Valley, said she just can't be happy without a project. Her creative impulse and her desire for artistic freedom are as strong as ever.</p>
<p>"Writing novels is the world to me," she said. "The outside world can be OK or not OK, beautiful or not beautiful, but I am in control here," said Morrison, who still scratches out the first drafts of her novels with a pencil on yellow legal pads. "When I'm writing, nobody's telling me what to do. The expectations are high because they are mine, and that is a kind of freedom I don't have anywhere else. Nowhere."</p>
<p>While Morrison was a well-known literary figure before <i>Beloved,</i> that book's blockbuster success took her into the mainstream&#8212;a remarkable feat, considering the novel's unflinching look at slavery. Its main character, Sethe, based on real-life escaped slave Margaret Garner, kills one of her children to spare her a life of enslavement.</p>
<p>The impact of <i>Beloved</i>&#8212;and Morrison's writing output as a whole&#8212;cannot be overstated, said Angela Davis, the scholar, activist, and UC Santa Cruz professor emerita who will introduce Morrison at the Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture.</p>
<p>Morrison, through fiction, has made social change, a feat many others haven't been able to accomplish through nonfiction writing and activism, Davis said.</p>
<p>"I don't think that our notion of freedom would be what it is without the impact of Toni Morrison."</p>
<p>Beloved "helped us think about U.S. history in an entirely different way," Davis said, and Morrison's specificity&#8212;including her elegantly crafted characters&#8212;helped change "the abstractness of the portrayal of slavery.&#8230; It became possible to humanize slavery, to remember that the system of slavery did not destroy the humanity of those whom it enslaved."</p>
<p>The two have been friends since the early '70s, when Morrison, while working as an editor at Random House, edited Davis's autobiography. During that period, Morrison was bringing out new works by uncompromising authors including the African American feminist writers Toni Cade Bambara and Gayl Jones.</p>
<p>Morrison, once an outsider, went on to change the face of publishing, both as a writer and editor, said Paul Skenazy, professor emeritus of literature at UC Santa Cruz, who taught Morrison's work for years.</p>
<p>"At this point, more than a quarter century later, it's hard to remember how compact and insular the publishing world was before Morrison, Maxine Hong Kingston, and others made cracks in it," Skenazy said.</p>
<p>Morrison's book <i>Song of Solomon</i> is as smart and evocative as writing gets, Skenazy said.</p>
<p>"Her ability in that book to move across fantasy and the hard terms of black life; to turn folk stories into palpable mythologies that rule the everyday; to make a quest of forgotten, unspoken, hidden, and discarded history: These are beautifully entangled in that book."</p>
<h3>The silence of goodness</h3>
<p>Writing gives Morrison more than the freedom to imagine worlds beyond her own. Her books allow her to explore a topic that has been tugging at her for more than 40 years, and which she will explore during the Santa Cruz lecture: "Literature and the Silence of Goodness."</p>
<p>Morrison believes an "obsession" with evil has crept into literature over the past century or so while the forces of good have been driven to the sidelines and compelled to bite their tongues.</p>
<p>Morrison thinks this preoccupation, which she credits in part to the horrors of World War I, also holds true in the media. She spoke of news reports that portrayed the Amish community as "freakish" when members of the religious group reached out to comfort the widow of an Amish man who took his own life after committing a killing spree that left five schoolgirls dead. TV broadcasts and newspapers "twisted" what Morrison considered to be a selfless refusal on the part of the community to seek vengeance.</p>
<p>She believes the media has a lurid obsession with things like mass killings, brazen kidnappings, and heinous abuse and neglect, and that it is simply "too easy" to let such forces dominate works of fiction.</p>
<p>Evil, she says, often has a superficial glamour in stories and novels: "I always think of evil with a top hat and a big band and a cape, a cane maybe, some shiny jewelry so you are very attracted by the glitter."</p>
<p>On the other hand, compelling portrayals of good are harder to pull off, Morrison said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, "there really isn't anything else that humans ought to be cultivating and living for," she said. "The rest of it is petty and selfish: cartoonish almost."</p>
<p>She talks about her efforts to dramatize good without resorting to sentimentality. She mentioned the strong women who nurse an ailing woman back to health in her most recently published novel, <i>Home</i>. There is nothing warm or cuddly about these "country women who loved mean &#8230; They didn't waste their time or the patient's with sympathy and they met the tears of suffering with resigned contempt."</p>
<p>But these women are forces for good because they have an innate desire to heal and save lives. "When their maker said, 'What did you do?,' they didn't want to say, 'Well, uh.&#8230;'" Morrison said. "They had to answer."</p>
<h3>Revealing revelations</h3>
<p>Some readers may be surprised to hear Morrison's concerns about literary evil, considering its strong presence in so many of her books, which contain, among other things, a gang rape, gruesome depictions of slavery, and an act of infanticide.</p>
<p>Morrison concedes "there is a lot of sadness and melancholy among the people in my books," but "for me, there is always an ending in which somebody knows something extremely important that they didn't know before; the acquisition of knowledge is a gesture of mine toward goodness.</p>
<p>"The accumulation of events, theories, changes of mind, encounters, whatever is going on, at the end of the book, it tends to move toward some kind of epiphany that is a revelation of a better self."</p>
<p>As Morrison pointed out, during one horrific rape scene early in her novel <i>Love,</i> one character, Romen, refuses to participate and is shunned by his peers. Romen comes to realize he has repressed his instinctual desire to help the girl and ends up reaching out to her.</p>
<p>And the infanticide at the center of <i>Beloved</i> is a morally complex act of desperation. During the interview, Morrison spoke of her deliberate withholding of judgment of Sethe. "Suppose I knew definitely that my boys&#8212;my children&#8212;were going to be kidnapped, taken off, molested: What would I do? And I couldn't answer." (Morrison is the mother of two sons, Harold and Slade; Slade died in 2010 at age 45.)</p>
<h3>Resisting cynicism</h3>
<p>Morrison said she simply could not create her works if she wrote out of a place of cynicism or despair. This is not to say that her faith never wavers.</p>
<p>Sometimes the realm of politics and the cruelty of world events wear her down.</p>
<p>Once, 10 years ago, she was feeling especially "sad and disturbed," she said. "Whatever it was, it was paralyzing. Peter Sellars [the theater and opera director, who has collaborated with Morrison] called up as he often does on Christmas Day or during the holidays.&#8230; He said, 'How are you?,' and I said that I didn't feel very good.</p>
<p>"I said, 'You know, Peter, I can't write,' and I told him why I thought I couldn't, and he started shouting, 'No, no, no, no!' He said this is precisely the time when artists go to work, not when everything is fine but when things were difficult. Dire. This is when we're needed."</p>

This grant from the <a href="http://www.genome.gov/">National Human Genome Research Institute</a> (NHGRI) funds the Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics, a multi-institutional partnership based at UC Santa Cruz and led by David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the <a href="http://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</a>.</p>
<p>According to Haussler, the center's overarching goal is to help the biomedical community use genomic information to better understand human health and disease. To do this, scientists must be able to share and analyze genomic datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than those that can be handled by the existing infrastructure. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have made it increasingly affordable to sequence a person's entire genome, but managing genomic and related data from millions of individuals is a daunting challenge.</p>
<p>"Sequencing technology has run ahead of our ability to handle the data. We need to rework the informatics systems and the way we represent and handle genomic data," Haussler said.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic contributions to disease</strong></p>
<p>At least half of all diseases have a substantial genomic component. Only by studying the genomes and related information from very large numbers of individuals will scientists have the statistical power to discover and understand the contribution to disease of individually rare but collectively common genetic variants, Haussler said.</p>
<p>"It's hard for people to appreciate the size of these datasets. If you're talking about a million genomes, it's a stunning amount of data, and it's very difficult to move these large datasets, even over optical fiber," he said.</p>
<p>Haussler and his team at UC Santa Cruz have extensive experience managing large amounts of genomic data. Charged with creating a repository for The Cancer Genome Atlas and other large projects for the National Cancer Institute, they built the <a href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Cancer Genomics Hub</a> (CGHub), the largest public database of cancer genome sequences in the world. CGHub was the first "NIH Trusted Partner" authorized to distribute genome sequence data to biomedical researchers. It currently holds more than 1.5 petabytes of data (1,675,348 gigabytes, at the latest count). Haussler's team also created the UCSC Genome Browser, the most popular web portal for accessing human DNA data.</p>
<p>For the new center, Haussler has teamed up with other leading experts in genomics and data science, including principal investigators Laura van 't Veer, director of applied genomics at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and David Patterson, professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. Other partners include researchers at Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Sage Bionetworks, Oregon Health and Science University, California Institute of Technology, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, King's College London, and McGill University.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Pilot projects</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics will develop new protocols and tools for genomic data and test them in four pilot projects. According to Haussler, the genomics community must develop a standard, globally accepted set of specialized Internet protocols for handling genomic data efficiently. "It turns out that genomic information is quite complicated, so it's a massive undertaking, and we're very excited about building this new infrastructure," he said.</p>
<p>The pilot projects will not only benefit from the technical infrastructure developed by the center, but will also help guide the development of that infrastructure by providing essential feedback. These projects include the <a href="http://www.uk10k.org/">UK10K</a> project to identify rare genetic changes with harmful phenotypic consequences, led by team member Richard Durbin of the Sanger Institute; the <a href="https://icgc.org/">International Cancer Genome Consortium</a>'s 2,000 tumor pan-cancer analysis project, co-led by team members Josh Stuart at UC Santa Cruz, Lincoln Stein at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, and others; the <a href="http://ispy2.org/">I-SPY 2</a> adaptive breast cancer trial, co-led by PI van 't Veer at UCSF; and the Beat AML leukemia therapy project, led by team member Brian Druker at Oregon Health and Science University.</p>
<p>Three of the four projects are cancer-related, not because other disease areas are considered less critical, but because cancer genomics is progressing unusually rapidly and represents a high-water mark for the representation and analysis of genomic information and its translation into clinical practice, Haussler said. "If you can build general informatics infrastructure for genomics in cancer, with thousands of potential driver mutations and more than 1,000 targeted treatment compounds in the current drug development pipelines, then this general infrastructure will be adaptable to other disease areas without needing to be scaled up," he said.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical applications</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, the center aims to extend the platforms developed for genomic research into regular clinical practice. Analyzing the genomic information from individual patients is potentially an extremely powerful clinical tool, and the use of genomics in clinical practice could increase dramatically the amount of genomic data available for study.</p>
<p>According to Haussler, however, changes are needed not only to the technical infrastructure, but also to the "social infrastructure" related to the sharing of genomic data. "We need to develop the legal, ethical, and social organization of shared consent so that we can share and learn from DNA sequences without threatening the privacy of individuals," he said.</p>
<p>This is one of the goals of a new international nonprofit alliance Haussler cofounded, the <a href="http://genomicsandhealth.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health</a>, which now includes nearly 200 of the world's largest medical centers, patient advocacy groups, and research institutions. "Right now, genomics data is being siloed away in the databases of individual medical centers. Only a tiny portion is being shared," Haussler said. "We want to create a new digital commons for responsible and confidential sharing of genomic and clinical data."</p>
<p>The Center for Big Data in Translational Genomics is one of several centers that have been funded by the <a href="http://bd2k.nih.gov/#sthash.umju7bQe.KNGJ1wNz.dpuf">NIH Big Data to Knowledge</a> (BD2K) initiative, and it is the only BD2K center focused on genomics. The goal of the BD2K initiative is to develop innovative and transforming approaches that make big data and data science a prominent component of biomedical research. Centers focused in different big data areas will work together to achieve this goal.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/01/stem-cell-genomics.html</url><title>UCSC partners with Stanford, Salk Institute in stem cell genomics center</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/07/global-alliance-api.html</url><title>Global Alliance for Genomics and Health unveils new genomics interface</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/11/hitachi-agreement.html</url><title>Hitachi sponsors UCSC research in cancer genomics and data storage</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f1223ba6807270466b1f05a1f35dbfa4"><name>blumenthal-nih</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz wins $11 million grant to advance biomedical research</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal congratulates the campus team tapped by the National Institutes of Health to lead a project that could revolutionize biomedical research.</summary><keywords>blumenthal, NIH, haussler, genomics, infrastructure, database, grant</keywords><start-date>1412865000000</start-date><display-name>Blumenthal-NIH</display-name><path>/2014/10/blumenthal-nih</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/blumenthal-nih</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1412794825567</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412794872020</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced today that it has selected UC Santa Cruz to take the lead on a project that could revolutionize biomedical research and, ultimately, the practice of medicine itself.<br/><br/>NIH has awarded $11 million to the campus to build the technical infrastructure that will facilitate the sharing and analysis of enormous amounts of genomic data&#8212;information that holds the potential to advance our understanding of human health and disease.

academic year on Tuesday, October 28, at the Digital Arts Research Center.</p>
<p>The Leonardo Art/Science Evening Rendezvous (LASER) is a national program of evening gatherings that bring artists, scientists, and scholars together for informal presentations and conversations.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8232;The goal of the series is to feature compelling new developments in the arts and sciences, and to attract audiences that would not normally be found at the same gathering.</p>
<p>The October 28 event will include presentations by three UC Santa Cruz professors--<b>Carolyn Dean</b> <i>("Moving Stones: An Inka Perspective"</i>), <b>Stacy Philpott</b> (&#8220;<i>Urban Garden Insect Biodiversity: Fascinating and Functional"</i>), and <b>Karen Tei Yamashita</b> (reading from her new book <i>Anime Wong: Fictions of Performance</i>)--plus scientist and artist <b>David Glowacki</b> from the University of Bristol (UK) and Stanford (<em>"Modeling Humans as Energy Fields")</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As with previous LASER events, what we are looking for is depth and disciplinary range in our speakers, leading to an evening that takes your mind in a number of different directions,&#8221;<b><i> </i></b>said John Weber, founding director of UCSC&#8217;s Institute of the Arts and Sciences. <b>&#160;</b></p>
<p>LASERs are about serendipitous rather than planned connections,&#8221; Weber added, &#8220;and I'm sure this group of speakers will achieve that.&#8221; &#160;</p>
<p><b>David Glowacki</b> has an international reputation spanning both computational nano-physics and interactive digital art. He is the creator of <a href="http://danceroom-spec.com/">danceroom spectroscopy</a>, an interactive science-meets-art installation that has introduced the beauty and complexity of the atomic world to thousands of people across the UK and Europe.</p>

 <br/>
 Perry (psychology and sociology, '86) and her partner Sandra Stier sued the Alameda County clerk after they were denied a marriage license in May 2009. Their case was one of several that challenged the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8 that banned same sex marriages after voters approved it in November 2008.<br/>
 <br/>
 In August 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled for the plaintiffs, overturning Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which last year let the lower court ruling stand. <br/>
 <br/>
 Perry and the legal case were featured in the HBO Documentary "The Case Against 8." At Monday's event she will make a presentation and take part in a discussion of the issues of same-sex marriage and&#160; legal challenges to state bans. <br/>
 <br/>
 Kelly Weisberg, professor of law at UC Hastings College of Law, will present an introductory talk, "Setting the Stage for the Same-Sex Marriage Cases." Weisberg is married to Chancellor Blumenthal. <br/>
 <br/>
 Perry is executive director of the First Five Years Fund, a national organization that works to achieve better results in education, health, and economic productivity. In addition to her B.A. from UCSC she holds a masters degree in social work from San Francisco State University.<br/>
 <br/>
 Perry and Stier, who have been together since 1997, first tried to marry in 2004 after San Francisco began issuing licenses to gay and lesbian couples. Now married, they are the parents of four boys. <br/>
 <br/>
 Perry's presentation is presented by the Staff Diversity Group and the Cant&#250; Queer Center at UC Santa Cruz.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f66a2361807270466b1f05a1d7fda99a"><name>guthman-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A decade later: How the organic foods movement has grown and evolved</title><summary>Professor Julie Guthman's "Agrarian Dreams: The Paradox of Organic Farming in California," was hailed as the first social science study of organic foods in the United States.

Sixty percent of consumers now say they buy organics at least occasionally. Most supermarkets feature an organics section or private label for organics.&#160; For a while organic sales grew at a 20 percent a year clip. <br/><br/>In a new second edition just published (University of California Press) Guthman, a professor of social sciences and UC Santa Cruz alumna (Kresge, '79, sociology), takes a new look at the state of the organic food movement and some of the strange puzzles that afflict it. <br/><br/>"We've seen the increased legitimacy of organics in the policy arena," Guthman said. "Many conventional growers talk about trying organics or have even converted some acreage to organics. They may be doing it solely for market demand, but they no longer see it as this this weird fringe movement."<br/><br/>But along with political and market acceptance have come some contradictions and restrictions on further growth. Some niches are successful while others areas are more marginal. <br/><br/>For one thing growth has slowed to 7 percent per year and the percentage of land in the U.S. devoted to organic production is still tiny&#8211;about 1 percent&#8211;compared with conventional agriculture. Many growers go into organics and then get out again depending on market conditions. <br/><br/>This happened during the 2008-2009 recession, Guthman says, and "really speaks to the vulnerability of the organic industry to economic downturns."<br/><br/>Guthman has updated her second edition of Agrarian Dreams and added a new chapter eight: "California Organics, Fifteen Years On."&#160; As she explains, the new edition reflects changes over a 15-year-period from 1998 when she completed her initial research as a graduate student and last year when she finished the update. <br/><br/>Guthman said she finds that the smaller "artisanal" growers make up only about 7 percent of the market but many do quite well.&#160; They sell direct to consumers through farmers markets or through specialty stores and restaurants. <br/><br/>Larger "quasi-conventional" growers that sell to chains or processing companies are more vulnerable to price fluctuations and a weak or unstable economy. This is an area that could grow further and faster if policies were different. <br/><br/>Guthman still has concerns with the organic label and the standards mandated to earn the label. The current system of regulation does not encourage widespread transformation, she says. <br/><br/>"By and large organic material are&#160; safer than conventional ones, and some organic techniques are better than others," she said. But she finds the certification system can work against a wider adoption of organics. "The whole system of regulation, in which growers agree to abide by a set of standards and go through the bureaucratic rigmarole of third party certification in return for a price premium means that consumers must necessarily pay more," she said. "If people won't or can&#8217;t pay, (growers) won't convert their farms to organic."<br/><br/>Guthman calls for other polices beside labels and suggests that more university research focuses on biological, mechanical and other less-chemical intensive techniques. "We also need to look at our current pesticide regulations and subsidy systems and develop other ways to encourage the reduction of harmful chemicals," she said.<br/><br/>"Lot of growers would like to experiment with new techniques," she said. "But with organics you're either all in or all out."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f69ba7a2807270466b1f05a1cc5a9eb1"><name>hunt-in-memoriam</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Geoffrey 'Craig' Hunt</title><keywords>Craig Hunt</keywords><start-date>1412838000000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam: Geoffrey "Craig" Hunt</display-name><path>/2014/10/hunt-in-memoriam</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/hunt-in-memoriam</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1412886669164</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1412969784928</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value><value>Administrative Message</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>I am sad to inform you that the pilot killed in the very recent air tanker crash fighting a Yosemite fire is Craig Hunt. Craig worked for us as a course assistant teaching general chemistry and organic chemistry labs, usually during the winter months when he got a break from his duties fighting fires in Northern California. Craig's love for teaching led him to enroll in a course-work masters degree program, which he completed during the winter and spring quarters of 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/about/fire_protection_memorial_hunt.php">Cal Fire memorial web page</a>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;">Geoffrey "Craig" Hunt was born October 14, 1951, in Richmond, IN. He is survived by his wife, Sally, whom he married September, 1975. Hunt served as a U.S. Navy P3 Pilot from 1975-1984 and was in the reserves for 20 years. Hunt earned a masters in business from the University of Southern California and a masters in biochemistry from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and served as a chemistry teacher in the off season at UC Santa Cruz. He had a love for flying, golfing, fishing, hiking, bird watching, scuba diving, math/sciences, teaching, and dogs.</p>
<p>In a recent email to the department, Craig wrote: "We've had a busy fire season this summer, working the Morgan fire by Livermore right now. I hope you'll have a position for me next quarter as I certainly enjoy the opportunity [to teach]." (September 15, 2014)</p>
<p>On behalf of the department, my heartfelt condolences to Craig's family, coworkers, and friends.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Ilan Benjamin, Chair, Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f6dcdef0807270466b1f05a1d96bc528"><name>mcdowell-techcrunch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Computer scientist Charlie McDowell recognized as advocate for women in tech</title><summary>McDowell and alumnus Jacob Martinez are featured on a list of "10 Men Making Waves for Women in Tech"</summary><keywords>NCWIT, Project Awesome, Girls in Engineering, women in engineering, women in technology</keywords><start-date>1412924400000</start-date><display-name>Computer scientist Charlie McDowell recognized as advocate for women in tech</display-name><path>/2014/10/mcdowell-techcrunch</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/mcdowell-techcrunch</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1412890943158</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414083798730</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/charlie-mcdowell-420.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/charlie-mcdowell-420.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>charlie-mcdowell-420.jpg</name><display-name>charlie-mcdowell-420.jpg</display-name><file-size>77058</file-size><width>420</width><height>324</height></image><image-alt>Charlie McDowell</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/charlie-mcdowell-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/charlie-mcdowell-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>charlie-mcdowell-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>charlie-mcdowell-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21151</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Charlie McDowell</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Charlie McDowell (Photo courtesy of NCWIT)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>McDowell and alumnus Jacob Martinez featured on technology news site's list of "10 Men Making Waves for Women in Tech"</article-subhead><article-text><p>Charlie McDowell, professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, is recognized as "a tireless advocate for women in tech" in an article on the technology news site <a href="http://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>McDowell is featured as one of "<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/08/10-men-making-waves-for-women-in-tech/">10 Men Making Waves for Women in Tech</a>," a list that also includes alumnus Jacob Martinez (B.S., ecology and evolutionary biology, '05), director of the Watsonville <a href="http://www.etr.org/youthandit/">Tecnolog&#237;a-Educaci&#243;n-Comunidad</a> (TEC) program.</p>
<p>The article--by Ruthe Farmer, chief strategy and growth officer at the <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/">National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology</a> (NCWIT)--notes that while female role models are important for women in tech, male advocates are also an essential part of the solution to the shortage of women in the technology workforce.</p>
<p>McDowell is active on the national level as well as locally in efforts to encourage more young women to pursue careers in computer science and technology. At UC Santa Cruz, where he served until recently as associate dean of engineering for undergraduate affairs, McDowell is involved in programs such as <a href="http://awesome.soe.ucsc.edu/">Project Awesome</a>, an ongoing effort to recruit and retain more women students in computer science and computer engineering, and <a href="https://gie.soe.ucsc.edu/">Girls in Engineering</a>, a summer camp for middle-school girls.</p>
<p>"Charlie's unwavering commitment to increasing the participation of women and girls in computing has fueled a number of new initiatives that are really having an impact in our local region and for our campus," said Adrienne Harrell, director of undergraduate student affairs in the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>

Today, the campus uses about 178 million gallons of water annually&#8211;scarcely more water than the 170 million gallons we used in 1993-94, despite having nearly 7,000 more students.<br/><br/>We have kept a lid on water use by investing in infrastructure, education, and outreach. This longstanding commitment to water conservation has helped us exceed the City of Santa Cruz's current mandate to reduce our use by 20 percent from 2012-13 levels. As the campus, community, and state confront the specter of unprecedented drought, we are taking additional short-term and long-term steps to be even more frugal with water.<br/><br/>Our current efforts build on work that began in 2007, when the campus conducted a major water efficiency study. The study identified 19 high-impact projects, all of which were completed by 2013. We retrofitted plumbing fixtures, replaced turf, improved our metering and monitoring program to capture more fine-grained data about our water use, and launched educational programs for students who live on campus. These smart investments have saved &#8211; and will continue to save &#8211; about 30 million gallons annually. <br/><br/>And we're not done. Residential students account for about 50 percent of campus water consumption, and our students have been great partners in raising awareness about the need to conserve. Our Student Environmental Center even sponsored a friendly water-reduction competition among colleges and residence halls as part of its outreach. <br/><br/>The campus is investing in new water-conservation projects this academic year. We will be installing more meters, removing more turf, replacing more high-flow toilets, testing a water-wise alternative to water-guzzling sterilization systems in labs, and installing weather-smart irrigation timers in housing areas. Speaking of meters, we now have 450 "sub-meters" installed across campus, yielding highly detailed information about water use. These and other high-tech devices, combined with the expertise of our dedicated staff, are powerful tools that are boosting our conservation efforts.<br/><br/>The campus has established a Water Shortage Working Group to identify short-term projects and strategies to cope with the current drought and to ensure that the campus is abiding by current water restrictions. <br/><br/>Looking ahead, Chancellor Blumenthal has launched a Water Conservation Task Force to assess campus water use, target areas where use could be reduced over time, and recommend strategies to implement reductions. <br/><br/>Drawing on the passion of our students and the strength of faculty research, we are well-positioned to continue our role as a water-conservation leader and a strong partner in the work of finding long-term solutions. A number of faculty are engaged in water-related research, including Andy Fisher, professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Brent Haddad, professor of environmental studies and technology management and director of the Center for Integrated Water Research. For students, water issues are an integral part of the curriculum in courses such as Freshwater Ecology, Agroecosystem Analysis and Watershed Management, and California Water Law and Policy. <br/><br/>For all of us, water conservation must become a way of life.

<p>The new department, which builds on the strong programs UC Santa Cruz has established in computer game design, is the first of its kind in the world, said Michael Mateas, chair of the department and director of the <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a> at UCSC.</p>
<p>"There is a growing recognition that computer games as we know them today are just the tip of an iceberg," Mateas said. "Games are the harbingers of a new, fundamentally computational, and deeply interactive medium. It's like cinema at the beginning of the 20th century. We're seeing the birth of a fundamentally new form of expressive communication, and we have a leadership role in helping to invent it here at UC Santa Cruz."</p>
<p>The Computational Media Department will oversee the existing B.S. degree in computer game design, as well as the M.S. degree in games and playable media (pending approval of the transfer). New degree programs are also being planned. The faculty of the new department includes six tenure-track faculty and five adjunct faculty, drawn primarily from the departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering.</p>
<p>As a discipline, computational media combines the theories and research approaches of the arts and humanities with those of computer science to analyze, explore, and enable the computer as a medium for creative expression. In addition to games, other examples of computational media include social media, smart-phone apps, and virtual reality experiences. The common thread among all of them is that they require large amounts of computation and feature a level of interactivity that can only be created through computer technology.</p>
<p>While the World Wide Web and social media are already shaping our lives, and computer games are a major industry, other types of computational media are just beginning to emerge, according to Noah Wardrip-Fruin, an associate professor of computational media (formerly in computer science). "Here at UC Santa Cruz, for example, we're inventing technologies for deeply interactive storytelling, which can be used in games, but also for very different experiences," he said.</p>
<p>In 2012, UC Santa Cruz hosted <a href="http://mediasystems.soe.ucsc.edu">Media Systems</a>, a workshop on computational media sponsored by the National Science Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, Microsoft Studios, and Microsoft Research. With participation from a broad range of university and industry leaders, the workshop led to a report, '<a href="http://mediasystems.soe.ucsc.edu/report">Envisioning the Future of Computational Media</a>,' that was published in March of this year.</p>
<p>As an emerging discipline, computational media has not fit comfortably within traditional academic programs. In this respect, it is similar to another interdisciplinary field in which UC Santa Cruz has played a leadership role, namely bioinformatics, which combines biology and computer science. Many aspects of computational media are well beyond the concerns of computer science, yet it demands a level of technical engagement that does not fit well with more arts- or humanities-focused programs involving digital media.</p>
<p>Design and technology are deeply intermeshed in computational media, as seen in the pioneering work of the department's founding faculty in areas such as human-computer interaction, interactive storytelling, natural language dialog, and procedural content generation. In addition to Mateas and Wardrip-Fruin, faculty in the new department include Arnav Jhala, Sri Kurniawan, Marilyn Walker, and Jim Whitehead.</p>
<p>"We invent technologies for new kinds of playable simulations that enable new types of games that aren't possible today. We then design innovative new interactive experiences, which suggest new possibilities for technology research," Mateas said. "The training our students receive in this approach makes them highly competitive in the job market."</p>
<p>According to Mateas, colleagues at other institutions have responded enthusiastically to the idea of a computational media department. "They are interested in what we are doing here at UC Santa Cruz as a model for their own institutions," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0a706a85807270466b1f05a1e83e8c46"><name>gifford-gonzalez</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Diane Gifford-Gonzalez wins social sciences award for outstanding research</title><summary>Anthropology professor Diane Gifford-Gonzalez is the 2014 recipient of the Martin M.

Chemers Award for Outstanding Research in the Social Sciences at UC Santa Cruz. <br/><br/>Gifford-Gonzalez is one of the world&#8217;s leading practitioners of zooarchaeology, an archaeological science that analyzes animal remains to better understand human behavior.&#160; Zooarchaeology is &#8220;not just stuff you dig up,&#8221; Gifford-Gonzalez says. &#8220;It is how we imagine these past worlds to push the scientific envelope.&#8221;<br/><br/>As a pioneer in her field, Gifford-Gonzalez has developed methodological practices that have influenced ways archaeologists conduct research. <br/><br/>&#8220;My research recognizes the agency of animals and plants," she said. "They make demands on humans too. Archaeology is as much a craft as it is a science and discipline. It is about imagination. It&#8217;s about really understanding that organism. <br/><br/>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the things," she adds. "It&#8217;s the patterns in mass data that emerge. That&#8217;s what is exciting.&#8221;<br/><br/>Gifford-Gonzalez points out that most historical science is analogical, where the past is understood through a present perspective. By making anachronistic comparisons, research becomes unreliable.

What have we learned about earthquakes since then? </article-subhead><article-text><p>On October 17, 1989, at 5:04 p.m., Susan Schwartz was jogging with a colleague on a field at UC Santa Cruz when the Earth began to shudder and the ground slipped beneath them.</p>
<p>Schwartz, a postdoctoral fellow at the time, could barely stand. The initial 6.9 magnitude quake was over in 15 seconds. That quarter-minute was enough to make the Cypress Street Viaduct on the Nimitz Freeway tumble in Oakland, smashing cars and killing 42 people. A section of the Pacific Garden Mall in Santa Cruz collapsed, crushing three people.</p>
<p>When the shaking stopped, 63 people were dead already or mortally injured, nearly 4,000 were hurt, and thousands were left without homes. But Schwartz, of course, had no way of knowing all this. She only knew that "something very significant" had happened.</p>
<p>She saw a few frightened people sitting on the ground feeling aftershocks near the Earth and Marine Sciences Building; books scattered over floors; and people gathered around battery-powered radios relaying distorted reports of the devastation: The whole Bay Bridge had collapsed. People were out in the water.</p>
<p>"And, of course, part of the bridge did collapse, but the initial transmissions were a little bit exaggerated," Schwartz recalled. Then she took a walk on campus, looked out at downtown Santa Cruz, and saw the smoke of fires from broken gas mains.</p>
<p>The Loma Prieta quake&#8212;25 years ago this month&#8212;has become a touchstone in modern Central Coast history, a dividing line between "before" and "after" in the memories of long-time Santa Cruzans who remember the tragic deaths, the demolition of beloved landmarks like the Cooper House, and the dramatically altered look of downtown, including the reconfigured "Pacific Garden Mall."</p>
<p>But it's also a touchstone in the history of seismology. This year, three UC Santa Cruz seismologists&#8212;Schwartz, along with Thorne Lay and Emily Brodsky&#8212;looked back on that frightening time and reflected on just how far earthquake studies have come since then, while considering the work that must be done before scientists can more reliably predict quakes and prepare Californians for "the big one."</p>
<p>And make no mistake, these scientists say&#8212;a big one is coming.</p>
<p>When he looks at recent California history, Lay senses a quake "deficiency," and has a strong concern that "faults have been building up strain for a long time. We are due for an earthquake. Judging from the rates that plates are moving and faults are deforming, there is a 60-80 percent probability of a magnitude 7 quake around the Bay Area in the next 25-30 years."</p>
<p>The quake that rumbled through Napa in the early hours of August 24 was a stark reminder that the Bay Area rests on a landscape with underground plates "grinding steadily along," said Lay. "These little snaps and pops are part of the expected behavior of the fault system."</p>
<p>He said scientists simply don't have any way of knowing how a relatively minor quake such as the one in Napa would have any bearing on the "big one" that is bound to come.</p>
<p>And while he noted the "substantial impact," Lay said that it was "nowhere near the largest that are likely to happen in the area."</p>
<p>Lay says the East Bay and the San Francisco Peninsula are more likely candidates for quakes than Santa Cruz in the near future. But it would be "silly," he said, for any Northern Californian not to be prepared.</p>
<p>The outcome of the Napa quake&#8212;which caused $1 billion in damages but no fatalities&#8212;gave him some hope that Northern California has been learning from past experience. If a comparable quake had happened in China, he said, hundreds would have been killed.</p>
<h3>Sea change</h3>
<p>Of the current seismologists at UC Santa Cruz, Schwartz was the only one on campus at the time.</p>
<p>Brodsky was still a high school student in New York, watching the World Series that day&#8212;the San Francisco Giants vs. the Oakland Athletics at Candlestick Park. Suddenly the picture cut out.</p>
<p>Lay was a seismology professor at the University of Michigan, where ice storms posed a much more pressing concern than underground temblors. He had already been hired by UC Santa Cruz and was preparing to take the job. After the quake, he flew out to California, where he joined an ongoing aftershock study and headed out into the mountains.</p>
<p>This was his first encounter with a quake's devastating aftermath. The damage and loss of lives were modest compared with the huge quakes that have struck other parts of the world more recently, such as the 20,000 fatalities from the Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011 and quarter million fatalities in the Sumatra quake and ensuing tsunami of 2004. Still, Loma Prieta exposed the area's vulnerability. Bottled water supplies ran out quickly at local supermarkets. Those who had not saved fuel soon experienced shortages.</p>
<p>"The net impact was huge," Lay said. He also noted that there is still a vacant lot downtown where a building was destroyed and has yet to be rebuilt, saying, "there was a multi-decade effect on the economy."</p>
<p>Santa Cruz was forced to reckon with the fact that downtown structures are built on a weak riverbed and vulnerable to strong shaking, Lay said. "The impact was &#8230;filled with lessons on how to implement wise decisions in land use, and do very good engineering and prepare for the inevitability of quakes."</p>
<h3>A great leap forward</h3>
<p>Earthquake studies were not quite in the "dark ages" at the time, "but it almost felt like a cottage industry," Lay said.</p>
<p>Scientists had embraced digital quake-recording technology, leaving behind old analog earthquake- recording devices that used rolls of paper, needles, ink, and rotating metal "drums." But retrieving data was still frustrating and cumbersome.</p>
<p>"You had to dial in with modems to a few individual stations," Lay said. If the Loma Prieta quake happened today, the information would be available almost instantly to a global research community with 1,500 research stations worldwide.</p>
<p>The art and science of earthquake analysis has also changed a good deal since then&#8212;and UC Santa Cruz has been part of that leap forward.</p>
<p>Lay specializes in integrating seismic, GPS, and tsunami data. Schwartz uses high-tech portable equipment to study areas that have both volcanoes and quakes like Costa Rica and northern New Zealand, while trying to understand the diversity of slips that occur on faults.</p>
<p>Brodsky and her team have drilled directly into the fault that caused the Tohoku quake in Japan, taking its temperature to gauge friction heat generated during the fault slippage. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation funded this work in 2012, with a grant of more than $750,000. She has worked on a diversity of topics including the long-range triggering interactions of various quakes.</p>
<p>"Because of the way seismic waves travel, they sometimes trigger other earthquakes," Brodsky said."If you have sensitive enough instrumentation you start to see these small signals as an important part of the system."</p>
<p>Even small quakes can influence other quakes."They are always talking to each other," she said.</p>
<p>And Brodsky is among the scientists who study the effects of shaking on groundwater systems, and how fracking and hydrothermal activities can trigger earthquakes.</p>
<p>The notion that earthquakes are always "acts of God'' becomes woefully outdated when seismologists consider the various ways that water, being pumped in and out of the ground, can affect the slippage along a fault.</p>
<p>Brodsky pointed out that significant fracking and hydrothermal activity is going on right here in California."People make quakes all the time,"she said.</p>
<p>Schwartz attributed some of this impressive progress to advances in computer capabilities, including simulated seismic waves shaking the Earth. She also noted that GPS sensors placed on either side of a quake fault can give scientists a better sense of strain along the fault.</p>
<p>"That still won't tell us when it is going to occur," she said, "but it does give us a better sense of where most of the slip (along the quake fault) will happen."</p>
<p>Aside from their groundbreaking research, all three of these professors have found ways to communicate their findings in an accessible manner to students, community members, and reporters. Brodsky, for instance, is well-known for using everything from whole-wheat matzo crackers to bricks and bungee ropes to demonstrate the mechanics of the Earth's crust breaking, and the build-up of strain along a fault.</p>
<p>In the process, through intensive research as well as teaching, these professors have helped increase the baseline understanding of quakes worldwide.</p>
<p>"We don't do a lot of quake prediction, " Schwartz said, referring to UC Santa Cruz faculty, "but to improve quake prediction you must improve the base of understanding&#8212;and we have made a very large impact on understanding the basic physics of quakes."</p>
<h3>Bracing for 'the big one'</h3>
<p>While scientists have made great strides in understanding quakes, and at least have a better grasp of when a quake might happen and which faults are active, reliable quake prediction is still a long way away. This is not to say we have no capability of predicting quakes. Scientists have been able to determine the likelihood in a broad sense&#8212;usually over a span of 10 years or more&#8212;while closing in on certain sections of certain faults that are likely to slip in a given time period.</p>
<p>Since 1989, scientists have pioneered the use of GPS sensors to be placed on either side of a fault and tracked every day, showing them how the rock is slowly deforming, straining, bending to a breaking point.</p>
<p>The trouble is, there is some elusive transition that occurs right before a fault fails. Lay likened it to that unpredictable moment when a child stretches a rubber band and builds tension, and then it breaks without warning.</p>
<p>"There is no smoking gun that works for all earthquakes all the time,'' he said. "There are indications of precursory phenomena&#8212;but it's anecdotal at this point."</p>
<p>"Seismology is still a young field," Schwartz said. "We're still learning some fundamental things about the behavior of rocks under certain conditions. Every piece of information we obtain will help us predict, in some sense, but it is a very complicated system."</p>
<p>Even in the absence of pinpoint- accurate predictability, Californians can still plan ahead. Every quake along every major fault guides good engineering practices to "harden" the built environment. "This has proven quite successful," Lay noted. "The total loss of life in the 1989 quake and in the Northridge quake of 1994 has been relatively small."</p>
<p>Still, he said that many structures in California are still not retrofitted, which troubles him, especially considering that some active faults have yet to be discovered. "Sometimes we first learn about faults when they first rupture," he said. "Northridge was a fault that was not previously recognized (prior to the earthquake)."</p>
<p>Lay is also concerned that life lessons from Loma Prieta are "starting to get pretty far away" from local memory, in part because "a whole new generation of people has never run into how frustrating it is to go four or five days without fresh water, and you can't function normally or drive because the roads are messed up.</p>
<p>"We need to remind people to take advantage of this anniversary," he continued. "There are practical measures that are not too expensive but pay off a big benefit eventually."</p>
<p>Among those measures: understanding how to shut off the gas at your house, how to turn off the water to avoid contamination, stocking up on fresh water and fuel.</p>
<p>After all, he said, "this is not going away. It is endemic. There will be another big earthquake."</p>

She was named one of Forbes&#8217;s &#8220;Top 12 Women in Gaming to Watch&#8221; in 2013. <br/><br/>"Robin Hunicke is fabulous,&#8221; said Jennifer Parker, Chair of the UC Santa Cruz Art Department.&#160;&#8220;She is a huge supporter of independent game development and an advocate of women and minorities within the games industry.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;Her vision to expand the arts to include games will enable a focus on experience design that partners well with the current <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Games and Playable Media</strong></em></a> program on campus,&#8221; Parker added, &#8220;while also establishing a new place for Games as Art--bringing together original and unique ways of knowing and experiencing the world through engaged play.&#8221;<br/><br/>Hunicke was recruited to join Electronic Arts in 2005, where she worked on The Sims2, MySims, and Steven Spielberg&#8217;s Boom Blox series for the Wii. In 2009, she joined the independent game studio, thatgamecompany, as executive producer for the award-winning Playstation Network title Journey.<br/><br/>"I have admired Robin's work for many years, so having her join the faculty is a dream come true,&#8221; said Jim Whitehead, UC Santa Cruz Professor of Computational Media. &#8220;Her blend of deep design and technical background is extremely rare, and I'm excited she will be bringing this knowledge to our students."<br/><br/>Hunicke co-organizes the Experimental Gameplay Workshop at the Game Developers Conference, the largest annual gathering of professional video game developers. She has chaired the IndieCade Festival of Indpendent Games, and has published and lectured extensively on the &#8220;Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics&#8221; model of game design. <br/><br/>An evangelist for diversity of thought and participation in game design and game culture, Hunicke was honored last year for her role as an ambassador for women at Microsoft&#8217;s annual Women in Gaming Awards. <br/><br/>"Robin has been doing amazing work creating games that break new ground in emotional and aesthetic experience,&#8221; noted Michael Mateas, director of the <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu"><em><strong>Center for Games and Playable Media</strong></em></a>. &#8220;She's also been a fearless champion of sustainable development and broadening participation in the games industry.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;We're thrilled to have someone join us whose values are in such alignment with Games and Playable Media at UC Santa Cruz," he added.<br/><br/>&#160;&#160;

Bailey has been an active member of the Arboretum community since joining the Board of the Friends of the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum in 2012.</p>
<p>The executive administrator position at the Arboretum was last held by Dan Harder in 2009, and since then Brett Hall has served as director. With Bailey's appointment, Hall has been named director of collections and conservation, enabling him to focus his full attention on the Arboretum's plant collections and education programs.</p>
<p>Bailey has extensive experience in nonprofit administration, organizational development, and fundraising. She has worked at UC Santa Cruz for over nine years and served as assistant vice provost of undergraduate education for five years.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to have Jessica in this role," said Herbert Lee, vice provost for academic affairs. "She brings experience with nonprofit leadership to complement the existing wealth of botanical expertise at the Arboretum. She is in a great position to deepen connections between the Arboretum and the local community, as well as the Arboretum and the campus."</p>
<p>The focus of Bailey's efforts at the Arboretum will be on the sustainability of the collections, fundraising and financial stability, and enhancing the visitor experience.</p>
<p>"We have a stellar staff at the Arboretum, with recognized expertise and longstanding relationships with community members. My role will complement the staff and relieve them of some of the administrative and management responsibilities so that they can focus on their real passions," Bailey said.</p>
<p>One of her goals, she said, is to raise awareness in the community of the Arboretum's world-class collections and its important contributions to plant conservation and endangered species management. The UC Santa Cruz Arboretum serves both the campus and the public with its rich and diverse collection of plants from around the world. It has research and teaching facilities and maintains collections of rare and threatened plants of unusual scientific interest.</p>
<p>The Arboretum's collections include large assemblages of plants from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as California natives. Many of the species in these collections are not otherwise available for study in American botanical gardens. The Arboretum is also involved in importing, selecting, and breeding ornamental plants, especially those that are drought tolerant and pest resistant, and has introduced many choice ornamentals to the nursery trade.</p>
<p>"We have a world-renowned collection, and we're doing good work in conservation and education. The campus has invested in this gem because it sees the value of that work and its relevance to the broader mission of the university," Bailey said.</p>
<p>Bailey has a masters of public administration from the University of Southern California and a B.A. in political science from UCLA. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz, she was a consultant to nonprofits and courts, a coordinator for judicial education programs, and a fundraiser for the Point Reyes Bird Observatory.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="10bc2a60807270466b1f05a154e748bb"><name>rev-fall-14-from-the-chancellor</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>From the chancellor: Approaching a milestone</title><summary>When I walked onto the UC Santa Cruz campus as a young assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics in 1972, I had no idea I'd be here for the next 42 years.

<p>I was only in my 20s. The campus was just seven years old&#8212;no one was thinking of its 50th anniversary. Yet here I am, and here we are. Next year&#8212;2015&#8212;marks our 50th year, a major milestone for UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Looking at old photos brings back so many memories. I've uploaded a few to the UC Santa Cruz timeline, a great interactive "scrapbook" created as part of our 50th anniversary celebration. See if you recognize the tall, bearded professor&#8212;and then submit your own photos at <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/timeline">50years.ucsc.edu/timeline</a>.</p>
<p>For me, it's been an amazing ride. I joined the campus in its relative infancy, drawn to an already strong Astronomy Department and attracted by UC Santa Cruz's youth and spirit of daring.</p>
<p>There have been bumps along the way, but let's face it: Nothing worth doing goes smoothly for 50 years! And our setbacks are vastly outnumbered by our successes: From the Earth to the heavens&#8212;literally, sustainable agriculture to astrophysics&#8212; UC Santa Cruz has had an outsized impact during its first 50 years.</p>
<p>We won the race to assemble the first map of the human genome&#8212; and then we put it online, ensuring that this amazing resource would be available to the world&#8212;<i>for free, forever.</i></p>
<p>The Marine Mammal Protection Act has its roots here, in the work of beloved researcher and teacher Ken Norris, who helped write the legislation in 1972. Today, faculty, students, and alumni are building on Ken's legacy with their contributions to California's sweeping coastal protection network.</p>
<p>Our researchers are investigating novel approaches to treating cancer and protecting the environment. Our artists and historians are shedding new light on the civil rights movement, creating interactive works to engage the public on environmental issues, and much more.</p>
<p>And for nearly 50 years, our graduates have been making their marks on the world: authoring bestselling novels, writing Pulitzer Prizewinning expos&#233;s, directing pathbreaking films and television series, advocating for the less fortunate, launching innovative businesses, and opening the eyes of students of all ages.</p>
<p>There's something about UC Santa Cruz&#8212;the physical setting, the creative blending of the disciplines, the encouragement of free thought and questioning authority&#8212;that nurtures the best in each of us.</p>
<p>There is no place I'd rather be than right here at UC Santa Cruz, on the cusp of a momentous year.</p>

"It gets in your head."<br/><br/>Kelly Weisberg, professor at UC Hastings School of Law and founder of the new 3+3 law program at UC Santa Cruz, introduced Perry, saying she &#8220;epitomizes the commitment to social justice that is a founding value of UC Santa Cruz. Her legal case is a landmark decision in the gay rights movement.&#8221; <br/><br/>In 2008, Perry was working with celebrity activist Rob Reiner at First 5 California, a state agency he helped create dedicated to child health development. Reiner asked if she and Stier would be interested in joining lawyers Ted Olson and David Boies and fellow plaintiffs to sue the very government she worked for.<br/><br/>In 2010, a federal judge ruled Proposition 8 was unconstitutional. His decision was upheld, first by a federal appeals court, and later by the U.S. Supreme Court. <br/><br/>Perry has had prominent career in the child advocacy and policy field. In 2012, she was appointed executive director of the First Fives Years Fund, a bipartisan advocacy group devoted to early childhood education for disadvantaged children. Perry and Stier married for the third legal time in June 2013. Perry and Stier currently live in Washington, D.C. and have four sons.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/santacruz/ci_26721630</url><title>Santa Cruz Sentinel article</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/perry-recap.html</url><title>Social Sciences Division article</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1a2c3df1807270466b1f05a129ca7843"><name>icebound-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grad students' interactive fiction honored at IndieCade games festival</title><summary>Ice-Bound is an interactive fiction piece created by two graduate students in the UC Santa Cruz Center for Games and Playable Media</summary><keywords>Aaron Reed, Jacob Garbe, Ice-Bound, computer game design, Games and Playable Media, Center for Games and Playable Media, Computational Media</keywords><start-date>1413442800000</start-date><display-name>Grad students' interactive fiction honored at IndieCade games festival</display-name><path>/2014/10/icebound-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/icebound-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1413483347384</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414015208115</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/ice-bound-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/ice-bound-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ice-bound-400.jpg</name><display-name>ice-bound-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>94270</file-size><width>400</width><height>352</height></image><image-alt>ice-bound web page image</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/ice-bound-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/ice-bound-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>ice-bound-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>ice-bound-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29013</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>IndieCade award image</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><i><a href="http://aaronareed.net/ice-bound/">Ice-Bound</a>,</i> an interactive fiction piece created by two graduate students in the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a>, has won the Story/World Design Award at the <a href="http://www.indiecade.com/2014/">2014 IndieCade International Festival of Independent Games</a>.</p>
<p>The IndieCade festival is a highly competitive and influential venue for independently made computer games, according to Jim Whitehead, professor of computational media at UC Santa Cruz. The Story/World Design Award honors the special craft of revealing narratives through interactions within an imagined world which players want to inhabit and explore.</p>
<p><i>Ice-Bound</i> combines interactive digital technology with a printed art book to create a new kind of story involving doomed polar explorers and a self-doubting artificial intelligence (AI). Its creators, <a href="http://aaronareed.net/">Aaron Reed</a> and <a href="http://www.jacobgarbe.com/">Jacob Garbe</a>, are both graduates of the Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. program and are currently working toward Ph.D. degrees in computer science in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"<i>Ice-Bound</i> is a new kind of interactive narrative where a dynamic, evolving story on an iPad can be altered using a physical book," Reed said.</p>
<p>The premise of the story involves an author's unfinished masterpiece about a mysterious polar research station, and a digital simulation of the dead author created by his publishing company to finish the novel. "Through interacting with this AI doppelganger, you get to rearrange different stories and see how they fit together, and even how they end," Garbe said.</p>
<p>Reed and Garbe have launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1850151847/ice-bound-a-novel-of-reconfiguration">Kickstarter campaign</a> to help pay for a high-quality print run for the book portion of the project. The interactions between the physical art book and the digital app are essential to the story. The app, using the iPad's built-in camera (or a PC with webcam), recognizes the pages of the book and can change them in front of the reader using augmented reality.</p>
<p>"But showing the AI character pages of the book might change him too, and alter the course of his unfinished novel," Reed said. "And it's not just a gimmick. This two-way interaction between the physical and digital parts of the story is the central mechanic of the whole game."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/06/aaron-reed.html</url><title>UCSC graduate student is a new kind of storyteller</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1850151847/ice-bound-a-novel-of-reconfiguration</url><title>Ice-Bound Kickstarter site</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1f06256c807270466b1f05a10291bf81"><name>rev-fall-14-editors-note</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Editor's Note: Where were you?</title><summary>People often ask, "Where were you?" when something momentous and tragic happens—I guess it's a way to bond, grieve, and share.One such event occurred at 5:04 p.m. on October 17, 1989—25 years ago this month.</summary><keywords>Loma Prieta</keywords><start-date>1413529200000</start-date><display-name>Editor's Note: Where were you?</display-name><path>/2014/10/rev-fall-14-editors-note</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/rev-fall-14-editors-note</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1413564736831</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1413564736831</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Gwen Jourdonnais</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/editors-note.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/editors-note.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>editors-note.jpg</name><display-name>editors-note.jpg</display-name><file-size>8119</file-size><width>148</width><height>186</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Where were you?</p>
<p>It's a question people often ask each other when something momentous and tragic happens&#8212;I guess it's a way to bond, grieve, and share.</p>
<p>One such event occurred at 5:04 p.m. on October 17, 1989&#8212;25 years ago this month. The Loma Prieta earthquake shocked Santa Cruz County and the surrounding area, including the Bay Area and the San Francisco Peninsula. Sixty-three people died, thousands were injured, and several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures.</p>
<p>So &#8230; where were you? If you're old enough to remember (some of our younger readers weren't even born yet), the earthquake stays with you forever.</p>
<p>I was in a little house on College Avenue in Berkeley, where I lived with roommates while studying at UC Berkeley. A California kid, I'd been through many rounds of earthquake training in school. When the Earth shrugged, I dove under my desk. We were lucky&#8212;shaken but uninjured. In the next few hours and days, however, we would learn just how devastating the quake had been.</p>
<p>Earthquake knowledge and technology has come a long way since then&#8212;and UC Santa Cruz scientists have played a role in that advancement. Seismologists here, including Thorne Lay, Susan Schwartz, and Emily Brodsky, have been working to integrate data, understand the different types of slips that occur on faults, measure friction heat generated during fault slippage, and more. Their work has helped increase understanding of the basic physics of quakes&#8212;a first step toward better prediction of them.</p>
<p>As the campus looks both back and forward as it approaches its 50th birthday in 2015, it's these kinds of things&#8212;memories of the past, introspection on history, working to understand our environment and improve our future&#8212;that make me proud to be part of a place like this.</p>
<p>Maybe&#8212;just maybe&#8212;when the next "big one" is coming, we'll already know.</p>

<h3>Alumni advocacy</h3>

I think you may have missed an important alumni story with the short article on the $2 million gift from the Packard Foundation for Natural History Field Quarter and the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History (<i>Review</i> magazine, spring '14, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/rev-spring-14-campaign-update.html">Campaign Update</a>).
<p></p>
<p>This effort was spearheaded by an alumnus, <b>Larry Ford</b> (Kresge '77, environmental studies and biology). He was motivated to move forward with this proposal to the Packard Foundation because 500 UC Santa Cruz alumni, who had taken Ken's Natural History Field Quarter, showed up for a reunion during Alumni Weekend in 2012.</p>
<p>At that reunion, professor emeritus of environmental studies <b>Steve Gliessman,</b> who taught NHFQ, put a stuffed gopher in a terrarium and challenged folks who were attending to "bury the gopher" with checks and cash donations to continue the teaching of the Natural History Field Quarter. <b>Karen Holl,</b> the Environmental Studies Department chair at the time, also encouraged folks to give. That started the fundraising effort, and about $65,000 was raised between then and this spring.</p>
<p>It's a great story about the power of alumni to raise money for the things at UC Santa Cruz they're passionate about.</p>

Thank you for the UC Santa Cruz Instagram account! I am an alum living in frosty Ann Arbor, Mich., for the last decade or so. I really enjoy the photos when I check them each morning&#8212;whether it is Alumni Weekend and Sammy, or a quiet bench in the forest, or a close-up of some new flowers sprouting up on campus.
<p></p>
<p>I recently became a donor to the McHenry Library. My uncle&#8212;a fellow Banana Slug who graduated in the early 1980s&#8212;passed away, and I rounded up my family to make a gift to McHenry Library so we could create the "Robert Lindsay Hunt Memorial Pathway" as a tribute to a great man in our lives. The pathway is located south of McHenry Library between the stairs and the parking lot at the base of the hill.</p>
<p>Giving to UC Santa Cruz is a great way to pay tribute to fellow Slugs.</p>
<p>Choosing Santa Cruz for undergrad was one of the best choices in my entire life. Becoming a donor is a close second.</p>

Phenomenal undergraduate experience! The beauty of the campus is undeniable. The small class size and quality of instruction was wonderful. I also had the opportunity to work as a research assistant, which was invaluable preparation for graduate school. I love the opportunity to recommend UC Santa Cruz!

Hillman</article-subhead><article-text><p>Professor Elizabeth L. Hillman, a scholar and expert on sexual violence in the military, will speak Thursday, November 6, at UC Santa Cruz as part of the UC Hastings / UC Santa Cruz Social Justice Speakers Series (#UCsjss).</p>
<p>Her lecture, "Sworn to Protect: Sexual Assault in the Military," will begin at 7 p.m. at the Music Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus. The public is invited. The $5 admission includes parking. Tickets may be obtained at <a href="http://3plus3.ucsc.edu/sjss">http://3plus3.ucsc.edu/sjss</a>. A limited number of free student tickets are available at the UC Santa Cruz ticket office. <br/><br/>&#8220;Women in the military are more likely to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder because of rape by another service member than by combat,&#8221; says Hillman, provost and academic dean at UC Hastings College of Law. She has testified before Congress and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and is assisting lawmakers drafting bills proposing significant changes in military justice.<br/><br/>Few legal issues have sustained the political attention and cultural currency of sexual assault in the U.S. armed forces, Hillman says. Her presentation will address controversies that have erupted over the problem itself, which is often misunderstood; best practices and prospects for improving response systems to reports of sexual assault in both civilian and military arenas; and the unique nature of the American military justice system, which has been changed more in response to sexual assault than to any other crime, social problem, or disciplinary challenge since World War II.<br/><br/>Some of the questions she plans to address: "Should commanders control the decision to prosecute? Should each branch of service retain its own investigators, prosecutors, defense counsel, and appellate court? What's the impact of providing legal counsel to victims throughout the criminal justice process? What outcomes demonstrate improvement in preventing a crime that is so rarely reported?&#160; How do the gender demographics of the military affect sexual assault prevalence?"<br/><br/>Last year, the House Armed Services Committee&#8217;s ranking minority member appointed Hillman to an independent sexual assault review panel that will recommend policy changes to the U.S. Department of Defense.&#160; She began her scholarship about military sexual assault and civil rights in 2000 as a reporter for a blue-ribbon panel convened on the 50th anniversary of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<br/>&#160;<br/>In addition to her academic work, Hillman serves as president of the National Institute of Military Justice and as co&#8211;legal director of the Palm Center, an independent think tank that sponsored much of the critical empirical research that led to the end of &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s published two books: <em>Military Justice Cases and Materials</em>, with Eugene R. Fidell and Dwight H. Sullivan, and <em>Defending America: Military Culture and the Cold War Court-Martial</em>, and is working on a comparative study for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that will identify best practices for handling military sexual assault and harassment by examining what&#8217;s done in countries other than the United States.&#160; She&#8217;s also studying the military use of drones.</p>
<p>Hillman joined the Air Force ROTC to pay for college. She earned a degree in electrical engineering at Duke University before enlisting in the Air Force where she was a space operations officer and orbital analyst. After seven years, she left the military and became a scholar, earning her law degree as well as a Ph.D. in history, at Yale University.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, our topics find us,&#8221; she says about choosing what to research. &#8220;I try to keep talking to people&#8212;not just scholars but veterans, legal practitioners, judges, community groups, and gay and lesbian groups. It helps me get a sense of what people are concerned about and what we need to work on.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1fc6f112807270466b1f05a1abdaa8ab"><name>cosmic-map</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Astronomers create first 3-D map of the 'adolescent' universe </title><summary>Astronomers have created the first map of the ‘adolescent’ universe as it appeared 10.8 billion years ago. </summary><keywords>Xavier Prochaska, UC Observatories, Keck Observatory</keywords><start-date>1413442800000</start-date><display-name>Astronomers create first 3-D map of the 'adolescent' universe </display-name><path>/2014/10/cosmic-map</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/cosmic-map</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1413577371881</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1413578287860</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Hilary Lebow</name><title></title><phone/><email>lebow@ucolick.org</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/cosmic-map-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/cosmic-map-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cosmic-map-450.jpg</name><display-name>cosmic-map-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>48972</file-size><width>450</width><height>276</height></image><image-alt>map of cosmic web</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/cosmic-map-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/cosmic-map-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cosmic-map-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cosmic-map-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20297</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>cosmic map</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>This map of the cosmic web was generated from imprints of hydrogen gas observed in the spectrum of 24 background galaxies, which are located behind the volume being mapped.

From this imprint, astronomers can reconstruct which clouds the light has encountered as it traverses the "cosmic web" of dark matter and gas that accounts for the biggest structures in our universe. Image by Khee-Gan Lee (MPIA) and Casey Stark (UC Berkeley).</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>A team of astronomers including J. Xavier Prochaska, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, has created the first map of the &#8216;adolescent&#8217; universe as it appeared 10.8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>The three-dimensional map, which spans millions of light years across, provides a tantalizing glimpse into the large structures of the 'cosmic web', which form the backbone of the cosmic structure in the universe. Galaxies like our own Milky Way are embedded inside this cosmic web, and fill only a tiny fraction of its volume.</p>
<p>This is the first time the cosmic web has been mapped at such a large distance&#8212;a slice of the universe approximately 11 billion light years away. When astronomers observe to such immense distances, they are also looking back in time. With this glimpse into the past, the map reveals early stages of cosmic structure formation during an era when the galaxies were undergoing a major &#8216;growth spurt&#8217;.</p>
<p>According to Prochaska, the map will help astronomers understand how galaxies in the universe have evolved since the Big Bang occurred 13 billion years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the top level it&#8217;s a test of our current theory of cosmology. It shows us how the universe forms over cosmic time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With this terrific new technique, we have generated the first map of the universe&#8217;s matter only a few billion years after the Big Bang.&#8221;</p>
<p>The map was reconstructed by using the light of distant background galaxies passing through the cosmic web's hydrogen gas. This concept is similar to a medical CT scan, which reconstructs a three-dimensional image of the human body from the X-rays passing through a patient.</p>
<p>Prior to this research, using starlight from galaxies for this purpose was thought to be impossible &#8211; until Khee-Gan Lee from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy carried out calculations that suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>To create the map with this technique, Lee and his team observed galaxies on one of the largest telescopes in the world, the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</p>
<p>"I was surprised to find that existing large telescopes should already be able to collect sufficient light from these faint galaxies to map the foreground absorption, albeit at a lower resolution than would be feasible with future telescopes,&#8221; says Lee. &#8220;Still, this would provide an unprecedented view of the cosmic web which has never been mapped at such vast distances."</p>
<p>While trying to collect the data, Lee and his colleagues were plagued by a problem more terrestrial than cosmic &#8211; bad weather.</p>
<p>"We were pretty disappointed as the weather was terrible and we only managed to collect a few hours of good data. But judging by the data quality as it came off the telescope, it was already clear to me that the experiment was going to work," says astronomer Joseph Hennawi (MPIA), who was part of the observing team.</p>
<p>The data they collected was completely unprecedented, even with only four hours of observing time. They carried out absorption measurements using 24 faint background galaxies, which provided sufficient coverage of a small patch of the sky to be combined into a 3-D map of the foreground cosmic web.</p>
<p>Astronomers now hope to create an even larger map to glean further insights into the structure of the adolescent cosmic web and its function.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="208096c8807270466b1f05a13985f17a"><name>rev-fall-14-campaign-update</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campaign update  </title><summary>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz: Now at $180 million.</summary><keywords>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</keywords><start-date>1413529200000</start-date><display-name>Campaign update  </display-name><path>/2014/10/rev-fall-14-campaign-update</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/rev-fall-14-campaign-update</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1413589538460</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414686811167</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/larose-christopher.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/larose-christopher.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>larose-christopher.jpg</name><display-name>larose-christopher.jpg</display-name><file-size>14188</file-size><width>196</width><height>203</height></image><image-alt>Christopher LaRose, Farm apprentice program graduate, 2009 (photo by Elena Zhukova)</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><p>Christopher LaRose, Farm apprentice program graduate, 2009 (photo by Elena Zhukova)</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</article-subhead><article-text><p><strong>UC Santa Cruz had its biggest fundraising year on record in the past fiscal year, during which it publicly launched its first comprehensive fundraising campaign.</strong> Private giving to the campus topped $50 million for the year ending June 30, bringing the total raised in The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz to more than $180 million.

<h3>Nurturing sustainable agriculture</h3>
<p>A $4 million gift to UC Santa Cruz established an endowment to support the Farm and Garden apprenticeship, an internationally recognized program that provides training in the concepts and practices of organic gardening and small-scale farming.</p>
<p>The gift, from a donor who chooses to remain anonymous, will be used to ensure the long-term viability of the apprenticeship program and other related training programs at the UC Santa Cruz Farm and Alan Chadwick Garden, where the program is based.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship is one of the core programs of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), which has earned a reputation for the skill and knowledge of its instructors and researchers for more than four decades. Building resources for CASFS is a key goal of the Coastal Sustainability initiative in the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz. The initiative is a cross-disciplinary effort to restore and sustain the health of the coastal zone. Agricultural practices have major impacts on the health of oceans and marine life.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship blends the virtues of experiential learning with traditional classroom studies. It has trained more than 1,500 organic farmers. Topics covered during the six-month course include soil management, composting, pest control, crop planning, irrigation, farm equipment, marketing techniques, and Community Supported Agriculture practices.</p>
<p>The gift coincides with the launch of the <a href="rev-fall-14-food-for-thought.xml">UC Global Food Initiative</a>, which recognizes the unique ability of the University of California to play a leading role in addressing the challenges of nutrition and sustainability.</p>
<h3>Among other gifts</h3>
<p>A $1 million gift from alumna <a href="rev-fall-14-TIUCSC.xml">Julie Packard</a> (Crown '74, biology (BA), MA biology '78), executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, supports programs that help minority students excel in the sciences and mathematics. Says Packard: "I want to help ensure that underrepresented students in the sciences are able to enjoy the same opportunities at UC Santa Cruz that I did."</p>
<h3>Campaign progress</h3>
<p><strong>Now at $180 million&#160;</strong></p>
<p>The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz seeks to build resources across campus and in signature initiatives. Publicly launched in October 2013, its goal is to raise $300 million by the end of the campaign to enhance UC Santa Cruz's extraordinary educational environment, high-impact research, and enduring commitment to social and environmental responsibility.&#160;</p>

Some of the topics addressed include gender development and hormones, gender stereotyping in children, sexualization of girls and girlhood, single-sex versus coeducational schooling, norms of masculinity among boys and girls, and victimization of LGBTI youth.<br/><br/>Two researchers who received their Ph.D.s in development psychology from UC Santa Cruz will give presentations. Elizabeth Daniels, now at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, will take part in a panel on the sexualization of girls and girlhood. She'll be joined by UCSC psychology professor Eileen Zurbriggen, who has published widely on the subject. <br/><br/>Rachael Robnett, now at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, will be on a panel providing insights on gender development research from new investigators. Both Daniels and Robnett were graduate students at UCSC with Leaper, an internationally known expert on gender development. <br/><br/>Zurbriggen said it's unusual for a conference like this to be organized solely by a pair of interested faculty. Typically conferences are organized by professional societies, that have staff for event planning. "I think this exemplifies some of what is special about UCSC," Zurbriggen said. <br/><br/>"Not only do our faculty do world-class research themselves but are also dedicated to teaching and service&#8211;in this case, providing outstanding mentoring and networking opportunities for graduate students, and serving the field by providing a space for intense intellectual discussions among an interdisciplinary group of researchers.&#160; And they do it year after year." <br/><br/>It's also a place for graduate students to interact with senior scholars, and provides networking opportunities at lunches and other events, she said. Several UC Santa Cruz psychology graduate students are presenting posters at the conference. <br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://gender.ucsc.edu/index.html</url><title>Conference web page</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2f166bc8807270466b1f05a11fc5bc54"><name>brant-keynote</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A campaign to support our dreams</title><summary>By Keith Brant, Vice Chancellor, University Relations — A year ago this week, we launched the public phase of The Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, the first comprehensive effort to raise the stakes in private support for the campus.

The first year was a rousing success. In the fiscal year ending in June, the campus raised a record $50 million in new gifts, pledges, and planned gifts, pushing the campaign total past the $180 million mark and closer to the $300 million goal.&#160; This alone is an occasion to celebrate!<br/><br/>But, as much as we think and talk in terms of dollars raised, a campaign is about far more than just fundraising.&#160; In fact, the dollars are short-term milestones on the way toward accomplishing a number of long-term goals.<br/><br/>First, this campaign is about dreaming. It&#8217;s about developing our collective vision for the future: Who we want to be, what we want to offer, what we want to look like, and, then finding the resources that support our vision. The popular 20th Century poet William Arthur Ward wrote, &#8220;If you can imagine it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it, you can become it.&#8221; The interdisciplinary Institute of the Arts and Sciences is a great example of a new vision. Our challenge is to find investors who believe in our dreams, too.<br/><br/>Second, this campaign is about telling our stories. The Santa Cruz stories live in our passion to understand and protect the earth, the seas, and the sky as manifest through such studies as marine conservation, agroecology, seismology, water research, coastal sustainability and astrophysics. We decode and organize data to improve lives through the study of genomics, data science, gaming, digital media and robotics. We embrace the liberal arts as a means to understand the meaning of life and creatively express our being.&#160; UC Santa Cruz stories are ones built on courage&#8212;the courage to be different, to challenge the status quo, and dare to make the world a better place <br/><br/>Our dreams and our stories are useless unless they are heard. Therefore, our campaign must be about engaging people, bending their ears and helping them to understand how we are unique and worthy. In this campaign, we seek to expand our reach so that more alumni and more friends of the campus will hear our call. Our upcoming 50th Anniversary will serve as a catalyst for people to take notice. Across campus, faculty, staff, and students are developing plans to make 2015 an unforgettably rewarding and intellectually stimulating year.<br/><br/>Finally, this campaign is about sustained efficacy and getting better at what we do. As we find more ways to tell our stories, more people will hear them, more people will engage in the life of the campus, and more people will support our dreams.<br/><br/>Everybody can participate in this campaign--by dreaming a great future for the campus, carefully crafting the stories they tell, and reaching out and welcoming others to experience UC Santa Cruz. &#160;<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2fef0ab5807270466b1f05a118a78c53"><name>rev-fall-14-road-to-65</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Preparing for UC Santa Cruz's 50th  </title><summary>This fifth installment in our series of stories leading up to a celebration of UC Santa Cruz's 50th anniversary in 2015 is about Page Smith, the first provost of Cowell College, whose unconventional approach set the tone for a rigorous and free-flowing education. </summary><keywords>Page Smith</keywords><start-date>1413788400000</start-date><display-name>Preparing for UC Santa Cruz's 50th  </display-name><path>/2014/10/rev-fall-14-road-to-65</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/rev-fall-14-road-to-65</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1413848435317</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1413848435317</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/smith-page-1.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/smith-page-1.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>smith-page-1.jpg</name><display-name>smith-page-1.jpg</display-name><file-size>123788</file-size><width>300</width><height>404</height></image><image-alt>Page Smith came to UC Santa Cruz to "shake up what he saw as a boring, factory-like system</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/smith-page-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/smith-page-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>smith-page-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>smith-page-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>29446</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Page Smith came to UC Santa Cruz to "shake up what he saw as a boring, factory-like system</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Page Smith came to UC Santa Cruz to "shake up what he saw as a boring, factory-like system of education."&#160;(Photo by Eric Thiermann)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/smith-page-2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/smith-page-2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>smith-page-2.jpg</name><display-name>smith-page-2.jpg</display-name><file-size>123517</file-size><width>300</width><height>435</height></image><image-alt>Smith assisting new students in registering on opening day, 1965.

<p>In 1964, Page Smith walked onto the fledgling UC Santa Cruz campus, his slight limp a reminder of the wounds he suffered when he tripped a stake mine in Italy as an Army captain during WWII.</p>
<p>He was a tall man with a face that lay on the border between rugged and distinguished, a Maryland-born historian whose two-volume biography of John Adams had recently won a Bancroft Prize. But Smith, then 47, wasn't at the new campus to enhance his rising reputation. Instead, the former UCLA professor and newly hired first provost of Cowell College had come to shake up what he saw as a boring, factory-like system of education.</p>
<p>In the next five years, the Harvard-educated Smith would do just that. He would not only help hire a fiery collection of thought-provoking pioneer faculty but would lead the charge to dump letter grades in favor of narrative evaluations, set a model for the campus's core courses, and bring a heady mix of artists, activists, and thinkers to campus to teach and mingle with students.</p>
<p>The man who sometimes fired a musket during his history classes and wrote books on subjects as diverse as Thomas Jefferson and the importance of chickens saw UC Santa Cruz as an opportunity to innovate, to make learning exciting again.</p>
<p>"What Page and (his wife) Eloise started together was the idea that you educate the whole person," said Faye Crosby, current Cowell College provost. "You don't drive into the big parking lot of knowledge, fill up your brain, and drive away. You are part of an intellectual community. You are in the pursuit of truth in the company of friends."</p>
<p>Stories about Smith's early years at UC Santa Cruz abound: The white horse he rode around campus, the letter he wrote taking students to task for going barefoot, wearing raunchy clothes, and having too much sex&#8212;a missive that became the subject of a <i>TIME</i> magazine article.</p>
<p>But it was Smith's progressive ideas about the nature of a rigorous and free-flowing education and his love for students that became legend at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>It was Smith who set up weekly College Nights where faculty and students attended a formal dinner followed by mind-blowing speakers like the radical Harvard theologian Harvey Cox, writer/activist Susan Sontag, and neurologist Oliver Sacks. It was Smith who invited artists like Noah Purifoy, co-founder of the Watts Towers Art Center, and Ruth Asawa, a Japanese-American sculptress and activist, to lead seminars on campus. And it was Smith who conceived Cowell's two-year World Civilization core course, taught by Professors William Hitchcock and Mary Holmes.</p>
<p>He nettled the UC system by leading the charge to get rid of letter grades which, according to his posthumously published oral history, he thought, "produced a competitive situation where some people prospered at the expense of others," and he also rankled some for his admittedly "wretched" administrative style that left people waiting at his messy desk while he wandered the campus talking to students and faculty about campus needs.</p>
<p>But what many from the pioneer years at UC Santa Cruz remember most was the way he and his artistwife, Eloise, threw open their doors and hearts to the UC Santa Cruz community&#8212;counseling students through personal problems, inviting them into their home, and making it a point to learn about each student's interests and dreams.</p>
<p>"No matter who you were, no matter what your background," said Bill Dickinson (Cowell '68, philosophy), "they behaved as though you had nobility in you. And they made it abundantly clear that they, and the college community, stood ready to draw it out."</p>
<p>Smith, who believed the first five or six years of a new venture were the most ripe for change, left the provost's post in 1969 but continued to teach. In 1973, he resigned in protest of a decision to deny tenure to his friend and colleague, Assistant Professor of Religious Studies Paul Lee&#8212;a decision he saw as putting publishing above the important talent of teaching students.</p>
<p>Smith retired with his beloved Eloise to his Bonny Doon ranch where he wrote eight more books, including the eight-volume A People's History of the United States, pursued social justice issues, and raised a menagerie of farm animals, including a flock of 100 chickens.</p>
<p>Smith died of leukemia on Aug. 28, 1995&#8212;thirty-six hours after Eloise succumbed to kidney cancer. He was 77. "When mother died, he (Smith) was having chemotherapy," his daughter Anne Easley recalled. "He just pulled the lines out right there." By the next afternoon, he was in a coma and, surrounded by family, he died that night.</p>
<p>"One of the last things he said was, 'Give my best to everyone at Cowell,'" Easley said.&#160;</p>

Since December 2004 there have been no less than 18 quakes of magnitude 8.0 or greater--a rate of more than twice that seen from 1900 to mid-2004. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost and massive damage has resulted from these great earthquakes. But as devastating as such events can be, these recent great quakes have come with a silver lining: They coincide with unprecedented advances in technological and scientific capacity for learning from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We previously had very limited information about how ruptures grow into great earthquakes and interact with regions around them,&#8221; said seismologist Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;So we are using the recorded data for these recent events to guide our understanding of future earthquakes. We've gained a new level of appreciation for how one earthquake can influence events in other zones.&#8221;</p>
<p>High on the list of areas ripe for a great quake is Cascadia, the Pacific Northwest, where the risk for great quakes had long been under appreciated. Evidence began surfacing about 20 years ago that there had been a great quake in the region in the year 1700. Since then the view of the great quake risk in Cascadia has shifted dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don't know many details about what happened in 1700,&#8221; said Lay. There were no instruments back then to observe and record it. And so the best way to try and understand the danger and what could happen in Cascadia is to study the recent events elsewhere.</p>
<p>Over the last decade Lay and his colleagues have been able to gather fine details about these giant earthquakes using data from an expanded global network of seismometers, GPS stations, tsunami gauges, and new satellite imaging capabilities such as GRACE, InSAR, and LandSAT interferometry. Among the broader conclusions they have come to is that great quakes are very complicated and idiosyncratic. Lay presented some of those findings at the meeting of the Geological Society of America in Vancouver on October 21.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we've seen is that we can have multiple faults activated,&#8221; said Lay. &#8220;We've seen it off Sumatra and off Japan. Once earthquakes get going they can activate faulting in areas that were thought not physically feasible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 26, 2004, for instance, unzipped a 1,300 kilometer long segment of the subduction zone and unleashed one of history's most destructive, deadly tsunamis. Much of the rupture was along a region with very limited plate convergence. In Japan, the Kuril Islands, and the Solomon Islands, great mega-thrust ruptures have ruptured portions of the subduction zones that were thought too warm or weak to experience earthquakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;These earthquakes ruptured right through areas that had been considered to have low risk,&#8221; said Lay. &#8220;We thought that would not happen. But it did, so we have to adjust our understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the best recent analogy to Cascadia is off the coast of Iquique, Chile, said Lay. There had been a great quake in 1877, and a conspicuous gap in quakes ever since. Like the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, there is little data for the 1877 event, which killed more than 2,500 people. In both subduction zones, the converging plates are thought to be accumulating strain which could be released in a very large and violent rupture. On April 1 of this year, some of that strain was released offshore of Iquique. There was a magnitude 8.1 rupture in the northern portion of the seismic gap. But it involved slip over less than 20 percent of the region that seismologists believe to have accumulated strain since 1877.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no idea why only a portion of the 1877 zone ruptured,&#8221; said Lay. &#8220;But clearly, 80 percent of that zone is still unruptured. We don't have a good basis for assessment of how the rest will fail. It&#8217;s the same for Cascadia. We don't know if it always goes all at once or sometimes in sequences of smaller events, with alternating pattern. It is prudent to prepare for the worst case of failure of the entire region in a single event, but it may not happen that way every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is certain is that studying these recent big earthquakes has given geophysicists the best information ever about how they work and point to new ways to begin understanding what could be in Cascadia's future.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/08/griggs-cascadia.html</url><title>Old evidence leads to new ideas about earthquake hazards in Pacific Northwest</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3505f2fd807270466b1f05a15f97aa0c"><name>rev-fall-14-its-a-party</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2015—It's a party!

He was shocked to find that the amphitheater was closed in 2006 due to its deteriorated state.</p>
<p>"It's such a beautiful spot, and kind of hidden, and I just felt sad that it had fallen into disrepair,'' said Hancock, managing principal of the California Appellate Law Group in San Francisco. "I remember hearing someone play guitar there. The acoustics were beautiful. My sister acted there in a play by Euripides."</p>
<p>Hancock's gift to UC Santa Cruz kicked off fundraising efforts to renovate the amphitheater. The project is in the early phase, but a recent campus survey got a tremendous response from UC Santa Cruz students. The Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC) has been consulted about this project and is poised to advise campus leadership on the use of student services fees and seismic fees to help return the amphitheater to its former glory and once again become a world-class performance space.</p>
<p>Reopening the Quarry Amphitheater is among the priorities of the Campaign for UC Santa Cruz, a $300 million fundraising effort to provide critical resources to the campus.</p>
<p>Hancock and a group of volunteers hope that fellow alumni will participate in the Quarry's revitalization, partnering with students to give new life to the iconic space and provide an essential UC Santa Cruz student experience.</p>
<p>"I've talked with many people who, like Bill Hancock, have fond memories of the Quarry," said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway. "I hope this will be an appealing project, especially to our alumni."</p>
<p>Built in 1967 at a cost of $82,000, the Quarry has a storied history.</p>
<p>Even before it was finished, UC Santa Cruz's founding chancellor, Dean McHenry, held his 1966 inauguration there. Congresswoman Bella Abzug, author and architect Buckminster Fuller, and political activist Angela Davis have spoken there. The amphitheater once played host to a presidential stump speech by Gov. Jerry Brown and a teach-in featuring former U.S. ambassador Joe Wilson.</p>
<p>The venue has been sorely missed. An eclectic mix of student groups has been searching for places to gather and showcase their talent, said student Max Hufft ('15 Crown, computer engineering), former SFAC voting member and commissioner of academic affairs for SUA. "We're seeing a really high demand for performance and meeting spaces," he said.</p>
<p>Work on the architectural design concepts began in October of this year. Initial construction is anticipated to begin in spring 2016, and would address basic improvements including earthquake safety, accessibility, Wi-Fi, new seating, and lighting in the aisles.</p>
<p>In a future phase(s), the plan proposes installation of a "smart stage," which could be easily reconfigured for different uses; a pedestrian bridge; and a small building for concessions, restrooms, and support space. Timing of construction is dependent on the ongoing fundraising.</p>
<p>The current budget forecast of the Quarry Amphitheater project is $18.1 million.</p>
<p>Those involved in the project visualize a place where students from all 10 colleges can meet and exchange ideas, said Samuel Shaw ('17 politics/history), College Nine Student Union Assembly representative.</p>
<p>"I would really like to see the Quarry become a locus for public life at the school," Shaw said.</p>

How do we balance the joy and pain of life in a productive way? Does technology make us less than human&#8230;or something more?</em><br/><br/>These mega questions are themes running through <strong><em>Birth of Stars</em></strong>, an original new play melding scientific data, digital projections, and a human story to explore the parallel between the lives of stars and the people who gaze up at them.<br/><br/>It runs November 7-16 at the Experimental Theater on campus in the Theater Arts Center. <br/><br/>A co-production of the Theater Arts Department and the Digital Arts and New Media Program (DANM) at UC Santa Cruz, the event was created by a research team of scholars, students, and artists--led by Michael Chemers, professor of theater arts and director of DANM, Mark Krumholz, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and Jim Bierman, professor of theater arts. <br/><br/><em><strong>Birth of Stars</strong></em> is the story of Sofia, a 14-year-old girl growing up in a rural mountain community in California. Sofia has exceptional gifts-- including an extraordinary facility with science and an obsession with the life cycles of stars. These gifts, however, come at a terrible price.<br/><br/>&#8220;Sofia is outcast from her community, cruelly bullied (and cyber-bullied) by her classmates, and misunderstood by her mother, who is very religious,&#8221; said Chemers. &#8220;The one person who might understand her is a great scientist, but he also wrestles with terrible personal demons. Sofia&#8217;s journey through these obstacles is both a compelling and deeply human one, but also, in the end, transcendent and cosmic, in the grandest sense.&#8221;<br/><br/>The play combines live action with digital effects, including projections of simulations of stars forming in space. There is also a an interactive online component where the audience can learn about the science behind the play, plus get a rare behind-the-scenes look at the artistic process of creating.<br/><br/>&#8220;We were committed to telling a human story that would be strictly true to the science,&#8221; noted Chemers. &#8220;The digital projections range from visualizations of actual data collected by scientists, to more impressionistic imageries that give the audience insight into the characters&#8217; minds and emotional states. For instance, we get to look into a character&#8217;s mind while he suffers a debilitating panic attack.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;A lot of the play actually takes place online in the world of the play, and so we have various techniques using digital imagery to convey what is happening in cyberspace,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&#8217;re lucky to have our director, Joan Raspo, a DANM student who has enjoyed a long professional career directing in television.&#8221;<br/><br/>Although the interests of students in the cast and crew ranged from theater arts to astrophysics, Chemers noted that the team had no problems interacting and working together.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now there is a real hunger on both sides of the art/science divide, which after all is very artificial to begin with, to venture into one another&#8217;s camps,&#8221; said Chemers. &#8220;I know that the students who did not have a strong background in science (like me) were fascinated by the revelations about the universe that the astrophysicists take for granted. And I think the scientists were really eager to learn new vocabularies for expressing their findings in ways that are not only intellectually, but also emotionally meaningful, for non-scientists.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I was really pleased with the patience that both camps showed for one another,&#8221; Chemers added. &#8220;It was a very collegial and very idea-rich environment. We owe a great deal to my colleagues Mark Krumholz, who is a scientist with an artistic sensibility, and Jim Bierman, who is an artist unafraid of and fascinated by science, for creating this kind of environment.&#8221;<br/><br/>Krumholz noted that he especially enjoyed the process of building analogies between natural and human phenomena, and blending them together to make a compelling story true to both.<br/><br/>&#8220;Some of the ideas in the play are drawn from contemporary debates in theoretical astrophysics about the origin of stellar masses, including my own work,&#8221; said Krumholz. &#8220;More subtly, the play draws an analogy between the process by which a star forms and evolves, and the process by which a person, and in particular a scientific prodigy, matures, develops, and eventually ends his or her scientific career.&#8221;<br/><br/>&#8220;I helped the playwrights understand the science of these processes, and helped them weave those scientific phenomena into a human story,&#8221; he added.<br/><br/>______________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><em><strong>Birth of Stars</strong> will take place Friday, November 7 through Sunday, November 16 at the Experimental Theater, located in the Theater Arts Center on the UC Santa Cruz campus.

<p>Among the topics were population growth, world hunger, and sustainable farming practices. Napolitano found the meal and conversation so inspiring that she reportedly started scribbling out ideas for a universitywide compact on a napkin. And then, in a moment that would have made John Hancock proud, all the people at the table signed it.</p>
<p>In July, Napolitano went public with this ambitious plan to develop food practices systemwide, expand classroom offerings about sustainable food, and increase sustainable farming practices at all UC campuses. The UC Global Food Initiative will harness the University of California's resources to address one of the critical issues of our time: How to sustainably, equitably, and nutritiously feed a world population expected to reach 8 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is poised to play a pivotal role in the movement because the campus is nothing less than "The Mothership" of sustainable agriculture, said Daniel Press, executive director of UC Santa Cruz's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).</p>
<p>"There is no other university with such a well-established sustainable agricultural program," said Press. He met with Napolitano in June to discuss how the campus can help push the initiative forward. After all, CASFS has been an epicenter for sustainable farming for more than 45 years, and many of the organic farmers on the West Coast have trained at the center.</p>
<p>Since 1967, UC Santa Cruz has been a destination for those interested in learning organic farming and gardening skills. Trainees have come from around the world. "The training we provide here is being picked up in Latin America, Europe, and Asia," said Press.</p>
<p>With its long history as a training ground, CASFS has a national reputation for the skill and knowledge of its instructors and researchers. The center recently received a $4 million gift that is being used to create an endowment to keep CASFS a leader in the sustainable food world. This gift from an anonymous donor is the first step in building a $10 million endowment that will ensure the center's long-term productivity and impact.</p>
<p>Along the way, knowledge and best practices exported from UC Santa Cruz have helped "sustainable" and "organic" go mainstream.</p>
<p>The world has changed since the days when a group of hardworking UC Santa Cruz apprentices set up makeshift tents on the 30 acres of campus land that have become the Farm &amp; Garden.</p>
<p>"Sustainable farming is no longer seen as a 'flaky, hippie' activity," said Press. "The world has taken a different view of organic agriculture than it used to."</p>
<p>Our society has become aware of how food is farmed and where it comes from, and graduates from the CASFS apprenticeship program are changing the food world in the regions where they work, Press said.</p>
<h3>Winning over stomachs and minds</h3>
<p>While UC Santa Cruz is participating enthusiastically in Napolitano's initiative, it has already established its leadership in sustainability practices, and had been exporting its expertise across the globe long before that fateful "Night of the Napkin" at Chez Panisse.</p>
<p>One of the most important major fronts of the initiative is the dining hall. Alice Waters is famous for her efforts to challenge, and change up, the stereotypically greasy, dreary fare in school cafeterias across California. Producing local fruits and vegetables and serving them in dining halls and cafeterias has become a cornerstone of her Edible Schoolyard project, and is also a key component in the UC Global Food Initiative.</p>
<p>This farm-to-fork philosophy is long established at UC Santa Cruz. The campus's Farm to College program links the campus farm and other local farms to the dining halls and restaurants on campus. In the past decade, UC Santa Cruz's Dining Services has ramped up its "real food" purchases annually, including organically grown products, cagefree eggs, and sustainable seafood.</p>
<p>In spring 2010, UC Santa Cruz undergraduates voted overwhelmingly to approve Measure 43, the Sustainable Food, Health and Wellness Initiative. Measure 43 generates over $100,000 each year from student fees to support a wide variety of education efforts, student grants, and other activities designed to promote a healthy campus food system and enhance students' understanding of their food choices.</p>
<p>"We are reforming institutional food," Press said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CASFS graduates are extending this cafeteria-reform effort to the corporate realm. Jered Lawson, a '94 CASFS graduate and co-founder of the Pescadero working/ teaching farm Pie Ranch, is partnering with Google and LinkedIn to develop stronger relationships between their cafeterias and local production of nutrient-dense foods.</p>
<p>Lawson is paying it forward by training the next generation of sustainable farmers. Pie Ranch offers a year-long apprentice program and works with high school kids from San Francisco, Pacifica, and Pescadero.</p>
<p>Lawson is drawn to educating teens about food and social justice because he grew up in Los Angeles, where "the disconnect between people and the resources that sustain them was painfully obvious."</p>
<p>As an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz, Lawson (Kresge '92, community studies) read Wendell Berry's The Unsettling of America: Culture and Agriculture, which includes an impassioned defense of locallybased, diversified farm and food systems in the face of mono-crop, industrial-scale production geared for export. The book, first published in 1977, had a profound influence on his life and his work today.</p>
<p>"That book helped me see how many of the solutions for the challenges the world was facing have a basis in agriculture," Lawson said.</p>
<h3>Exporting best practices</h3>
<p>The UC Global Food Initiative wants to do more than just improve the health and quality of campus foods, and upgrade sustainability practices on campus. Another of its goals is to have UC graduates sustain and export those practices throughout the world.</p>
<p>One recent example is the acclaimed urban farmer Karen Washington, a 2008 graduate of the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture at CASFS who is one of five winners of a James Beard Foundation Leadership Award.</p>
<p>A native New Yorker, she returned to the Bronx after her apprenticeship and has won acclaim for her work to revitalize the area with urban gardens, as well as for national efforts to promote green jobs, healthy diets, and community gardens. Washington, who has been farming since she was 8 years old, was honored by Michelle Obama at the White House in 2010.</p>
<p>"The apprenticeship was one of the best experiences I ever had," said Washington. "It got me connected to the land. My time at UC Santa Cruz got me looking at food systems.&#8230; I came back to the Bronx energized and ready to kick butt."</p>
<p>Washington gives workshops on vegetable production and food advocacy&#8212;ideas that were at the center of her curriculum at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"I highly recommend the program to anyone who can do it. It's a family. I'm still connected to my classmates. It inspired me to be the person I am today in the food movement."</p>
<p>Supporters of the UC Global Food Initiative hope to have a positive impact across the world. Participating campuses are not afraid to ask themselves daunting questions, including whether it's even possible to sustainably and nutritiously feed a world population of 8 billion.</p>
<p>That is a question that CASFS alumni are exploring in far-flung places. Godfrey Kasozi, executive director of the Centre for Environment in western Uganda, is working to create a more sustainable economy and environment within his native country. He came to UC Santa Cruz as a CASFS apprentice in 1999 and returned to Uganda to train farmers in sustainable agriculture. He's also worked with small-scale farmers to establish their own gardens.</p>
<p>His intensive training at UC Santa Cruz is paying off now. "The Centre for Environment has increased income and food production to families in the region," he said.</p>
<h3>Seeking alternatives in the growing fields</h3>
<p>Individual activists are working hard to bring about social change through food. But it takes more than education and hard work to change how food is grown worldwide. CASFS staff members are also contributing to the Global Food Initiative through their cutting-edge research, including their development of alternatives to methyl bromide, a gas that is used to kill pests in growing fields.</p>
<p>For the last 50 years, methyl bromide has been almost ubiquitous. "Chemical fumigation has been used as the major tool for controlling soil-borne diseases and weeds in fruit and vegetable production all over the world," said Joji Muramoto, associate researcher in the Department of Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>But strong environmental and health concerns have led to heavy regulation. Research by Environmental Studies Professor Carol Shennan and Muramoto conducted at the UC Santa Cruz Farm has shown promising results with alternative approaches. One technique, known as anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) reduces pathogens for strawberries by creating a fermentation process in the soil. Researchers introduce a carbon source such as rice bran, chopped-up cover crops, or molasses to the strawberry bed, then irrigate and tarp off the beds to keep soil-borne diseases at bay.</p>
<p>The method has been tested for the past several seasons at the Farm and commercial fields across the California coast, and the results are promising: the technique has been shown to control the soil pathogen Verticillium dahliae, a major disease of strawberries. Now, ASD is being implemented in strawberry and cane berry fields in coastal California. It was used in 123 acres in 2012&#8211;2013, and 430 acres in the 2013&#8211;2014 season. Researchers expect its use and impact to keep growing.</p>
<p>Shennan and Muramoto, said Press, "are working on techniques for growing strawberries that are really revolutionary."</p>

courtesy Suzi Eszterhas&#160;</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>For over a decade, Suzi Eszterhas ('99, environmental studies) has captured stunning moments from the lives of animals around the world that few of us would see without her photographs.</p>
<p>The award-winning wildlife photographer specializes in animal families and made a name for herself by focusing on some of the world's most endangered species. Her interest in families grew from an initial love of cute baby animals.</p>
<p>"As I got older, I started to realize through my fascination with baby animals that these animal families are a fantastic backdrop to telling an animal's story," Eszterhas said by phone from California, where she was preparing to leave for a photo tour in Borneo.</p>
<p>By spending months&#8212;even years&#8212;in the wild observing families, Eszterhas has witnessed incredible events that take place during an animal's lifecycle.</p>
<p>"A mother will defend her cubs, cubs will die from predation, and all these wildlife dramas take place while documenting an animal family," she said.</p>
<p>Her work capturing these unique moments and more have led to publication in major magazines including <em>TIME</em> and <em>Smithsonian</em> magazine<em>.</em> They have also been featured in books including the recently released <em>A Future for Cheetahs</em> written by Cheetah Conservation Fund founder Laurie Marker, and a children's book series written by Eszterhas herself titled <em>Eye on the Wild.</em> In addition to this work she even makes time to share her talents with others by leading instructional tours and workshops in various countries including Australia, Brazil, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Eszterhas credits her success in part to the luck she's had throughout her life in meeting people who believed in her. During her time at UC Santa Cruz, the support of photography professor Norman Locks had a particularly profound effect on her.</p>
<p>"He really believed in me, taught me a lot, and challenged me," Eszterhas said. "One of the most valuable things he gave me was a lot of support, which I didn't get a huge amount of from my peers in photography classes because what I was doing was so different from their work, which was more fine art. Mine was more like harbor seals giving birth to pups."</p>
<p>Her peers may not have appreciated her work, but Locks did, challenging her to improve and telling her honestly if she was in a rut. He was also the one who allowed her to take photography classes even though she wasn't an art major. After meeting with Eszterhas and seeing she had a serious mission, he let her into the classes.</p>
<p>"I knew in my career as a wildlife photographer that a degree in environmental studies was more worthwhile than a degree in art. I wanted to take photographs about animal behavior and conservation issues," said Eszterhas.</p>
<p>Once out of school, Eszterhas couldn't immediately jump into the competitive wildlife photography field. She worked as a PR director for the Santa Cruz SPCA, where her boss was also very supportive. She was able to build a wildlife portfolio while managing to pay the bills and eventually moved to part-time work before finally quitting her day job altogether to pursue her dream.</p>
<p>"It's so important to have people who believe in you when something is difficult to break into, which can be demoralizing sometimes," she said. "Having these people around me who believed in me and gave me freedom was life-changing."</p>

Or should we focus on creating "useful" knowledge and informed, clear-headed graduates?<br/><br/>The answer is that we must do both.<br/><br/>Research universities must address problems of great societal need, but we must also pursue broad, basic research, because, frankly, we can't predict what's going to be useful. Through a combination of brilliance and serendipity, countless major transformations have come out of basic research.<br/><br/>Being educated at a research university, where new knowledge is created, offers undergraduates two great benefits. By observing and being part of the process of creation, students become critical thinkers, questioning the status quo. In addition, they learn how to solve new problems. These habits of the mind serve our graduates for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>These benefits begin to accrue in the classroom, where students learn to recognize important problems that are worth their time. Faculty are facilitators, helping students master the basic knowledge and skills needed to solve those problems. But I believe critical thinking and problem solving really blossom outside the classroom. <br/><br/>UC Santa Cruz is rich with opportunities for "hands-on" learning, including courses, internships, and independent research. <br/><br/>I'm most familiar with courses in the sciences that engage the "real world," such as our Marine Ecology Field Quarter course. For students like <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/02/seagrass-research.html">Hannah Perlkin and Emily Tucker</a>, that class opened doors that changed their lives and had an international impact. In lab courses like Environmental Phage Biology, students collect, isolate, and sequence the genomes of viruses that attack bacteria, making real contributions to our understanding of their diversity. Beyond the sciences, history professor Alan Christie's students did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQDxRx2GkL0">original archival research</a> for a photographic exhibition about Okinawa, then went to the island to interview residents about the photos. These experiences engage students and test them more meaningfully than any exam could.<br/><br/>Internships give students the opportunity to work with corporate and community partners. We offer <a href="http://mcd.ucsc.edu/academics/human-biology/health-science-internship.html">Health Science Internships</a>, and our <a href="http://calteach.ucsc.edu/">Cal Teach program</a> sponsors internships for prospective math and science teachers. In engineering, students can participate in <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2013/06/corporate-partners.html">corporate-sponsored senior design projects</a>.<br/><br/>Finally, our campus has a strong track record of championing independent student research. Alumna Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, still talks about how early-morning marine science expeditions shaped her experience at UC Santa Cruz. In June, bioengineering major Beau Norgeot won the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/05/steck-2014-honoree-beau-norgeot.html">Steck Family Award</a> &#8212; the annual prize for the year's most outstanding senior thesis &#8212; for his work on a new treatment for skin cancer. <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, independent research turns out to be a strong predictor of success in graduate school. The Physical and Biological Sciences Division is investing in these opportunities. We offer science undergraduates up to $1,500 grants to support their independent work. Last year, we awarded a total of $20,000 to help students work on projects as varied as materials science and developmental biology; this year, we will award $30,000. That is about 10 percent of what we need.<br/><br/>These "real-world" learning experiences, coupled with our general-education requirements and extracurricular activities, help students figure out what they care about and how to have an impact. That's self-discovery, and that's part of our mission, too.<br/><br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="43a7417d807270466b1f05a157f65e06"><name>rev-fall-14-greg-neri</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumni Profile / Greg Neri: A voice for urban teens</title><summary>Greg Neri’s award-winning books have yet to hit the New York Times best-seller list, but they have a distinction about which the UC Santa Cruz graduate is proud.

<p>Greg Neri (Cowell '87, theater arts and film) was 21 when life as he knew it ground to a halt.</p>
<p>Instead of days filled with acting, painting, filmmaking, and studies at UC Santa Cruz, Neri lay on his dorm room bed unable to move, read, or even listen to music without the world spinning vertiginously around him. What had seemed like a case of the flu was diagnosed as Meniere's Disease, a chronic inner-ear disorder that causes severe dizziness, nausea, and hearing loss.</p>
<p>Today, Neri, an award-winning author of teen novels, describes the illness as a turning point where he not only decided to view the disease as a metaphor about focus and life balance but also vowed not to pursue any job that didn't have meaning.</p>
<p>"I learned you can never take anything for granted, so why should I waste time doing anything meaningless?" says Neri, who beat the illness after a three-year battle. "It forced me to become a very practical dreamer."</p>
<p>That practical dream now includes a list of popular, reality-based Young Adult and Middle Grade novels&#8212;books like <i>Knockout Games,</i> which deals with an urban sport that involves teens attacking unsuspecting strangers; <i>Ghetto Cowboy,</i> about a hidden, inner-city black cowboy culture; and <i>Chess Rumble,</i> which delves into the street chess scene.</p>
<p>They are books that appeal to kids who don't like reading, to urban teens whose worlds are narrow and rough. They are the kinds of books, librarians tell Neri, that are among those most often stolen from library shelves.</p>
<p>Neri smiles as he related that fact while on a visit to Santa Cruz from his home in Florida. It's the kind of accolade he can appreciate.</p>
<p>Neri's life has always been what he calls "off the highway." A talented but introspective artist and filmmaker, he went to work with his brother in the nascent world of online digital media after several years of working in Hollywood. With clients like Disney and Mercedes Benz, he was excited by the challenge of the then-unknown world of the Internet. But he also wanted more, and he began teaching animation is L.A.'s inner-city schools.</p>
<p>Beneath the street-tough exterior of the kids he worked with, says the now 50-year-old Neri, he saw a vulnerability and innocence caused by a lack of exposure to the wider world.</p>
<p>"I started to see young people worth saving," says Neri. "It was about exposing them to other possibilities."</p>
<p>The chance to do just that happened when Neri's wife received a professorship in Tampa, Fla. Neri quit his L.A. job, moved east, and dug out a film script he'd written about the life of an 11-year-old gang-banger named Robert "Yummy" Sandifer, who'd been shot in 1994 on Chicago's South Side. The resulting graphic novel, <i>Yummy,</i> won a Coretta Scott King Award and was also honored by the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</p>
<p>Other books blossomed.</p>
<p>A chance encounter with a paddle-out for a young surfer who had died and the discovery of the underworld of wave-riding drug smugglers resulted in the book <i>Surf Mules.</i> A visit to an inner-city school in St. Louis began a conversation with a librarian about the so-called Knockout game, where kids attacked random strangers on the street.</p>
<p>"All these stories, true stories, started coming at me," Neri says of the book's genesis. "It was like a cross between <i>Lord of the Flies</i> and <i>Oliver Twist.</i> By the next day, I knew I had to write it."</p>
<p>Because Neri's stories are based in reality, he spends long hours on research and also makes it a point to travel to each book's locale. For his upcoming picture book on Johnny Cash, for instance, Neri drove the lonely dirt road to Cash's childhood home in Dyess, Ark., retraced Cash's long walk to town, and found himself at a family gathering to celebrate what would have been Cash's 80<sup>th</sup> birthday.</p>
<p>"To capture the truth, you have to see the light. You have to know how the air smells, how people talk, the words they use," Neri says.</p>
<p>His novels are about outsiders, about people trying to find their place in the world. They're the stories that resonate with urban youth, he says.</p>
<p>"You can't put Jane Austen in front of these kids because, socially and culturally, they won't recognize the voice," says Neri. "But the way I write, kids recognize that voice. They say, 'This book is about me. It's about my world.'"</p>
<p>"Greg stands out because he has a very fresh take on fiction," says his agent Edward Necarsulmer IV of Dunow, Carson &amp; Lerner Literary Agency in New York City. "What he does is get people to come face-to-face with, and really acknowledge, the way we live our lives now."</p>
<p>That uncommon approach, Neri says, was born at UC Santa Cruz, where the emphasis was not on grades but on risk-taking and pursuing your passion.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz opened my eyes to all these different ways of thinking about the world and all its diverse people," Neri says. "It made me independently minded."</p>
<p>It's the same message Neri delivers to his young readers, many of whom have never read a book before his. Neri, who writes under the pen name G. Neri, tells the story of a troublesome fifth-grader who got hold of his free-verse novella <i>Chess Rumble.</i> The young man went on to discover jazz poet Langston Hughes and Shakespeare. Later, he was accepted into a highly competitive creative arts magnet school on the strength of the poetry he wrote.</p>
<p>"My lesson to kids is: If you're open to taking a chance and walking down a different path, some really amazing things can happen," Neri says. "You never know what's around the next bend."&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="43c844b4807270466b1f05a1c6a3ee19"><name>rev-fall-14-TIUCSC</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>This is UC Santa Cruz</title><summary>News and people of note at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1414134000000</start-date><display-name>This is UC Santa Cruz</display-name><path>/2014/10/rev-fall-14-TIUCSC</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/rev-fall-14-TIUCSC</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1414181438591</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414622914854</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h3>Acclaimed architects to design new institute</h3>
<figure class="article-image width-480"><img alt="Rendering of the new UC Santa Cruz Institute of the Arts and Sciences by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects (image courtesy Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects)" height="407" src="images/ias-rendering.jpg" width="400"/><figcaption class="caption">Rendering of the new UC Santa Cruz Institute of the Arts and Sciences by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects (image courtesy Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects)</figcaption></figure>
UC Santa Cruz has selected award-winning New York firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects to design the campus&#8217;s new Institute of the Arts and Sciences.
<p>Conceived as more than a museum, the institute will be the first of its kind at a research university, focusing on both the arts and the sciences and their relationship to other disciplines. Designed to function as an intellectual hub, it will provide space for site-specific installations, exhibits, seminars, residencies by artists and scholars, and hands-on research by students and faculty.</p>
<p>With a national and international scope, the institute will also curate traveling art exhibitions and create projects linked to the university curriculum, drawing from the rich archives and collections of all of the UC campuses.</p>
<h3>Major (and minor) news</h3>
<p>Beginning this fall, UC Santa Cruz will offer two new programs:</p>
<p>&#8226; A major in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies (CRES), leading to a new bachelor of arts degree;</p>
<p>&#8226; A minor in sustainability studies with an engineering component aimed at giving students hands-on experience that can lead to jobs in a "green economy."</p>
<p>Curriculum for CRES, administered by the Humanities Division, will draw from the campus's Anthropology, Education, Feminist Studies, History, Film and Digital Media, Literature, History of Art and Visual Culture, Latin American and Latino Studies, Psychology, and Sociology departments.</p>
<p>The sustainability minor, which will accept 30 students during its first year, is multidisciplinary and is affiliated with College Eight. &#160;</p>
<h3>More science honors</h3>
<figure class="article-image"><img alt="James Estes, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology" height="147" src="images/estes-jim.jpg" width="96"/><figcaption class="caption">James Estes, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology</figcaption></figure>
<figure class="article-image"><img alt="Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences" height="146" src="images/lay-thorne.jpg" width="97"/><figcaption class="caption">Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences</figcaption></figure>
Two UC Santa Cruz scientists&#8212;James Estes, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Thorne Lay, professor of Earth and planetary sciences&#8212;have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of their distinguished and continuing achievements in original scientific research. Membership in the academy is one of the highest honors a U.S. scientist can receive, and Estes and Lay join 12 UC Santa Cruz colleagues as members of the prestigious group.
<p>The election "shows the growing impact that UC Santa Cruz faculty are having across all the sciences," said Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences. (For more on Lay's work, see "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/rev-fall-14-orders-of-magnitude.html">Orders of magnitude</a>").</p>
<p>Estes's work has revealed how predators can profoundly shape ecosystems, leading him to argue that their loss is of great concern for conservation biology. Lay's innovations in the study of earthquakes have generated insights about the structure of the deep Earth and how the Earth ruptures to generate quakes.&#160;</p>
<h3>Learning by doing</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz will undertake an ambitious program to revamp its introductory courses in biology, chemistry, and physics, replacing lectures with a more active learning approach.</p>
<p>Funded by a $1.5 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the effort is intended to ensure that more of the students who enter UC Santa Cruz planning to study science persist through the required courses to earn a science degree.</p>
<p>Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, will oversee the program and develop faculty teams to work on the different introductory course series.</p>
<p>"It's a big step forward for the campus," Koch said. "Our goal is to use a more active learning approach&#8212;instead of lecturing, we will have students learn by doing."</p>
<h3>POTUS notice</h3>

<figure class="article-image"><img alt="Maria Hanes (courtesy White House)" height="223" src="images/hanes-maria.jpg" width="145"/><figcaption class="caption">Maria Hanes (courtesy White House)</figcaption></figure>
A chance to visit the White House and chat with the president of the United States (POTUS) is a pretty big deal for most people, but UC Santa Cruz student Maria Hanes had the opportunity twice.
<p></p>
<p>First, the 19-year-old Oakes College student was invited to the White House Science Fair to demonstrate her "Concussion Cushion," a rubberized covering for football helmets to lessen the impact to players' heads. She had created the science project last year as a high school senior, and it won the top school and county prizes and placed in the 2013 California State Science Fair.</p>
<p>Then, President Obama invited her to return to the White House two days later for his summit on youth sports and concussions.</p>
<h3>Graduate enrollment up sharply</h3>
<p>Enrollment of grad students at UC Santa Cruz for fall 2014 has topped 1,625, the largest cohort in the campus's history&#8212;9 percent of total enrollment.</p>
<p>The increase is consistent with an upward trend that's been happening since 2007. Grad enrollment was 1,465 in 2013 and 1,389 in 2012.</p>
<p>Fueling the growth is a record incoming class for fall, estimated at 550 new grad students, up from 460 last year and 391 the previous year.</p>
<p>"This growth illustrates the continuing strong upward trend in UC Santa Cruz's attractiveness and reputation as a doctoral-granting and research institution," said Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. "We hope to match the size and proportion of graduate education at other UC campuses where the percentage of grad students is typically more than 15 percent."</p>
<h3>Julie Packard: philanthropy and pragmatism</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="article-image"><img alt="Julie Packard (photo by Tom O'Neal/Monterey Bay Aquarium)" height="147" src="images/packard-julie.jpg" width="97"/><figcaption class="caption">Julie Packard (photo by Tom O'Neal/Monterey Bay Aquarium)</figcaption></figure>
UC Santa Cruz received a $1 million gift from alumna Julie Packard (Crown '74, biology; M.A. '78), executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. By establishing the Dean's Fund for Diversity in the Sciences, Packard's gift will support programs at UC Santa Cruz that help underrepresented minority students excel in the sciences and mathematics.
<p></p>
<p>Packard, daughter of high-tech pioneer David Packard, says pragmatism runs deep in her family's blood.</p>
<p>"My father was a very practical person and not really a dreamer," remembered Packard of the man who co-founded Hewlett-Packard.</p>
<p>Philanthropy, she said, was also an early value, inculcated even before David Packard grew wealthy.</p>
<p>"Having resources to share is a gift, an opportunity," Packard said.</p>
<p>But a big checkbook isn't the only answer, she said. Change can come from acts as simple as voting, putting social media pressures on government, volunteering, and standing up for what you believe. "I think all of us need to engage," she said.</p>
<h3>Mixing it up on Science Hill</h3>
<p>An innovative graduate program is breaking down barriers between the biomedical sciences, encouraging interdisciplinary learning on Science Hill, and enabling students from different divisions to work closely together.</p>
<p>Now in its sixth year, the graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering (PBSE) is a collaborative graduate program that includes faculty from five departments spanning the Divisions of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>Originally, departments had their own graduate programs, "but research has evolved to where students now employ techniques and logic from multiple disciplines," said PBSE director Seth Rubin, chemistry and biochemistry professor.</p>
<p>"We needed a graduate program that reflects the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of biomedical research at UC Santa Cruz," said Doug Kellogg, Molecular, Cell and Developmental biology professor and PBSE's founding director.</p>
<p>Communication about science even spills over into the social realm.</p>
<p>"I'll walk downtown and see students from different tracks hanging out together," Kellogg said.</p>
<h3>Plaque honors Jack</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="article-image"><img alt="Jack Baskin (photo by Steve Kurtz) " height="148" src="images/baskin-jack.jpg" width="97"/><figcaption class="caption">Jack Baskin (photo by Steve Kurtz)&#160;</figcaption></figure>
UC Santa Cruz honored Jack Baskin for his many contributions to the Baskin School of Engineering in a ceremony in May. A plaque in his honor, unveiled by Chancellor George Blumenthal at the ceremony, now marks the entrance to the Baskin School of Engineering.
<p></p>
<p>Baskin has been actively supporting engineering programs at UC Santa Cruz for several decades, providing guidance to faculty and campus leadership as well as generous financial support. His cornerstone gift helped launch the Baskin School of Engineering in 1997, and his donations to the engineering school now total $8.8 million. Baskin and his wife, Peggy Downes Baskin, have also supported many other campus programs.</p>
<p>"When you look around UC Santa Cruz, you see Jack Baskin's influence everywhere," said Chancellor Blumenthal. "From engineering to the arts and humanities, his support transforms lives through scholarships, programs that open doors for our students, and endowed chairs for faculty that propel research and discovery."</p>
<h3>New librarian in town</h3>
<p></p>
<figure class="article-image"><img alt="Elizabeth Cowell (photo by Carolyn Latattuta)   " height="147" src="images/cowell-elizabeth.jpg" width="97"/><figcaption class="caption">Elizabeth Cowell (photo by Carolyn Latattuta)</figcaption></figure>
UC Santa Cruz has selected M. Elizabeth Cowell as the campus's new University Librarian.
<p></p>
<p>A leading voice in state and national advocacy efforts on behalf of university libraries, Cowell has 20 years of management experience in academic libraries with a strong record of accomplishment and strategic leadership in operations, fundraising, and innovation.</p>
<p>Cowell served as University Librarian at UC Santa Cruz in an interim capacity since July 15, 2013. She first came to the campus in 2008 as the Associate University Librarian for Public Services, where she worked with administration and staff to absorb challenging budget cuts while maintaining core library services.</p>
<p>Cowell played an integral role in the recent expansion and renovation of McHenry Library, implementing changes that have resulted in a dramatic increase in library attendance.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="43dc715e807270466b1f05a148c354eb"><name>rev-fall-14-hot-dates</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Hot Dates</title><summary>A summary of major UC Santa Cruz events, October 2014-April 2015</summary><start-date>1414134000000</start-date><display-name>Hot Dates</display-name><path>/2014/10/rev-fall-14-hot-dates</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/rev-fall-14-hot-dates</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1414182760755</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414182793898</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h2>Hot Dates</h2>

One of my roles as AVC of Colleges, Housing and Educational Services is to provide you with information that helps you to make safe choices. You should find the information below useful as you plan how and where to spend your time on Halloween this year.</p>
<p>On behalf of the University and the City of Santa Cruz, I encourage you to avoid downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night and instead choose to be on campus in order to participate in one or more of the many programs offered throughout our college and residential communities. Please see <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2014/2014-10-20.html">http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2014/2014-10-20.html</a> for a listing of programs being hosted on campus. In past years on Halloween, the downtown has been marred by incidents of violence, including stabbings. &#160;Out of concern for community members who may unintentionally become victims of violence, the City of Santa Cruz takes a no tolerance stance toward those that would disrupt the community&#8217;s safety.</p>
<p>Like the City of Santa Cruz, the UC Santa Cruz Police Department also enforces a no tolerance policy as regards unlawful, disruptive and/or dangerous behavior, and will deploy appropriate staff to deal with any issues that arise.&#160; The UC Santa Cruz Police Department and allied law enforcement agencies will forward information to Student Conduct regarding those campus affiliates engaged in unlawful, disruptive and/or dangerous behavior.&#160; Additional CSO&#8217;s will also be deployed throughout the campus&#8217; residential areas.&#160; Please be mindful and respectful of all campus policies, rules, and regulations.&#160;</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to report any suspicious activity or behavior by dialing 911 (on campus you may also dial 831/459-2231,<br/> ext 1). &#160;In addition, if you feel that someone is suffering from substance poisoning or other medical emergency, dial 911 immediately.</p>
<p>If, however, you do choose to go downtown, please be advised:</p>
<ul>
<li>UCSC will operate Night Owl buses on an augmented schedule from downtown Santa Cruz (Cathcart Street) approximately every 20 minutes from 11:45pm until 2:50am Halloween Night.&#160; CSO&#8217;s will be riding these buses to assist in identifying those individuals that are clearly intoxicated and cannot care for themselves or others.&#160; These individuals will not be allowed onto the bus, and Police and/or Fire may be summoned to assess individuals.</li>
<li>Bus service from the downtown area may be limited and you may find yourself walking back up to campus. Should you have to walk back to campus, please remember to be good neighbors (i.e., respect the city noise ordinance, traffic laws and the property of others). &#160;Try to walk home with others as it can be very dark along several sections of the route back to campus.</li>
<li>Be advised that the downtown area has been designated a &#8220;triple fine&#8221; area for violations of city ordinances beginning on Thursday, October 30<sup>th</sup> and extending through the early hours of Saturday, November 1. Should you be involved in any incident for which you are cited by the City of Santa Cruz Police, you will also be referred to the office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for possible University judicial action.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, the City of Santa Cruz Police Department has asked the University to share the following with UCSC students:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>If you are planning to come to downtown Santa Cruz on Halloween night, we ask that you have fun and behave responsibly. With the well-being of our residents and visitors in mind, the City has concentrated resources downtown to promote a safe environment that everyone can enjoy. This includes over 100 law enforcement officers from 9 agencies patrolling the downtown corridor and triple fines for certain violations of the Municipal Code. Triple fines and court costs make an alcoholic open container violation total $480, and littering almost $300.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>For your reference, information regarding the triple fine zone in the City of Santa Cruz is available at: <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2014/pdf/halloween-triple-fine-zone.pdf">http://housing.ucsc.edu/news/2014/pdf/halloween-triple-fine-zone.pdf</a></p>
<p>I hope that you have a fun and safe time this Halloween.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin>Dave Keller, Director of Housing Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="44041167807270466b1f05a165f89068"><name>rev-fall-14-50th-anniversary-events</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>50th anniversary events</title><summary>A few of the main UC Santa Cruz 50th anniversary events planned so far. </summary><keywords>UC Santa Cruz 50th anniversary events</keywords><start-date>1414134000000</start-date><display-name>50th anniversary events</display-name><path>/2014/10/rev-fall-14-50th-anniversary-events</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/rev-fall-14-50th-anniversary-events</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1414185357626</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414690015505</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><h2>50th anniversary events include:</h2>

<h3>Leading the charge</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz changed the life of California Secretary of Natural Resources John Laird.</p>
<p>"It didn't teach me what to think but how to think and how to analyze," said the 1972 politics grad who was affiliated with Stevenson College. "It's been the basis of an entire career for me."</p>
<p>As a way to mark that experience, Laird&#8212;one of the first openly gay men to serve in the California Legislature&#8212;is heading a committee to help celebrate a half century of innovation and learning at UC Santa Cruz during the 2015 anniversary year.</p>
<p>The 50th Anniversary Leadership Committee, comprised of 23 outstanding alumni, is currently planning events around some of the campus's most exceptional grads.&#160;&#160;</p>

<p><i>But we received so many excellent submissions that we decided to run honorable mentions online, as well. </i></p>
<h3>Print selections</h3>
<p><b><img alt="Old mill" height="273" src="images/old-mill.jpg" width="400"/><br/>Cami Winslow</b> (College Ten &#8216;10, anthropology) took this photo of an old wooden mill in the ghost town of Crystal, Colo. While living in Colorado, she saw a postcard with a photo of this mill and thought, &#8220;I must go there!&#8221; She had to hike in to the mill but says it was worth every mile.</p>
<p><img alt="Old door in Erbil" height="529" src="images/old-door.jpg" width="376"/><br/>In 2008&#8211;2009 <b>Robert Katzenson</b> (Stevenson &#8216;83, history) was an employee of the Kurdistan Regional Government&#8217;s Ministry of Municipalities. He lived in Erbil (the capital of the Kurdish region) and commuted back periodically to his home in the Netherlands. The Erbil Citadel is purportedly the oldest continuously inhabited place in the world and was used by Kurdish refugees fleeing the genocide Saddam Hussein inflicted on the Kurds in the 1990s. The Citadel&#8217;s Ottoman-era structures exhibited some stunning period architecture including this image of a derelict door. (More images at robkatzenson.com.)</p>

A quick walk toward the river brought me to this red bench. Suffused with late afternoon sun, the bench invited me to connect with the river, the surrounding forest and the mountains beyond."</p>

But he found there was little interest at the time in developing the technology further.</p>
<p>"People told me that there wasn't any profit in it because this disease only affects people in the developing world," Yanik said.</p>
<p>Now, however, Ebola hemorrhagic fever has captured the attention of first world countries in a big way. The current outbreak in West Africa began spreading out of control just as Yanik was setting up his lab as a new faculty member at UC Santa Cruz, where he is an assistant professor of electrical engineering. Yanik plans to resume his work on virus detection in addition to ongoing projects involving biosensors for other biomedical applications. The current Ebola crisis may subside before his technology can be perfected, since there are still many challenges to overcome, but the need will remain for simple and inexpensive virus detection techniques, he said.</p>
<p>"The truth is that Lassa virus, which is related to Ebola and also causes hemorrhagic fever, infects nearly half a million people every year in Africa and kills more people than Ebola, but it doesn't make the news. So there has been an ongoing crisis with hemorrhagic fever viruses, and now it's finally getting some serious attention," Yanik said.</p>
<p>His goal is to create a low-cost biosensor that can be used to detect specific viruses without the need for skilled operators or expensive equipment. "We need a platform for virus detection that is like the pregnancy tests you can use at home," Yanik said. "The initial symptoms of hemorrhagic fever are similar to the flu, and you just cannot treat every person with flu symptoms as a potential Ebola-infected patient. It needs to be simple and cheap."</p>
<p><strong>Nanotechnology</strong></p>
<p>Nanotechnology may provide a solution. Advances in nanotechnology have enabled researchers to fabricate novel materials with precise structures on the scale of nanometers (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter). A "plasmonic nanohole," for example, is a tiny hole a few hundred nanometers across. Yanik's <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl103025u">2010 paper</a> described a biosensor based on arrays of nanoholes in a metallic surface that interact with light in predictable ways. Using antibodies on the sensor surface to bind specific viruses, the researchers showed that binding of the virus caused a detectable change in the color of light transmitted by the nanohole arrays.</p>
<p>Detecting the color change, however, required the use of a spectrometer. Yanik later figured out how to make a sensor that could be read with the naked eye, without any need for electronic instruments. "You can use sunlight as the light source and the human eye as the detector," he said.</p>
<p>He published that technique in a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/29/11784.abstract">2011 paper</a> in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. The sensor technology involves realms of physics far more complex than the relatively straightforward enzymatic reactions involved in a pregnancy test. Light transmission through nanohole arrays occurs through a phenomenon known as "surface plasmon resonances," which involves the oscillations of free electrons in a metallic surface. Yanik's 2011 paper showed that light transmission could be greatly enhanced by exploiting a phenomenon called Fano resonances (named for Italian physicist Ugo Fano).</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Label-free detection</strong></p>
<p>"This effect causes a huge difference in light transmission that you can see with the naked eye," Yanik said. Unlike conventional laboratory tests such as PCR and ELISA (currently the standard tests for Ebola infection), Yanik's approach does not rely on labeling with fluorescent tags or other markers to see the results. "The results can be read immediately after the pathogen binds to the sensor," he said.</p>
<p>Further work is needed, however, to improve the sensitivity of the sensor to the point where it could be effective for virus detection in routine "point-of-care" clinical evaluations. Yanik plans to work with <a href="http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/faculty/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=zhang">Jin Zhang</a>, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, to develop a new version of the sensor. Zhang's research group works on advanced nanomaterials for a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>"He has the exact technology I need to make the biosensor more sensitive for virus detection, so we are working on a proposal to combine his approach with ours," Yanik said.</p>
<p>Another major focus of Yanik's research is the detection and isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of cancer patients. CTCs can spread cancer to other parts of the body (metastasis), and detecting them in blood samples can have important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Yanik is working on methods for capturing CTCs with high efficiency and isolating them for molecular analysis. He began this work as a research associate at Harvard University Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital before coming to UC Santa Cruz. At UCSC, he is working with Zhu Wang, an assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, who studies genetic alterations in prostate cancer.</p>
<p>"It was a natural match," Yanik said. "We met during an orientation meeting for new faculty, and our collaboration spun off from there."</p>
<p>Both plasmonic biosensors and CTC technology are crowded fields with lots of competition, but Yanik has confidence in the methods he has developed. "There are a lot of different approaches to these problems, but we have achieved some unprecedented results with our technology," he said. "I am pretty optimistic that we can make a difference in people's lives."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5297e9c3807270466b1f05a10e740b03"><name>online-ed-proposals</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Online Education Call for Proposals, 2014-2015</title><summary>In fall of 2014 there are three different but related opportunities for faculty to develop online courses.</summary><start-date>1414393200000</start-date><display-name>Online education proposals </display-name><path>/2014/10/online-ed-proposals</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/online-ed-proposals</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1414429927828</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414430258444</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In fall of 2014 there are three different but related opportunities for faculty to develop online courses.</p>

<p>Evil is treated as part of a &#8220;thrilling intellectual journey,&#8221; while good characters are muted and good intentions are all too often dismissed as &#8220;stupid,&#8221; Morrison, 83, told a capacity crowd at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz on Saturday (October 25). <br/><br/>Morrison was in town to deliver the Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture before heading to the Cocoanut Grove ballroom, where she accepted the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal. Her appearance was one of the highlights the 2014 UC Santa Cruz Founders Celebration.<br/><br/><strong>Founders Celebration awardees</strong></p>
<p>Also feted during the celebration were Craig Haney, professor of psychology and legal studies, selected by the Academic Senate to give the Faculty Research Lecture; Mark Headley (Stevenson '83, politics and economics), winner of the Alumni Association Achievement Award; and the Long Family and Joseph and Vera Long Foundation, awarded the Fiat Lux Award for distinguished volunteer leadership and outstanding generosity to the campus since its founding. <br/><br/>Mistress of ceremonies was Teri L. Jackson (Stevenson '77, politics), who spent many years as a trial attorney, and in 2002 became the first African American woman appointed to the Superior Court bench in San Francisco.<br/><br/>Chancellor George Blumenthal praised the winners for their courage, research, scholarship, and service. <br/><br/>Throughout his prolific career, Haney has written and spoken widely against the prevailing practices of incarceration in the United States. He said UC Santa Cruz and its commitment to social justice provides him the intellectual atmosphere to pursue his work. <br/><br/>Headley and his wife, Christina Pehl, recently established the Dorothy E. Everett Chair that supports the campus's Global Information Internship Program (GIIP), which mentors students in information technology and social entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>Speaking for the Long family, Milton Long, Joseph and Vera's grandson, said the family seldom responds to such invitations but did so because longtime professor Gary Griggs called and they remember the close collaboration between Joseph Long and Dean McHenry, UCSC's founding chancellor. <br/><br/>Blumenthal called Morrison, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature, and the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for her novel Beloved,&#160; "one of the greatest storytellers of our time." &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Horror and hope in Morrison's work<br/></strong></p>
<p>Morrison's books contain many horrific incidents.&#160; But in an interview prior to the talk, she said she takes care &#8220;never to leave a text with the reader hopeless or even helpless; certainly somebody in there has to survive in the atmosphere of goodness or love.&#8221;<br/><br/>Elaborating during her lecture, Morrison said forces of goodness, and acts of altruism in her novels have a strong impact on her stories. For her, a successful, impactful novel must have a protagonist &#8220;who learns something vital and insightful. I want to make sure that acts of goodness produce language.&#8221;<br/><br/>But Morrison made a clear distinction between effective and powerful &#8220;good&#8221; characters and sentimental depictions of good. In her most recent novel, Home, a group of women provide &#8220;unsolicited but necessary nursing care to a woman who spent a lifetime despising them.&#8221; They tell her to shut up when she cries out in pain &#8211; and yet they save her life. &#8220;There is nothing soothing about their words, just their deeds.&#8221; <br/><br/>Morrison used her own works as examples of literature that stand apart from novels&#8211;especially those written after World War I&#8211;that privilege evil while making fun of, or muting, good characters and good intentions. <br/><br/>As part of her exploration of goodness, Morrison also turned away from the world of imaginative fiction and looked into the aftermath of an horrific shooting of 10 Amish girls in 2006; in an expression of grace and goodness, the Amish community forgave the killer and refused to seek vengeance, only to be portrayed in the news media as &#8220;bizarre&#8221; for their restraint, she said. <br/><br/><strong>Baffling theories of human goodness</strong></p>
<p>While Morrison admitted to some confusion as she explored a baffling &#8220;bouquet&#8221; of theories about human goodness, the animal kingdom provided more clarity. <br/><br/>Examining the behavior of bats, ants, and other creatures help her look at the roots of altruism and test some of the prevailing theories about acts of self-sacrifice, and whether such behaviors are engrained or learned, or a survival mechanism that aids the collective, &#8220;A kind of brother to Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution.&#8221; <br/><br/>To illustrate her point, she spoke of squirrels that call attention to themselves to spare others from predators, and ants that return to the bodies of dead ants and carry them off. <br/><br/>Morrison&#8217;s longtime friend Angela Davis, the scholar, activist, and UC Santa Cruz professor emerita, was on hand to introduce her, and to praise her for &#8220;re-imagining slavery as involving real people with important interior lives that are worth exploring.&#8221; <br/><br/>They have been friends since the early '70s, when Morrison, while working as an editor at Random House, edited Davis's autobiography, encouraging her to add cinematic touches and gripping scenes to her story.<br/><br/>After the talk, Morrison engaged in a dialogue with UC Santa Cruz humanities dean William Ladusaw, who shared selected questions from audience members, who expressed concern that historic figures are turned into mere symbols after they die. Morrison agreed; she said that it was one thing to lionize figures like Gandhi after they were gone, and another thing to support them through their &#8220;trouble&#8221; while they were alive. <br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/morrison-davis-q-a.html</url><title>Extended Q&amp;A with Toni Morrison and Angela Davis</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="58aebe93807270466b1f05a16f19b2c4"><name>bike-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz named a 'silver bicycle-friendly' university</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has been named a 'silver bicycle-friendly' university by the League of American Bicyclists.</summary><start-date>1414531800000</start-date><display-name>Bike friendly award</display-name><path>/2014/10/bike-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/bike-award</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1414532087388</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414601415920</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Campus Life</value><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Sustainability</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UC Santa Cruz Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>publicaffairs@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/biking-award-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/biking-award-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>biking-award-400.jpg</name><display-name>biking-award-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>327975</file-size><width>400</width><height>574</height></image><image-alt>bicycle fans</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/biking-award-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/biking-award-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>biking-award-80.jpg</name><display-name>biking-award-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>31686</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>student in a bike helment </image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Student Robert Jones, left, a regular bike rider on campus, with Cathy Crowe of Transportion and Parking Services, and Melissa Ott, a recent graduate who now works with the UC Santa Cruz Sustainability Office.

"It's not easy to persuade people to bike up our hills, but those of us who make the trip know that once they do, the rewarding views, endorphins, and sense of community are so worth the sweat." <br/><br/>More information about UCSC&#8217;s bike program can be found online at <a href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/bikes/index.html">http://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/bikes/index.html</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://taps.ucsc.edu/commute-options/bikes/index.htm</url><title>UC Santa Cruz bike program</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url> http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/BFU_2014_Awards_Only.pdf</url><title>League of American Bicyclists 2014 awards</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/BFU_Master_Award_List_2014_.pdf</url><title>League's list of 100 bicycle-friendly universities</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5c889ad9807270466b1f05a17367353c"><name>browser-in-a-box</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz offers 'Genome Browser in a Box' for local installations</title><summary>New software enables scientists to quickly install the UCSC Genome Browser on their own computers to protect sensitive genomic data.</summary><keywords>UCSC Genome Browser, Jim Kent, Max Haeussler, Genomics Institute, Genome Browser in a Box, Genome Browser</keywords><start-date>1414566000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz offers 'Genome Browser in a Box' for local installations</display-name><path>/2014/10/browser-in-a-box</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/browser-in-a-box</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1414596696729</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1415207251559</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissae Fellet</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/browser-team2-450.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/browser-team2-450.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>browser-team2-450.jpg</name><display-name>browser-team2-450.jpg</display-name><file-size>104321</file-size><width>450</width><height>297</height></image><image-alt>browser team</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/browser-team2-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/browser-team2-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>browser-team2-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>browser-team2-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27492</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Jim Kent</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Members of the UCSC Genome Browser team (left to right): Kate Rosenbloom, Galt Barber, Jim Kent, Bob Kuhn, Jonathan Casper, Ann Zweig, Brian Lee, Matthew Speir, Donna Karolchik, and Hiram Clawson.

The browser has always been readily accessible online, providing a variety of tools for studying genome sequences. But some users require a local installation so they can use the UCSC Genome Browser with private or proprietary data.</p>
<p>A new product, called the "Genome Browser in a Box," enables individual scientists to install the browser on their own computers in about an hour. Previously, local installation of the browser was a laborious process requiring large amounts of server space.</p>
<p>"The new product is a virtual environment that allows the installation of the Genome Browser on a laptop with a minimum of fussing over the setup," said Jim Kent, who developed the UCSC Genome Browser in 2000 after helping assemble the first working draft of the human genome sequence. He is now director of the Genome Browser project at the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Web-based portal</strong></p>
<p>The UCSC Genome Browser is an efficient way to access and visualize publicly available information associated with particular genome sequences. The web-based browser is a portal to a database containing the genomes of about 100 species, including human, mouse, and fruit fly. The site gets about one million hits a day and serves about 150,000 users, mainly scientific researchers in academia and biotech companies looking to interpret results.</p>
<p>"It's not Google or Yahoo, but it's a respectable website," Kent said.</p>
<p>Researchers use the UCSC Genome Browser to locate functional genes, identify sequences associated with disease, and compare sequences between individuals or species. Local installation enables researchers to study private or proprietary genomic data, such as personal genome sequences.</p>
<p>The rapidly falling cost of genome sequencing is fueling the growth of genomics in medical research and diagnostics. This raises a range of privacy and confidentiality issues, however, because a person's genome can reveal health conditions or family connections that could lead to profiling or discrimination.</p>
<p>As genome sequencing becomes more widely used as a tool for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, the amount of sensitive genetic information will increase. Keeping that information on local computers behind a firewall maintains its confidentiality. But that also separates the data from large web-based databases like the Genome Browser that provide biological context. Applications like Genome Browser in a Box show that there is at least a theoretical fix to the problem of searching large databases using sensitive data, said Max Haeussler, a postdoctoral researcher at the Genomics Institute and the lead engineer for the project.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Virtual machine</strong></p>
<p>To develop it, Haeussler's team used virtualization technology similar to the programs that allow one computer to run two different operating systems. In those programs, software called a virtual machine simulates one operating system. In the Genome Browser in a Box, a virtual machine simulates a server loaded with the complete browser.</p>
<p>The code for the complete UCSC Genome Browser has been, and remains, open source. That means academic researchers and non-profit users can use that code to recreate the browser on an internal server without paying a licensing fee. Corporate researchers, however, pay a licensing fee to use the browser code. Once obtained, installing the full genome browser requires a week of effort, terabytes of space on a server, and a technologically savvy person to help.</p>
<p>With Genome Browser in a Box, the browser developers have greatly simplified that process. The software can run on a laptop, desktop, or server using any operating system. It also has the same look and feel as the web version, Haeussler said.</p>
<p>The Genome Browser in a Box is free for academic, educational and nonprofit use, said product manager Ann Zweig. The commercial licensing fee is reduced compared to the fee for the full genome browser. Licenses for the full UCSC Genome Browser or the Genome Browser in a Box can be purchased through a new online store at <a href="https://genome-store.ucsc.edu">genome-store.ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

Davis introduced Morrison while she was in Santa Cruz to deliver the Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture at the Rio Theater on October 25. The subject: &#8220;Literature and the Silence of Goodness.&#8221; Angela Davis was interviewed by phone from Massachusetts, and Toni Morrison from upstate New York. <br/><br/><strong>Dan White:</strong> I would guess that even some of your most ardent fans don&#8217;t realize that you were an influential editor at Random House for 20 years. At the time, you were bringing out African American voices, including some strong feminist voices, to a wider audience. <br/><br/><strong>Toni Morrison:</strong> Well, I was determined to do that when I came there. There was a lot of activity going on, a lot of activism, and I thought, 'I will publish these voices instead of marching.' I thought it was my responsibility to publish African American and African writers who would otherwise not be published or not be published well, or edited well, and so I brought out works by (Muhammad) Ali and Toni Cade (Bambara) and Gayl (Jones), and I did a whole collection of African short stories and then I did <em>The Black Book</em>, and I thought that was important because I was good at it, because I had read some books by black writers about black things, and they were so badly edited, it made you want to weep. Like <em>Roots</em> (by Alex Haley). Have you ever read that?<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> I was a kid when it came out. I did see most of the mini-series.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>TM:</strong> Oh, they just threw (the book) together. It was backward anyway, and they threw in the ending. He says &#8216;that child was me.&#8217; We knew that in the beginning!<br/><br/><strong>To Angela Davis:</strong> During her time at Random House, Toni Morrison edited your biography, which was published in 1974. How did that initial connection come about? <br/><br/><strong>AD:</strong>&#160; She contacted me. I wasn&#8217;t so much interested in writing an autobiography. I was very young. I think I was 26 years old. Who writes an autobiography at that age? Also, I wasn&#8217;t that interested in writing a book that was focused on a personal trajectory. Of course, at that time, the paradigm for the autobiography, as far as I was concerned, was the heroic individual, and I certainly did not want to represent myself in that way.&#160; But Toni Morrison&#160; persuaded me that I could write it the way I wanted to; it could be the story not only of my life but of the movement in which I had become involved, and she was successful. <br/><br/><strong>To Angela Davis:</strong> Your autobiography is very cinematic. I&#8217;ve read a lot of your more academic work, but this one is constructed like a novel. In the very beginning, you&#8217;re trying to get away from the FBI, and there is this palpable sense of fear. The reader is right in the middle of a manhunt. I was wondering how much of that comes from the influence of your mentor, Toni Morrison.<br/><br/><strong>AD:</strong> The decision to begin the story at the moment when I went underground and then would be arrested was an interesting way of drawing people into a story, the outlines of which they already knew because, of course, my being placed on the FBI 10 most wanted list was publicized all around the country, all around the world. So yes, there was the use of the kind of cinematic strategy of flashback, and this was thanks to input from my editor, Toni Morrison. She did not rewrite things for me, but she asked me questions. She would say, &#8216;what did the space look like? What was in the room, and how would you describe it?&#8217; It was quite an amazing experience for me to have her as a mentor. My experience with writing was primarily writing about philosophical issues. I really had to learn about how to write something that would produce images in people&#8217;s minds that would draw them into a story. <br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong>&#160; Working with Angela was sui generis, and I didn&#8217;t just edit her book. I went on her book tour with her; I was her handler! All over. This was before I was Toni Morrison (Morrison&#8217;s real name is Chloe Wofford. Toni is her nickname, and 'Morrison' is the last name of her ex-husband.) We were in Scandinavia at one point, and I was a good handler.&#160; People would come up to her you, know: &#8216;My brother is in prison, and I was wondering, could we have a cocktail party (to raise money for him)?&#8217; and the thing was, (Davis) would stop and listen, and say, &#8216;where is he?&#8217;, and I would say, 'Angela, come on!'<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> You seem to be someone who is good at setting boundaries with other people. <br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes. that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve learned three things.&#160; I tell everybody that I never used these words much but now I am happy to use them pretty much all the time. One is &#8216;no.&#8217; The other one is &#8216;shut up.&#8217; And the last one is &#8216;get out!&#8217; Now that I have that arsenal, I could go forth. (laughs.)<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> This is a bit of an aside, but it relates to what you just said about creating firm boundaries with people. Once, I saw you reading at Columbia University, and a woman stood up and said, &#8220;Toni Morrison, I would love to read you this poem I wrote," and you said, &#8220;No.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> I said that? (laughs.)<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> To AD: When you were working with Toni Morrison, she was bringing new books to life of her own. <em>The Bluest Eye</em> was written while she was still at Random House. Did you ever have a chance to see her in action, working on a book? <br/><br/><strong>AD:</strong> Absolutely. I had the opportunity to read <em>The Bluest Eye</em> before most people I know were exposed to it, and I can remember that she would write during every spare moment. This is something that really impressed me about her: her discipline, her focus. One time, I was sitting in her house in Rockland County, (New York), and she had to drive in to (Manhattan) every day to work at Random House. I would see her when we were driving in. When there was traffic, she would pull out a little pad and write something or pull out a scrap of paper here or there, and I realized she was living the life of the next novel in her mind, regardless of whatever else was happening. I have always been impressed by her ability to be so focused and to inhabit the universe of her writing while not neglecting the universe that involves the rest of us.<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> And she did all this while raising two boys on her own, dealing with the commute, and holding down a high-powered job.<br/><br/><strong>AD:</strong>&#160; And she was not a hermit so she also had a very active social life as well. To be able to maintain that focus &#8211; this is something she continues to do today. I am impressed by the regularity with which her novels are published. She is always working on a project. She always inhabits that other world.<br/><br/><strong>DW to TM:</strong> Angela Davis has gone into detail about your relentless drive, about how often you bring out new books. I wanted to know what continues to spur you on in your career at this point. (Morrison is now 83.) Is there some other form you haven&#8217;t tried yet, some goal you feel you haven&#8217;t met? <br/><br/><strong>TM:&#160;</strong> No, I&#8217;ve pretty much run the gamut, but writing novels is the world to me, literally. The outside world can be OK or not OK, beautiful or not beautiful, but I am in control here. When I&#8217;m writing, nobody&#8217;s telling me what to do. The expectations are high because they are mine, and that is a kind of freedom I don&#8217;t have anywhere else. Nowhere. I&#8217;m not very happy when I don&#8217;t have a project. I don&#8217;t have to actually be developing a manuscript but if I don&#8217;t have an idea about the beginning of it, wondering about it ...<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> This one is for Angela Davis. You&#8217;ve been friends with Toni Morrison for 40 years now, and you&#8217;ve had a chance to see her work develop and her influence grow. I was hoping you could comment on the way Toni Morrison&#8217;s work has influenced the literary world, and the world in general. <br/><br/><strong>AD:</strong> As a result of her work and the work of some others, it became possible to imagine slavery very differently, to humanize slavery, to remember the system of slavery did not destroy the humanity of those whom it enslaved; oftentimes, the assumption is that slavery was all bad, and of course, if you portray slaves as experiencing joy or making music, you somehow violate the ethics of recognizing slavery as evil, but of course, if slaves were not able to reach down and find some humanity within themselves, they would have ceased to be human beings, literally. That is why the focus on reimagining slave subjectivities is so important. <em>Beloved</em>, of course, allows us to do this, and it renders a very different approach, not only to literature but also to history and to popular narratives about slave histories. A film like <em>Twelve Years a Slave</em> is very important, but at the same time, there was a dimension that was lacking.<br/><br/><strong>DW to TM:</strong> Perhaps you could reflect on how slavery was portrayed when you first took it on as a subject.<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> The way slavery was portrayed was different. It changes when you take away &#8216;the white gaze.&#8217; All those wonderful writers who wrote after they were freed were writing for abolitionists. They didn&#8217;t think I was going to read it, and so they had to please or not disturb white abolitionists with their stories, so you read Frederick Douglass, and I can feel the anger that he erases. That&#8217;s not there. If he knew I was reading it, it might be a very different book. Even Ralph Ellison. I tell people he called the book <em>Invisible Man</em>. As good as the book is, my initial response is, 'Invisible to whom?'<br/><br/><strong>DW</strong> <strong>for Toni Morrison:</strong> While you&#8217;ve dealt with some truly horrific subject matter in your books, including slavery, you&#8217;ve also placed a lot of emphasis on narrativizing good in your work. Why is that so important to you as a value in your work? &#160;<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Goodness&#8212;there really isn&#8217;t anything else that humans ought to be cultivating and living for. The rest of it is petty and selfish, cartoonish almost.&#160; I always think of evil with a top hat and a big band and a cape, a cane,&#160; maybe some shiny jewelry, so you are very, very attracted by the glitter. I thought the most impressive thing that the Nazis did for their cause was their designer, their uniforms, the length of their boots. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> That, and the power of the loudspeaker. <br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes. Crowds, loudspeakers, a big drama, and people were seduced: those who were not repelled and those who were not slaughtered. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> You&#8217;ve mentioned that evil has gotten an enormous promotion in literature while good has been dragged off center stage. You&#8217;ve mentioned that goodness often comes across as weak or muffled or silent.<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong>&#160; It wasn&#8217;t true in literature in the early days. There was always a hero who prevailed. As awful as things could happen in a Dickens novel, it ended up with the survival and triumph of high morality, of people who deserved to triumph. But something happened. Now, I&#8217;m not entirely sure about this, but I think it is after World War I with novelists at any rate, and certainly some of the war poets. Perhaps they understood themselves as attacking evil but they ended up theatricalizing it and the good people were fairly stupid or unlucky or what have you. There are references in literature to the silencing of goodness &#8230; I am interested in pulling from the modern canon what I know and what I believe about this adoration and fascination, this compulsion to display evil. Even if there is a mild attempt to say that it is evil, nevertheless, it&#8217;s hogging the stage in many novels. I think goodness is weak in literature almost like it is in the culture. This is just a general observation. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> In light of this, how do you dramatize good in your own stories?<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong>&#160; For me, there is always an ending in which somebody knows something extremely important that they didn&#8217;t know before so the acquisition of knowledge is a gesture of mine toward goodness. The accumulation of events, theories, changes of mind, encounters, whatever is going on at the end of the book, it tends to move toward some kind of epiphany that is a revelation of a better self. Now, there is a lot of sadness and melancholy among the people in my books but strategically, structurally, that is what I think is going on.&#160; I might not be the best example of what I am describing in the lecture (in Santa Cruz) but I don&#8217;t want to leave a text with the reader hopeless or even helpless, and certainly somebody in there has to survive in the atmosphere of goodness or love, and <em>Love</em> is the best example of my books of that.<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> In a lecture at the Harvard Divinity School in 2012, you also delved into different interpretations &#8211; different theories &#8211; about the reasons for altruism. According to one interpretation you mentioned in the lecture, altruism is not an innate value. It has to be taught, learned. With this in mind, do you think novels can, or should, bear an ethical responsibility, a moral weight? <br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> I would hate to say they bear that weight but it would be more interesting to me if they would examine that (issue) more carefully, not in black and white terms, you know, villains and heroes, but in some other way. I&#8217;ve read some interesting definitions of altruism, none of them very helpful or positive. One said it was narcissism,&#160; and another said it was kind of a mental illness. The notion of its being taught is the question you put to me. And I thought about that that when I went, as I one often does when the human answers aren&#8217;t (satisfying), to the animal world. There is so much sacrifice of the one for the community, whether it is ants who are always trailing back to find the body of another ant, or bats that sacrifice themselves when they hear something to save the cave, or birds that will call attention to themselves to warn the rest of the flock. It&#8217;s all over the natural world. Of course, there are lots of instance of sacrifice (in the human realm), parental sacrifices that are well known, and lovers in the history of narrative, but I was just particularly interested in what was happening currently, you know,&#160; in the last 40 years. Many writers believe that evil is just more interesting than goodness. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> And you&#8217;ve found ways to push the good back to center stage, at least in your own works. One example that comes to mind is your most recent novel, <em>Home,</em> where you have forces of good that not are polite, the 'country women who loved mean.' And when someone complains, they say, 'Hush up, hush.'<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> That&#8217;s right. &#8216;Shut up!&#8217;<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong>&#160; These women will nurse a dying person back to life but they don&#8217;t coddle at all. So, clearly, you are making a distinction between these forces of goodness and a kind of sentimentality ...<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes, exactly. When their maker said, 'What did you do?', they didn&#8217;t want to say, 'Um ...' &#160;They had to answer. That is so familiar to me from my family. I am glad you brought up the word sentimentality. It is not that. It is something else that works. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> Their desire to help Cee (an ailing character in the novel <em>Home</em>) seems like an innate value &#160;and a shared value in their community. But you&#8217;ve also had good people going against the collective, like the priest in your novel <em>A Mercy</em>. He takes such a risk when he teaches slaves to read.<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes. He could be thrown in prison and fined. He had to sneak off and teach them to read. Who knows why he did that? The point is he <em>thought</em> it was a valuable thing to do. And I remember that kid in <em>Love</em> who was with a bunch of friends at a party who were raping a girl, and he couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t.<br/><br/><strong>DM:</strong> And he gets so much grief for that &#8230;<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes, he does. That gesture&#160; of &#8216;I will not participate&#8217; &#8211; in doing this, he sacrifices his reputation, and therefore, he could be the one at the end of the book who could salvage this woman. &#160;I am much more interested in the movement from evil and selfishness to something else.<br/><br/><strong>DM:</strong> And you have works that complicate the idea of good and evil. For me, as a reader, one of the most emotionally difficult aspects of <em>Beloved</em> is the withholding of judgment of Sethe, the main character, for killing her child. You didn&#8217;t seem to be condemning her. The moral weighing is left up to the reader.<br/><br/><strong>TM</strong>:&#160; That was the big deal in the writing of&#160;<em>Belove</em>d, this story of this woman, Margaret Garner (the real life escaped slave who inspired Toni Morrison&#8217;s character, Sethe). And I realized early on precisely what you said: that I couldn&#8217;t judge her. Suppose I knew definitely that my boys, my children, were going to be kidnapped, taken off, molested, what would I do? And I couldn&#8217;t answer. I answered differently depending on what I thought the danger to them was then. I realized there was only one person who was in the position to make that judgment, and that was the dead child.<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> And we do get her perspective in the book.<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes, this is what she thinks. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> And that moment in <em>Beloved</em> in the barn, when Sethe is killing her child, made me think of other mothers and daughters in your novels and these extreme demonstrations of love: the scene where the character Eva, in <em>Sula,</em> sets fire to Plum, but she also jumps out the window to save Hannah, and a scene in <em>A Mercy</em> when a mother gives her child away. &#160;<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes, extreme forms of love. And the thing is, we think of it in romantic way, but I was reminded recently of somebody in a book one of mine, in <em>Sula,</em> when (Hannah) said, 'Did you ever love me?' And her mother said, 'I kept you alive.'</p>
<p><strong>DW:</strong> It&#8217;s love, and it&#8217;s a form of goodness, but there&#8217;s something kind of fierce about it.<br/><br/><strong>TM:&#160;</strong> In that community they didn&#8217;t have anything. They had no water. They were separate from the town. They didn&#8217;t have anything except for themselves, and how they handle one another is the way they live in the world.&#160; I always think these are the people who don&#8217;t necessarily like you but they wont hurt you. They will save your life whether they want to save you or not.<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> The good has a kind of bruising quality.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong>&#160; Yes. That is my way of doing it. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> You&#8217;ve also pointed out narratives that privilege evil, including media narratives, tend to relegate the forces of good to &#8216;freak&#8217; status. At Harvard, in your lecture there in 2012, you talked about the Amish community, which refused to condemn a man for shooting a group of Amish girls, and even reached out to console his widow.<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Yes, and the media twisted it as freakish. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> I think the way you portray good without irony in your books, without that freakishness you just mentioned, would not be at all possible if you wrote from a position of cynicism and despair. <br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Many writers do write from that position. And, you know, think of the suicide rate and the alcoholism. It is high among the writers we adore. Terrible things happen, and the world is sort of chaotic, and there is nothing anyone can do about it except to acknowledge it. Goodness, or some reach for moral clarity, is either (portrayed as) weak or is confined to the sort of scholastic confining world of religious people, you know, very religious people, evangelical people. I am a Catholic so even there it is very strong, and this an aside, but I guess we are seeing the consequences of religion in Syria. (ISIS) just chopped off some kid&#8217;s head &#8211; children! &#8211; and why? Because they didn&#8217;t agree with their system of belief. I know we&#8217;ve had this before, back during the Crusades, but there is something about the merging of evil and its theatrics that troubles me, not just in the world. &#160;I look for it in the place where I&#8217;ve always found wisdom and art, and that is in literature. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> But surely there are times when world events have driven you to despair.<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong>&#160; Let tell you a little anecdote. You&#8217;ll enjoy this. I wrote about this for a magazine.&#160; (In 2004) I was writing something and I couldn&#8217;t (write), and I was feeling very sad, disturbed, I think. Anyway, whatever it was, it was paralyzing, and a friend, Peter Sellars (the opera and theater director who has collaborated with Morrison), called up, as he often does on Christmas Day or something during the holidays, and he is always up and working. He said, 'How are you?', and I said that I didn&#8217;t feel very good. It was sort of a sad time. I said. 'You know, Peter, I can&#8217;t write,' and I told him why I thought I couldn&#8217;t, and he started shouting, "No, no, no, no!' He said this is precisely the time when artists go to work, not when everything is fine but when things were difficult. Dire. This is when we&#8217;re needed &#8230;&#160; God, think of all the writers who wrote in prisons, in gulags, you know. I mean, it is just amazing, so I felt a little ashamed but very happy that he said that. I've never had a problem since.</p>
<p><br/><strong>DW:</strong> You were a humanities professor for many years at Princeton. Considering these students are high powered, and many are going on to positions of great influence and power, &#160;is it the particular responsibility of the humanities professor to use history and literature to teach ethics and moral responsibility?<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> I prefer to think of it as moving (students) toward wisdom.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> How? <br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> By being wise!<br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> I&#8217;m going to end with a broad question for both writers: Is it possible for a book to change the world? <br/><br/><strong>AD:</strong>&#160; Absolutely. I think we would be living in a very different world had we not experienced the impact of Toni Morrison&#8217;s writing. There is no doubt about the extent to which she has influenced the literary world, not only in this country but all over. She has actually changed the face of the planet. And I see her as a person who made a conscious decision to use her literary talent to bring new ideas into the world, to change the world, absolutely. And often that happens more fundamentally, more profoundly, than the change that those of us who work at the political level envision. I don&#8217;t think that our notion of freedom would be what it is without the impact of Toni Morrison. She said that one cannot be free without freeing someone. Freedom is to free someone else. And of course, those of us who do political work, radical political work, always insist on the importance of transcending the single individual and to think about collective processes, and Toni Morrison has done this in her writing. <br/><br/><strong>DW to TM:</strong> Is it possible for books to change the world?<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Some do. They just do. And it&#8217;s sometimes very difficult to get such books published. Think about James Joyce. You can&#8217;t think the same way after you read a certain voice. <br/><br/><strong>DW:</strong> Angela Davis believes this is the case with your books.<br/><br/><strong>TM:</strong> Well, I hope she&#8217;s right. And I&#8217;ve never known Angela to be wrong.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62c7e611807270466b1f05a1746e7c01"><name>open-enrollment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Open Enrollment 2015</title><summary>The annual Open Enrollment (OE) period begins Thursday, October 30 and ends at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, November 25.</summary><start-date>1414652400000</start-date><display-name>Open Enrollment 2015</display-name><path>/2014/10/open-enrollment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/open-enrollment</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1414701508040</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1414702110713</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">The annual Open Enrollment (OE) period begins today (Thursday, October 30) and ends at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, November 25. This is the time of year to review your health and welfare benefits, decide whether to make any changes, and enroll/re-enroll in a flexible spending account. OE Booklets were mailed to home addresses this week (if you haven&#8217;t received a booklet or were hired after August 31 you can contact the campus Benefits Office for a copy). All Open Enrollment information will also be online: start at <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/</a>and follow the links to 2015 Open Enrollment. </span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Given the significant changes last year, the strategy for 2015 was to maintain stability and keep rates as low as possible while providing some enhancements. The same suite of plans available in 2014 will continue in 2015. For all plans other than UC Care, 2015 rate increases will not exceed $25 per month, and most employees will see increases under $15. UC Care increases will range from $25 to $80 per month, but this plan provides the most flexibility in provider choice, including affordable access to UC medical center facilities and providers and locally to Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF). The University will continue to pay the larger share of medical plan costs&#8211;on average 86.6 percent. The general rates can be found online at <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs.html">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs.html</a>. In addition, the University will continue to cover 100% of the premium cost for Vision and Dental plans for employees and dependents.</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"><br/> Some other 2015 plan changes, including several enhancements, are listed below:</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<ul>
<li><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;&#160; Chiropractic and acupuncture benefits available across all plans (details for each plan differ)</span></li>
<li><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;&#160; Maximum out-of-pocket costs for pharmacy benefits added across all plans (details for each plan differ)</span></li>
<li><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;&#160; Over-the-counter nicotine replacement products will be covered at no cost with a prescription (currently $5 co-pay with a prescription)</span></li>
<li><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;&#160; Women&#8217;s Preventative Health will now cover cancer risk reducing medications, such as Tamoxifen or Raloxifene, for women at increased risk with no co-payment</span></li>
<li><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;&#160; 90-day prescription supply option (for 2 co-pays) added to plans at certain walk-in pharmacies (contracted pharmacies vary by medical plan)</span></li>

<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">UC continues to offer several medical plans from which to choose. Each plan provides comprehensive coverage, including behavioral health benefits. But the cost, both in terms of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as provider choice and flexibility to use out-of-network doctors and hospitals, varies significantly.</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Please take time to review your 2015 options and choose the medical plan that best fits your needs. If you have questions or need assistance with your enrollment decisions, consider attending an Open Enrollment presentation.

<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Sobre: Inscripci&#243;n Abierta 2015</span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">&#160;El per&#237;odo anual de Inscripci&#243;n Abierta (<i>Open Enrollment [OE] </i><i>en Ingl&#233;s</i>) comienza hoy (jueves, 30 de octubre) y termina a las 5 de la tarde del martes, 25 de noviembre. Esta es la &#233;poca del a&#241;o para revisar sus beneficios de salud y bienestar, decidir si va a hacer alg&#250;n cambio, e inscribirse/re-inscribirse en una cuenta de gastos flexibles (<i>Flexible Spending Account [FSA] </i><i>en Ingl&#233;s</i>). Los folletos de Inscripci&#243;n Abierta fueron enviados a los domicilios particulares esta semana (si usted no ha recibido el folleto o fue contratado despu&#233;s del 31 de agosto, puede ponerse en contacto con la Oficina de Beneficios del campus para conseguir una copia). Toda la informaci&#243;n sobre la Inscripci&#243;n Abierta estar&#225; tambi&#233;n en l&#237;nea: comience en <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/</a> y siga los enlaces para Inscripci&#243;n Abierta 2015 (<i>2015 Open Enrollment </i><i>en Ingl&#233;s</i>). </span></p>
<span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span>
<p><span face="Verdana" style="font-family: Verdana;">Teniendo en cuenta los cambios significativos del a&#241;o pasado, la estrategia para el 2015 fue mantener estabilidad y mantener las primas mensuales lo m&#225;s bajas posible, al mismo tiempo que proporcionar algunas mejoras. El mismo conjunto de planes disponible en el 2014 continuar&#225; en el 2015. Para todos los planes que no sean UC Care, los aumentos en las primas mensuales para el 2015 no exceder&#225;n $25 por mes, y la mayor&#237;a de los empleados ver&#225;n aumentos por debajo de $15. Los aumentos de UC Care oscilar&#225;n entre $25 y $80 por mes, pero este plan proporciona la mayor flexibilidad en la elecci&#243;n del proveedor, incluyendo acceso asequible a las facilidades y proveedores del los centros m&#233;dicos de la UC, y a nivel local, a la Fundaci&#243;n M&#233;dica de Palo Alto (<i>Palo Alto Medical Foundation [PAMF]</i><i> en Ingl&#233;s</i>). La universidad continuar&#225; pagando la mayor parte de los costos del plan m&#233;dico: un promedio del 86.6 por ciento. Las primas mensuales generales se encuentran en l&#237;nea en <a href="http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs.html">http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/health-plans/medical/employee-plan-costs.html</a>. Adem&#225;s, la universidad continuar&#225; cubriendo el 100% del costo de la prima para los planes de la vista y dental, para los empleados y sus dependientes.</span></p>

Backers of a crowd-funding campaign hope to raise $20,000 to map the banana slug genome for the first time ever.</p>
<p>If the project is fully funded, UC Santa Cruz, which has some of the world's leading genomics experts, will hold a special bioinformatics class in which a select group of graduate students and a few highly motivated undergraduates will peer deeply into the genetic makeup of a slimy creature that embodies the campus's creative and countercultural mindset.</p>
<p>The project has an obvious whimsical, crowd-pleasing aspect. After all, the genome mapping effort focuses on a mascot that has embodied UC Santa Cruz's eccentric and defiant spirit for the past 27 years, when the slug defeated the sea lion in a bid to represent the campus.</p>
<p>But it's also serious science.</p>
<p>"This means we can learn a lot about the biology of banana slugs," said Richard "Ed" Green, assistant professor in biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz and an internationally recognized genomics expert. "This would be a great opportunity for students to learn the technology of getting DNA, turning it into a sequencing library, and using a computer to assemble the complete genome sequence."</p>
<p>The banana slug would be the first terrestrial slug to have its genome mapped, said Jan Leonard, research associate at the UC Santa Cruz Institute of Marine Sciences and a renowned banana slug expert.</p>
<p>"I'm really excited about this," Leonard said. "We have this random little animal as a mascot, but by doing its genome you are getting a real opportunity to advance our understanding of evolution by comparing it to closely related species."</p>
<p>Eight species of banana slug can be found between Alaska and San Diego, but the genome project will focus specifically on the species that resides in the forests of UC Santa Cruz and environs: <i>Ariolimax dolichophallus</i>.</p>
<p>If the crowdfunding project succeeds, Ed Green and UC Santa Cruz professor of biomolecular engineering Kevin Karplus will teach the class together.</p>
<p>Karplus said the genome mapping is a great teaching opportunity for budding researchers and young scientists because "this is something no one else is doing. It is uncharted territory because there isn't a known answer. We are doing it for real in class and not as an exercise."</p>
<p>The banana slug genome class has been held before, but Karplus said that it was run "on a shoestring" and there simply wasn't enough funding or resources, so the class ended up yielding "snippets" instead of a full genome.</p>
<p>If all goes well, a "draft" version of the genome could be ready as early as this coming spring, Karplus said.</p>
<p>The project is long overdue, considering all other mascots in the University of California system have had their genomes mapped or are in the process, said Branwyn Wagman (Kresge '79), director of development and communications for the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p>
<p>Wagman said the crowdfunding project grew out of a discussion she and some colleagues had during the annual DNA Day and Double Helix Dance on campus in 2013, which included an on-campus science party and 46 dancers performing a loose visual representation of DNA.</p>
<p>Wagman had been hoping to have a poster showing the genome of the banana slug in time for DNA Day. She was joking around about this with her husband, Ken Wagman (Stevenson '78), "and he just seized on it," she recalled. "He asked how much it would cost. We figured we could fund some of it ourselves and get our friends to kick in the rest. And then I thought: why limit this to my friends? Let's get <i>everybody </i>involved."</p>
<p>The Wagmans started the crowdfunding project by offering $5,000. Two other donors -- Leslie Grate, who has a Ph.D. in computer engineering from UC Santa Cruz, and his wife, Lou, a past staff member in the UC Santa Cruz molecular, cellular and developmental biology department and a current lab volunteer in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, stepped forward to pledge an additional $7,500.</p>
<p>This quartet of donors is matching all donations two to one. This means that supporters can put this project &#8216;over the top&#8217; if they can raise an additional $6,250.</p>
<p>Aside from advancing science, the Wagmans hope to attract more attention to the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.</p>

Automated technology can then adjust and control the components of the grid to improve its efficiency and manage the integration of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>The intermittency inherent in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power poses a challenge for electric companies, which must provide a consistent power supply. Smart grid technology could help meet this challenge.</p>
<p><a href="http://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/">Ricardo Sanfelice</a>, an associate professor of computer engineering at UC Santa Cruz, and his students are developing and testing theories about how to control the flow of electricity through a smart grid. &#8220;I have a student writing mathematical equations with one hand and wiring circuits with the other,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To test their theories on a large scale, the researchers will use a smart grid test bed at <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/">Sandia National Laboratories</a> in New Mexico. Sanfelice, who recently moved to UC Santa Cruz from the University of Arizona, said he is also interested in collaborating with local utility companies and other companies working toward the future smart grid.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid systems</strong></p>
<p>The complex dynamical behavior of smart grid systems is partly due to the combination of two kinds of behavior: continuous changes and abrupt jumps in currents and voltages. Sanfelice specializes in understanding and controlling such "hybrid systems" in which continuous and discrete behavior is intertwined. Hybrid systems often involve both analog and digital components or so-called "cyber-physical systems," in which embedded computers and networks monitor and control physical elements or processes.</p>
<p>A simple example of a hybrid system is a thermostat programmed to keep the temperature in a room constant. Changes in temperature occur in a continuous manner, steadily dropping in cold weather, for example, until the temperature drops below the set point. Then a heater kicks on to warm the room, providing an abrupt or discrete change in the system that occurs at irregular intervals as the thermostat switches the heater on and off.</p>
<p>Scientists previously modeled such hybrid systems by treating them mathematically as either continuous or discontinuous systems. But Sanfelice says many problems can only be understood by considering both aspects of a hybrid system.</p>
<p><strong>Aerial robots</strong></p>
<p>The control of flying robots or drones is another area in which Sanfelice applies hybrid systems analysis. When an aerial robot flies inside a building from an outdoor area, it has to make several sudden adjustments. The navigation system, for example, might switch from using GPS outdoors to onboard cameras indoors. The flight system also has to accommodate changes in airflow and pressure as the device moves through a doorway or window into a building.</p>
<p>Sanfelice hopes to expand the robotics applications of his research at UCSC by partnering with robotics companies in the area. His lab will have space to test their computational theories using ground-based and aerial robots in a controlled setting. One of his main interests is in networks of robotic or autonomous systems in which computer algorithms have to make decisions in response to changes in the network.</p>
<p>Sanfelice also sees examples of hybrid systems in nature in areas such as neuroscience, and he&#8217;s hoping to tackle the theory behind these problems as well. Spikes of activity caused by neurons firing together may contribute to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, for example. Using theory to understand that synchronicity could suggest ways to desynchronize the firing, Sanfelice said.</p>
<p><strong>Synchronized fireflies</strong></p>
<p>Another example of a hybrid system found in nature is the synchronized flashing of fireflies. If each firefly has an internal timer that resets each time it flashes and also resets in response to flashes from other fireflies, the light show can begin with flashes from just one or a few fireflies. As others in the group see the light and reset their internal timers, their timers will eventually synchronize, so that all the fireflies flash together.</p>
<p>Sanfelice has worked out mathematical equations to determine when synchronization will happen, how fast it happens, and what happens when new fireflies join the group. Students in his cyber-physical systems class are using those equations to create a &#8220;virtual firefly&#8221; app for mobile phones. Phones with the app installed would communicate with each other so that, once activated, the screens on a few phones randomly light up and, over time, all of the phones flash together.</p>
<p>"This effort is relevant to event-based synchronization in network systems, such as the need to synchronize the time of multiple computers over large data networks," Sanfelice said.</p>
<p>Though he enjoys figuring out the mathematics to describe hybrid systems, Sanfelice also feels it&#8217;s important to use those equations for practical applications. &#8220;I get excited when there&#8217;s a system I can understand and contribute to a problem that is relevant,&#8221; he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="675fceaf807270466b1f05a1324faf67"><name>film-major-ranking</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz named one of the country’s best colleges for film majors </title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has been ranked No. 7 in the country by College Factual for Best Bachelors Program for Film, Video and Photographic Arts.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, best film schools, ucsc film department, ucsc arts division</keywords><start-date>1414779000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz one of best colleges for film majors </display-name><path>/2014/10/film-major-ranking</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/10/film-major-ranking</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1414778572415</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1415645677280</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value><value>About UCSC</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/Deva-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/Deva-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Deva-250.jpg</name><display-name>Deva-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>107001</file-size><width>250</width><height>373</height></image><image-alt>UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media alumna Deva-Blaisdell-Anderson</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/10/images/film-rank-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/10/images/film-rank-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>film-rank-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>film-rank-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>30574</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media alumna Deva-Blaisdell-Anderson</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>UC Santa Cruz Film and Digital Media alumna Deva-Blaisdell-Anderson</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz has been ranked No. 7 in the country by <a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2014/10/29/americas-best-colleges-for-a-major-in-film/"><b><i>College Factual</i></b></a> for Best Bachelors Program for Film, Video and Photographic Arts.</p>
