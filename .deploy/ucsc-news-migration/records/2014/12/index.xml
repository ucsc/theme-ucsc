The devastating impact of this disease is due in part to the seasonal dynamics of infection and transmission, according to a new study led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz and published December 3 in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>.</p>
<p>The researchers were surprised to discover that during the winter, when the bats are hibernating, the fungus can infect nearly every bat in a colony. Bats that survive the winter are able to clear the infection during summer when their body temperatures are above the growth limit of the fungus. But the remarkably high rate of infection during hibernation leads to high mortality rates at the time of year when bat populations are naturally at their lowest, before the females give birth in the summer.</p>
<p>"It hits when the population is at its smallest, and by the end of winter nearly 100 percent of the bats in a cave can be infected, which helps explain why it has such large impacts," said Kate Langwig, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and first author of the paper.</p>
<p>The study provides the first description of the dynamics of fungal infection and transmission in bats, and the findings are in striking contrast to most infectious diseases, said senior author Marm Kilpatrick, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"For many diseases, population density and social interactions play a big role in transmission, but these bats are actually very social and live in dense colonies in both summer and winter," he said. "In this case, transmission is tied to hibernation and body temperature. When the bats start hibernating, it's almost like they become petri dishes for this fungus to grow on."</p>
<p><strong>Hibernation</strong></p>
<p>The fungus <i>(Pseudogymnoascus destructans)</i> thrives in cold environments and grows superficially on exposed skin on the bats' noses, ears, and wings. During hibernation, the body temperatures of bats drop to the cold ambient temperatures of their "hibernacula" (the caves and abandoned mines where the bats hibernate). The fungus proliferates at these temperatures, which range from 2 to 12 degrees Celsius (35 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit). Over the course of the winter hibernation period, which can last more than five months, the infection spreads throughout the colony and on individual bats. Most of the mortality is in late winter, when both infection prevalence (the number of infected bats) and infection loads (the amount of fungus on individual bats) are highest.</p>
<p>"The peak load in late winter is probably what's driving mortality," Langwig said. "Bats that survive the winter can clear the fungal infection once they warm up, so that by mid-summer, when the young of the year are born, almost no bats are infected any more."</p>
<p>The researchers studied six species of bats, testing them for infection with the fungus during three key periods of their annual cycle: fall, when the bats mate outside the hibernacula; winter, when they go into hibernation; and summer, when they migrate to maternity sites and the females give birth.</p>
<p>The researchers began to detect low levels of fungal infection in the fall, probably as a result of bats coming in contact with spores of the fungus inside the hibernacula. "The bats are still active then, so the infections are at a very low level and don't appear to be growing. But as soon as they go into hibernation and their body temperature drops, the infections ramp up really quickly," Langwig said. &#160;</p>
<p>The fact that bats are not transmitting the infection during the migratory period is important in limiting the rate at which it is spreading geographically, she added, noting that West Nile virus--which, like white-nose syndrome, was first detected in New York state--spread rapidly throughout most of North America because birds are infected during migration.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Management strategies</strong></p>
<p>The study provides valuable information for planning strategies to manage white-nose syndrome. If scientists can develop an effective treatment, for example, this study indicates that the best time to apply it would probably be early winter, Langwig said. Kilpatrick and coauthor Winifred Frick, an adjunct professor of biology at UC Santa Cruz, are leading efforts to develop a "probiotic" treatment using bacteria to suppress the growth of the fungus. The researchers have isolated several bacterial species that occur naturally on bats and are measuring their ability to suppress the fungus in laboratory tests. Then they plan to use the most promising bacteria as a treatment to see if it can help bats survive through the winter.</p>
<p>"The idea would be to apply the bacteria on bats during hibernation and see if it suppresses the growth of the fungus," Kilpatrick said.</p>
<p>In addition to Langwig, Frick, and Kilpatrick, the coauthors of the paper include Joseph Hoyt and Tina Cheng at UC Santa Cruz; Rick Reynolds of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries; Katy Parise, Kevin Drees, and Thomas Kunz of Boston University; and Jeffrey Foster of Northern Arizona University and the University of New Hampshire.

<p>I can&#8217;t believe the end of fall quarter is almost here. Finals are right around the corner.&#160; As we approach this very busy season, I want to remind you to take care of your physical and mental health, and offer some tips on managing stress.</p>
<p>The essential first step is to get organized. Write down all the things you have to do to prepare for exams. If you feel there's too much to do right away, work out priorities for your assignments, then follow these helpful tips from <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a>.</p>
<p>1. Try using written lists, a day planner, or a calendar to organize your classes, homework, study time, exams, and time for "self-care." It's important to eat, sleep, exercise, and relax!</p>
<p>2.&#160; Set daily goals for studying, but be realistic. We are not machines, after all.</p>
<p>3. &#160;Give yourself credit for the work you're getting done.</p>
<p>4. Don't allow yourself to slip into self-defeating habits, such as procrastinating. Try to keep your momentum going. Break up blocks of study with short breaks to limit fatigue. If you study solidly for a couple of hours, make sure you give yourself a break before you start up again.</p>
<p>5. Practice relaxation in your daily life. Simple techniques, such as breathing exercises and mindfulness meditation, can help you feel calm and more focused.</p>
<p>6.&#160; Don&#8217;t let exam stress get in the way of a lifestyle that is healthy and conducive to effective study. Health and well-being boils down to these essential steps:</p>
<p>&#8226; Eat regular nutritious meals, including fruit, vegetables, and protein. Minimize junk food.</p>
<p>&#8226; Try to maintain a good sleep routine, going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Most people do not benefit from all-nighters. Factor some exercise into your routine each day; walking is good.</p>
<p>&#8226; Cut down on caffeine; don&#8217;t rely on alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>&#8226; Practice a relaxation exercise at least once a day. Also, think of other things you find relaxing&#8212;maybe listening to music, taking a hot shower, making art, watching videos, or talking to a friend. Relaxation exercises and other ways to manage stress will work best if you practice them regularly&#8212;not just when you&#8217;re already super stressed. Even a few minutes a day is good!</p>
<p>&#8226; Each morning when you get up, try to have a realistic plan for the day. Allow yourself to feel good at the end of the day about what you achieved.</p>
<p>&#8226; Think positively when you wake up. It helps a lot if you can approach the start of each day in a positive way. One technique is to think of three things you feel grateful for; another is to visualize the positive behaviors you will engage in throughout the day.</p>
<p>And remember, if you feel overwhelmed and need support, don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, college staff, or <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services</a>.</p>
<p>Good luck with finals, and happy holidays! &#160;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

It follows the installation last February of zero-waste stations at the Humanities 1 building.&#160; If the pilot proves successful additional stations will be established at other campus buildings. <br/><br/>The project was made possible through a collaboration among UC Santa Cruz Grounds Services, Custodial Services and the Sustainability Office.<br/><br/>Key to the project&#8217;s success is the care users take to separate their materials, said Elida Erickson, sustainability programs manager in the UC Santa Cruz Sustainability Office.&#160; &#8220;It's extremely important for users to look at the signs on the bins and make sure they are placing their items in the correct bin, to prevent &#8216;contamination&#8217; of material streams.<br/><br/>&#8220;Those extra few seconds to make sure you&#8217;re choosing the right bin can make all the difference,&#8221; Erickson said.<br/><br/>Chancellor Blumenthal has committed the campus to attain the UC president&#8217;s goal of reaching zero waste by the end of the decade. Zero waste means diverting all waste from landfills. For 2013-2014, 63 percent of UC waste was diverted away from landfills. <br/><br/>Christian Monzon, a junior majoring in environmental studies and ecology and evolutionary biology, is the McHenry Zero Waste Pilot project coordinator. He said he hopes UC Santa Cruz will become the first zero waste campus in California, setting an example for other UCs.<br/><br/>He agrees that the sorting process is key and can be confusing. "I think that students and campus users have the desire to properly sort and dispose of their waste but it can often be confusing, especially since our waste collection is fairly inconsistent across campus,&#8221; Monzon said. <br/><br/>One of the largest portions of waste on campus is compostable material, such as food scraps, used paper towels, and Bioware cups, plates, and utensils that shouldn&#8217;t go to a landfill. However, no campus-wide composing solution exists yet.&#160; The McHenry Library pilot program integrates compost into the waste stream, with the goal of eventually phasing composting into more campus locations.<br/><br/>Besides four floors of Humanities 1 and McHenry Library, compost bins are all dining halls and the Owl&#8217;s Nest caf&#233; at Kresge.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="083726f180727046319bcae177820c05"><name>principles-of-community</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Principles of Community Campaign begins Friday with event at Kresge</title><summary>The first in a year-long series of events exploring how to put the UC Santa Cruz Principles of Community into practice is scheduled for Friday, December 5 from noon to 1 p.m. at the Kresge Town Hall.  </summary><start-date>1417476540000</start-date><display-name>Principles of Community Campaign</display-name><path>/2014/12/principles-of-community</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/principles-of-community</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1417477039765</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1417477236711</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The first in a year-long series of events exploring how to put the UC Santa Cruz Principles of Community into practice is scheduled for Friday, December 5 from noon to 1 p.m. at the Kresge Town Hall.&#160; Refreshments will be provided. <br/><br/>The event is part of the <a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/2681">UC Santa Cruz Principles of Community Campaign</a>.

The drive runs between Thanksgiving weekend and the winter break.</p>
<p>One in four children in our county are going without enough meals. &#160;We know that this can have a very tangible impact on their social and educational development as well as their long-term health. The people who need calories the most often get the lowest quality ones available as determined by price. That is why we are honored to work with Second Harvest Food Bank, the healthiest food bank in the nation. Second harvest distributes over 65 percent of their meals in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables while at the same time educating their clients on how to eat smart.</p>
<p>Last year the UCSC holiday food drive raised more than 150,000 meals for our friends and neighbors in need, making the campus the third largest contributor in the county.</p>
<p>Please make a donation to support this great cause, either in one of our campus pantry barrels or by using the donation envelopes distributed through campus mail. Just one dollar provides healthy meals with a much lower carbon footprint than pantry donations.</p>
<p>Your donations are secure through campus mail services. Donation envelopes are being distributed this week. Please make checks payable to Second Harvest Food Bank and mark your affiliation on the memo line.</p>
<p>Please keep an eye out for this year&#8217;s raffle.</p>

Finding a spot in a professor's lab can be challenging, however, so Jocic created her own research experience. She co-founded <a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:UCSC">a team of UCSC undergraduates</a> to compete in an international synthetic biology competition.</p>
<p>"Synthetic biology is the idea that you're engineering life," said Rolando Perez, a senior in biomolecular engineering and the other co-founder of the team. "You're harnessing nature to do things nature's never done before."</p>
<p>The <a href="http://igem.org/Main_Page">International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM)</a> competition challenges students to use the techniques of molecular biology to build novel biological systems and operate them in living cells. The UC Santa Cruz team worked to engineer a microbe to produce biofuel from processed plant material. Six of the 14 team members, including Jocic, recently returned from Boston, where their project won a bronze medal in the 2014 iGEM competition (one of 59 bronze medals awarded).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/dbernick">David Bernick</a>, a lecturer and researcher in biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, served as the team's faculty mentor. Bernick said biofuels can play a role in slowing climate change as one component of a carbon-neutral energy system. In theory, the carbon dioxide released when biofuels are burned would be offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed during growth of the plants used as raw materials.</p>
<p><strong>Butanol</strong></p>
<p>The UCSC team's goal was to engineer a microbe to produce butanol, an alcohol that can be used as biofuel, from cellulose, the main component of plant cell walls. Other scientists have engineered bacteria to produce biofuels, because they grow quickly and their genetics are easily altered to create new functions. High salt concentrations can be used to strip cellulose from plant matter, but then any microbes used to convert the cellulose into biofuel would have to be able to tolerate high salt concentrations.</p>
<p>The UCSC team decided to start with a microbe that already prefers growing in salty conditions--a type of archaean (a separate branch of life from bacteria). Archaeans are simple microbes that include inhabitants of some of the most extreme environments on Earth. The students worked with a species called <i>Haloferax volcanii</i> that lives in high salt environments.</p>
<p>The students modified their archaean's genome to interrupt the metabolic pathways used to make long hydrocarbon chains on fats. They wanted to preemptively interrupt that pathway so that it only produces the 4-carbon chain needed to make butanol.</p>
<p>The team identified seven genes that could be involved with the pathway they wanted to change. Last summer, they created two engineered microbes, each with a different one of those seven possibilities silenced. The researchers know their changes altered the proper pathway, but they haven't yet tested the microbes to see if either one accumulates butyrate, a precursor of the desired biofuel.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;iGEM Course</strong></p>
<p>Some of the team members are currently continuing to work on the project, Bernick said. He is currently creating a course to extend the iGEM experience to another group of 12 students each summer. The new course would be another way for undergraduates in biomolecular engineering to fulfill the capstone requirements for their degree.</p>
<p>"One of the biggest limitations facing science majors is getting into a lab and having research experience," Bernick said. He hopes this new course will give more students an opportunity to work in a lab and design research.</p>
<p>Bernick noted that the students were the core drivers of this project. Jocic and Perez approached him with the idea to form an iGEM team composed of students from a variety of majors and backgrounds. All the undergraduate researchers, faculty mentors, and graduate student advisors were unpaid volunteers. The team paid for their lab work and trip to Boston with crowd-funded donations, and also received support from the Baskin School of Engineering and the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.</p>
<p>"It's remarkable what happens when you have resources, an idea, and a group of dedicated students interested in digging in," Bernick said. "All of these students, in their own ways, are exceptional."</p>
<p>The team included a group of humanities undergraduates who investigated ethical questions inherent to synthetic biology projects. Some of those questions included environmental safety should an engineered organism escape the lab, as well as larger questions about social responsibility for global energy use. Bioethicist Sandra Dreisbach, a lecturer in philosophy and biomolecular engineering departments, mentored these students.</p>
<p>In addition to Jocic and Perez, other UC Santa Cruz students on the team included: Christopher Lee, Dominic Schenone, Stas Fridland, Saumya Singh, Maximilian Genetti, Kevin Josef Sweeney, Mary Lenore Pafford, Vinay Chaitanya Poodari, Kaylee Walker, Wade Dugdale, and Paige Welsh. The ethics group included UCSC undergraduates&#160;Breeann MacDonald,&#160;Manuel Avalos, and Matthew Waldron. Team member Jazel Hernandez currently attends Hartnell College in Salinas and plans to transfer to UC Santa Cruz in 2015. Graduate student advisors were Jeff Nivala, Hosein Amiri, Logan Mulroney, Charles Paine, and James Sutter.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="115b038b80727046319bcae114c3da88"><name>kast-spectrograph</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Lick Observatory plans major upgrade for Shane Telescope</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz received $350,000 in grant and donor funds for an upgrade of the Kast Spectrograph, a crucial instrument for UC astronomers.</summary><keywords>Kast Spectrograph, Lick Observatory, Shane Telescope</keywords><start-date>1417593600000</start-date><display-name>Lick Observatory plans major upgrade for Shane Telescope</display-name><path>/2014/12/kast-spectrograph</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/kast-spectrograph</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1417630384946</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1417647509714</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Donor News</value><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Hilary Lebow</name><title></title><phone/><email>lebow@ucolick.org</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/kast-spec-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/kast-spec-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kast-spec-400.jpg</name><display-name>kast-spec-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>90737</file-size><width>400</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Kast Spectrograph under construction</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/kast-spec-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/kast-spec-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kast-spec-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>kast-spec-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23783</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Kast Spectrograph</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The Kast Spectrograph was originally designed by UC Santa Cruz astronomer Joseph Miller and built in the Lick Observatory shops at UCSC.

<p>Astronomers throughout the UC system use the Kast Spectrograph for scientific research across a broad range of observational programs. Its powerful and flexible double-camera design makes it the most important and most used instrument on the 3-meter Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory, located on Mount Hamilton east of San Jose.</p>
<p>Bill and Marina Kast, the donors for whom the instrument is named, initiated the current upgrade program with a $50,000 donation announced in early 2014. Major funding for the upgrade was provided by a $300,000 grant from the Heising-Simons Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this award, we will be bringing the Kast up to the standards of the best observatories in the world,&#8221; said Brad Holden, a research astronomer at UC Santa Cruz and principal investigator for the Kast upgrade project. &#8220;We will be able to make observations that can currently only be done at a handful of places.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Black holes and supernovae</strong></p>
<p>The spectrograph is used to analyze faint celestial objects at distances ranging from our own solar system to the far reaches of the universe. Astronomers research the chemical composition of stars, probe the surroundings of massive black holes, and study massive intergalactic hydrogen clouds, among other projects.</p>
<p>Alex Filippenko, professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley, said the Kast Spectograph is crucial for his team&#8217;s long-term study of supernovae, or exploding stars. &#8220;The Kast spectrograph is unique at Lick Observatory,&#8221; said Filippenko. &#8220;It allows astronomers to obtain spectra of objects over the complete optical range, from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spectrograph itself is two distinct instruments. Separate CCD detectors analyze and record wavelengths in the blue and red ranges independently and at the same time. The blue and red spectra are then combined to form a spectrum that covers the entire visible wavelength band, giving astronomers a more complete view of distant objects.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the UC Observatories instrument labs at UC Santa Cruz will modernize the red detector to make it as sensitive and powerful as the blue side of the spectrograph.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the upgraded red side of the Kast spectrograph, our data will be even better,&#8221; said Filippenko, who played a major role in securing both the grant and private donation. &#8220;For example, we will be able to more accurately calibrate supernovae in our quest to understand the nature of the dark energy that is accelerating the expansion of the universe."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;City lights</strong></p>
<p>The new red-side detector will also have properties that allow for more accurate removal of light from the city lights of the Santa Clara valley. Up on Mount Hamilton, 16 miles east of San Jose, the emission of nearby city lights can occasionally dilute the view through the telescopes. With greatly improved sensitivity at redder wavelengths, the upgrade will help astronomers probe deeper into the distant universe and observe it as it appeared at earlier times.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Kast was first designed and built in the early 1990s, it was right at the cutting edge in spectrometer efficiency and precision,&#8221; said Michael Bolte, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz who helped to secure the grant. &#8220;Although we have made a number of improvements to continually modernize the instrument, the work funded by the Kasts and Heising-Simons Foundation will allow us to bring the instrument right to the world-leading forefront again. This is wonderful news for UC astronomers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Heising-Simons Foundation was established in 2007 by Mark Heising and Elizabeth Simons to advance sustainable solutions in the environment, enhance the education of young learners, and support groundbreaking research in science. News of the secured funds for the upgrade project comes just after UC announced their continued support of Lick Observatory at the end of October.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is more great news for Lick Observatory,&#8221; said Claire Max, interim director of UC Observatories. &#8220;This upgrade will help keep Lick Observatory at the forefront of astronomical surveys and research for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Observatories is the system-wide astronomical research unit that operates Lick Observatory, as well as the technical labs at UC Santa Cruz and UCLA, and acts as one of the managing partners of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. UCO is also the center for the UC participation in the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project, now under construction in Hawaii.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an exciting time to bring new projects aboard,&#8221; said Max. &#8220;Our expert staff at the instrument labs will continue to push the envelope with next generation technology for Keck, the Thirty Meter Telescope, and now Lick Observatory.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="16bf8d0180727046319bcae14bfeb4ef"><name>phased-retirement-program</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Renewal of the Phased Retirement Program</title><summary>The University is renewing the Phased Retirement Program, which provides eligible career staff the opportunity to transition into retirement by voluntarily reducing work hours by at least 10 percent a year for up to three years before retiring. </summary><start-date>1417680000000</start-date><display-name>Renewal of the Phased Retirement Program</display-name><path>/2014/12/phased-retirement-program</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/phased-retirement-program</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1417720859788</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1417721111425</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The University is renewing the Phased Retirement Program, which provides eligible career staff the opportunity to transition into retirement by voluntarily reducing work hours by at least 10 percent a year for up to three years before retiring.

<p>The robotics competition is the final project for students in the <i>Introduction to Mechatronics</i> class taught by Gabriel Elkaim, professor of computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering. Every year, Elkaim comes up with a different challenge for his students. The project gives students an opportunity to apply all the knowledge and skills they have learned in the class to solve an open-ended problem.</p>
<p>The students work in teams to build a "droid" or robot that can operate autonomously, with no help from the students once the game starts. This year's competition is called "Game of Drones: A Clash of Slugs." The task requires students to build robots that can navigate the field of play, infiltrate the castle of the reigning monarch, and bring the "crown" back to their home castle. In each round of the tournament, two teams will compete as rival castles both trying to steal the crown from the ruling castle.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>12-13-2014</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1c19c92180727046319bcae130918115"><name>rich-film-society</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz professor honored by San Francisco Film Society</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz arts professor B.

Now Griggs has published the columns as a book, <i><a href="https://www.createspace.com/4981979">Our Ocean Backyard: Collected Essays</a>. </i></p>
<p>For the three billion people on Earth who live in coastal regions, the ocean is figuratively, if not literally, their backyard. The oceans enrich our lives in countless ways, but our interactions with them have not always been positive, Griggs said.</p>
<p>"Our Ocean Backyard" is a popular weekly feature in the local newspaper. Griggs writes the column every other week, alternating with Dan Haifley, executive director of O'Neill Sea Odyssey.</p>
<p>The new book is a collection of the first six-and-a-half years of Griggs's short essays, which cover ocean exploration, natural disasters, marine life, the natural and geologic history of the Monterey Bay region, waves and beaches, energy and water, and climate change and sea-level rise. Griggs writes not to advocate, but rather to illuminate. His goal is always to explain the science, which in turn enhances people's enjoyment of the ocean and empowers them to make considered, informed decisions.</p>
<p>"I marvel at Gary's ability to relate more complex situations in an understandable form for lay people, and in a way that holds their interest. It is obvious why he has been a successful and much-loved teacher for over four decades," said John Laird, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency and a UC Santa Cruz alumnus.</p>

<p>&#8220;The story is about a woman who finds herself in her childhood home, now inhabited by beasts,&#8221; notes McKenzie.</p>
<p>&#8220;While at first she enjoys the beasts&#8217; kindness and generosity, the story takes a disturbing turn and she finds herself accompanying the beasts on the equivalent of a death march.&#8221;</p>
<p>McKenzie received her B.A. in Literature from UC Santa Cruz in 1981. She taught on campus as a Kresge lecturer from 2008 to 2010.</p>
<p>She is also the author of <i>Stop That Girl</i>, a collection of short stories (dubbed &#8220;anti-fairy tales&#8221; by NPR) that was published in 2006 by Random House, short-listed for The Story Prize, and was a <i>Newsday</i> and <i>Library Journa</i>l &#8220;Best Book of the Year.&#8221;</p>
<p>McKenzie has received a Pushcart Prize for her short fiction, and had a story chosen by Dave Eggers for his anthology <i>Best American Nonrequired Reading</i>.</p>
<p>Her work has also appeared in the <em>Atlantic</em> magazine and been recorded for NPR's <i>Selected Shorts</i>.</p>
<p>McKenzie&#8217;s debut novel <i>MacGregor Tells the World,</i> additionally won acclaim as a <i>Chicago Tribune</i> &#8220;Best Book of the Year,&#8221; and a <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> &#8220;Notable Book.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she is currently at work on a new novel, <i>The Portable Veblen</i>, about a young woman in California who is engaged to an ambitious neurologist. It&#8217;s an unusual love story--the couple&#8217;s quirky families enter the mix, as well as a family of squirrels and the memory of 19th century economist Thorstein Veblen.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/09/mckenzie-atlantic-fiction.html</url><title>Someone I'd Like You to Meet…</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2bc49c8c80727046319bcae173c7b0c8"><name>herbicide-younger-lagoon</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Herbicide application at Younger Lagoon Reserve terrace lands     </title><summary>UCSC Natural Reserves and UCSC Grounds Services to Conduct Herbicide Application at Younger Lagoon reserve terrace Lands.</summary><start-date>1418025600000</start-date><display-name>Herbicide application at Younger Lagoon Reserve terrace lands   </display-name><path>/2014/12/herbicide-younger-lagoon</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/herbicide-younger-lagoon</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1418073513050</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1418073723233</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Beginning Friday December 12, 2014 (weather permitting) there will be an application of herbicide (Glyphosate Pro) at the Southern end of Younger Lagoon Reserve Terrace Lands adjacent to the UCSC Long Marine Lab and Seymour Marine Discovery Center.

Our work is governed by a multitude of policies, laws, and regulations. These exist to protect our university resources and our campus community, and we must ensure we operate with the highest of ethical standards.</p>
<p>However, it is critical that we identify non-value-added requirements and processes&#8212;steps that do not reduce risk, are cumbersome, and sometimes even add confusion and error.</p>
<p>During the 2013-14 academic year, the Business and Administrative Services (BAS) division undertook the development of a new operational ethos. Over time, this framework became known as "Stewardship as our Guidepost and Simplification as a Value." To learn more, you can access the BAS initiative webpage at: <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/bas-initiatives%20/index.html">http://bas.ucsc.edu/bas-initiatives%20/index.html</a></p>
<p>Eight "must statements" emerged that shape this new way of looking at operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>We must put a value on the cost of time</li>
<li>We must review where our team members can best spend their time in supporting the mission of the campus</li>
<li>We must include our clients in the solution-development process</li>
<li>We must understand the original intent of processes and policies</li>
<li>We must ask if steps in the process truly are value-added</li>
<li>We must ensure we have reviewed our interpretation of UC policy</li>
<li>We must avoid one-off tools</li>
<li>We must look at the policy implementation and processes at other UC campuses</li>
</ul>
<p>In the spring of 2014, we identified our top priorities. For externally facing processes that span multiple units and involve multiple policies, we created a Solution Development Team (SDT). SDTs consist of colleagues from multiple units (both inside and outside BAS) who are charged with recommending process changes. Earlier this quarter, four SDTs were charged in the areas of travel, recruitment, procurement, and the entertainment reporting form (ERF).</p>
<p>Positive reinforcement is key to changing the culture of an institution, and this year we introduced annual BAS simplification awards. Fifteen team members have been recognized for their efforts to simplify processes in our division. We have also provided change-management training for more than 150 of our BAS team members to support them as they undertake adaptive changes in their operations.</p>
<p>Here are a few simplification highlights from year one:</p>
<ul>
<li>We revised the cumbersome multi-step Animal Care and Use Occupational Health Program medical clearance process to reduce the number of administrative steps required to clear personnel for work with animals. This is a critical advancement in our ability to support the research mission of UC Santa Cruz.</li>
<li>We eliminated a burdensome one-off business process for hiring temporary staff and replaced it with a system that uses standard CruzBuy processes.</li>
<li>We implemented a new package-delivery program for residential students, eliminating a cumbersome paper-based process. With nearly 200 packages delivered daily during peak times, the new process has cut down delivery time by more than 50 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of our simplification work thus far has involved complex processes that impact multiple units and are governed by multiple policies. However, we are always looking for "quick wins"&#8212;changes that can be made quickly and easily. If you have an idea for such a win, please share it with us on our Quick Win <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/hHPF1i7KvL">portal</a>.</p>
<p>We are in the midst of conducting this year&#8217;s process roundtables, interviews, and surveys to identify priorities for 2015. &#160;I hope you will engage with us as we work to optimize operations.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3021d33180727046319bcae183b44c55"><name>volunteer-profile-phan</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Volunteer profile: Yen Phan</title><summary>"I still feel connected with UC Santa Cruz even though I graduated over 10 years ago and moved to an island thousands of miles away," says volunteer Yen Phan. </summary><keywords>Yen Phan, alumni volunteer</keywords><start-date>1418112000000</start-date><display-name>Volunteer profile: Yen Phan</display-name><path>/2014/12/volunteer-profile-phan</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/volunteer-profile-phan</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1418146730741</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1421775469129</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Volunteer Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/phan-yen-small.JPG</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/phan-yen-small.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>phan-yen-small.JPG</name><display-name>phan-yen-small.JPG</display-name><file-size>96213</file-size><width>300</width><height>225</height></image><image-alt>"I still feel connected with UC Santa Cruz even though I graduated over 10 years ago and m</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/phan-yen-thumb.JPG</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/phan-yen-thumb.JPG</link><site>news</site><name>phan-yen-thumb.JPG</name><display-name>phan-yen-thumb.JPG</display-name><file-size>31640</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>"I still feel connected with UC Santa Cruz even though I graduated over 10 years ago and moved to an island thousands of miles away," says volunteer Yen Phan.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><em>Oakes '01, art and econ</em></p>

<h3>Why do you volunteer with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>I was looking for a UC Santa Cruz alumni network in Hawaii, hoping to connect with other Banana Slugs. There wasn't one, so I started the Hawaii Banana Slugs Group on Facebook, hoping to connect alumni and ohana (family) with Hawaii ties. It was over three years ago, March 2011, with the idea to "talk story, network, have potlucks, participate in community events, fundraise, support the school, and continue our ties with UC Santa Cruz and with each other." We've had a few social gatherings and recruiting events thanks to the help of Ebony Lewis, the Associate Director of Admissions.</p>
<h3>What types of things do you do as a slug volunteer?</h3>
<p>I'm an event planner and organizer, and I love bringing people together for various functions. I send out communications regarding UC Santa Cruz-sponsored events, or pau hana (happy hours) among the alumni. I also help with the booth at recruiting fairs, talking to the potential students and parents about the UC Santa Cruz experience. I also share UC Santa Cruz updates and general information that may be of interest to the Hawaii Banana Slugs Facebook Group.</p>
<h3>What has been the most rewarding thing about volunteering with your alma mater?</h3>
<p>I still feel connected with UC Santa Cruz even though I graduated over 10 years ago and moved to an island thousands of miles away. That whole experience of going to college built me and stayed with me. I also met some really good friends for life there. When I'm talking to potential high school students and parents, I want to share with them the amazing learning and growing experience I had attending college there. I hope that they will choose UC Santa Cruz and have the same or even better experience.</p>
<h3>Words of advice for those thinking of volunteering with UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>It's a great experience. You get to meet new people, catch up with alumni friends, and have a small community that can relate to all things UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3>What's your best memory from your time at UC Santa Cruz?</h3>
<p>Gosh, there are so many. The naked running during the first rain of the year (I didn't participate, but just hearing about it makes the school and people unique). The trips to the late-night dining hall to help with pulling all-nighters. The fun socials put on by the Residential Assistants (RA) for the students living in the dorms. My first time eating mochi ice cream during a special themed dining hall event and ate about 20+ mochis, on top of the huge buffet dinner. The best memory of all is making lifelong friends during my time there and with the Hawaii Banana Slugs.&#160;&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page type="page"><content></content><path>/2014/10/volunteer-profile-madrid</path><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Volunteer Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><link>site://news/2014/10/volunteer-profile-madrid</link><site>news</site><name>volunteer-profile-madrid</name><display-name>Volunteer profile: John Madrid</display-name><title>Volunteer profile: John Madrid</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz was and still is a magical place for me.

Their proposal to establish a UC-wide <a href="http://iseeci.ucnrs.org/">Institute for the Study of Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts</a> (ISEECI) has received $1.9 million in funding, the largest of the new President's Research Catalyst Awards announced by UC President Janet Napolitano on December 10.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz biologist Barry Sinervo will lead the institute, which involves all of UC's nine undergraduate campuses. The NRS is the world's largest system of university-administered natural reserves, offering a powerful opportunity for scientists to study how climate change will affect California ecosystems and the ecosystem services that people rely on, he said.</p>
<p>"We are going to be creating a large network of UC climate researchers and using the NRS system as a climate change observatory for biotic systems," said Sinervo, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who has led studies documenting the effects of climate change on animal populations around the world. He worked with Laurel Fox, also a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, to develop the proposal.</p>
<p>"Working simultaneously across the network of reserves creates much greater returns than the sum of the individual parts," Fox said. "Beyond studying the responses of different habitats in California to environmental change, we can now explore the linkages between them at large spatial scales, with the goal of understanding and potentially mitigating future climate impacts on a state-wide level."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Coordinated approach</strong></p>
<p>ISEECI researchers will assemble historical records, establish a new system for data collection, and conduct experiments and long-term monitoring studies across the state. Although there have been many in-depth studies documenting climate impacts, they have largely been done independently, with results that are difficult to compare among studies. ISEECI will pursue a coordinated approach across broad geographic scales. Researchers will develop models to predict future changes to ecosystems and potential impacts on ecosystem services that might threaten the capacity of Californians to adapt to a changing climate.</p>
<p>"A new approach to research is needed to assess the scope of biotic changes, to devise suitable conservation and restoration responses, and to advise policymakers and the public on how to adapt to and mitigate potential threats to natural ecosystems, agriculture, water resources and sustainable development," Sinervo said. "For Californians, the most important product will be a better understanding of how we can adapt in the face of shifts in critical ecosystem services."</p>
<p>The NRS offers secure study sites where long-term research and experiments can be undertaken by UC faculty and students. The system has many unique features that are unavailable at other reserves or national parks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>proximity to a diverse and ecologically-sophisticated population of university students, volunteer naturalists, docents, and local educators who can engage citizen-scientists and education programs;</li>
<li>availability of local meteorological stations currently recording high-resolution climate data;</li>
<li>ability to sample and archive datasets that can be made available online for public access and analysis; and</li>
<li>collective representation of the range of terrestrial and near-shore marine ecological zones of California.</li>
</ul>
<p>ISEECI is one of five newly funded projects designed to stimulate UC research in areas that could benefit California and the world. The President's Research Catalyst Awards will channel $10 million over three years to fund research in areas of strategic importance, such as sustainability and climate, food and nutrition, equity and social justice, education innovation, and health care.</p>
<p>"The President's Research Catalyst Awards will spur UC research and offer our faculty and students new opportunities for cross-campus, multi-disciplinary collaboration," Napolitano said. "We want to support research endeavors that have real-world impact in areas with critical needs."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-president-announces-10-million-research-awards-initiative-first-group-recipients</url><title>UC

of the University of California'</article-subhead><article-text><p>When Todd Newberry arrived in 1965 to teach biology at the new UC Santa Cruz campus, he stopped at the first important-looking building he saw on High Street. It turned out to be a Congregational Church.</p>
<p>He kept driving, crossing a cattle guard and passing a collection of rundown ranch buildings. "I thought: 'This is it? My God,'" Newberry remembered.</p>
<p>That introduction to the UC system's fledgling university may have been a bit unsettling for the newly hired professor but, in a way, it was also symbolic of what UC Santa Cruz was: an unconventional place that pushed against the stodginess of educational institutions, a place where innovation&#8212;no matter how messy&#8212;was part of the campus's DNA.</p>
<p>It was, as then-UC President Clark Kerr said, "the most significant educational experiment in the history of the University of California."</p>
<h3>Rage against the machine</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz was born, along with UC Irvine and UC San Diego, as the answer to California's post-war baby boom, which was expected to flood the UC system with 215,000 students by the year 2000&#8212;four times the enrollment in 1961.</p>
<p>The campus's location on a scenic sweep of coastal meadow and forest was chosen in March 1961 not only for its staggering beauty but also for its ease of acquisition and the fact its owner, the Cowell Foundation, was willing to donate back a good chunk of the $2 million price tag. The frank and practical Dean McHenry, then UC dean of academic planning, was named chancellor of the new campus a short time later.</p>
<p>Kerr wanted each of the three new campuses to have their own identities and, with his choice of McHenry, cemented the notion that UC Santa Cruz would become a statement against the rise of the large, impersonal, and inflexible university&#8212;a concern both men shared.</p>
<p>Using Oxford and Cambridge as their models, the two devised a plan for the new campus: 15-20 semi-autonomous small colleges where students could have close contact with their professors while still being part of a large research institution.</p>
<p>By the time construction began at Santa Cruz, the Free Speech Movement's Mario Savio had famously called upon the 800 protesters occupying UC Berkeley's Sproul Hall to throw their bodies onto the gears and wheels of the university "machine" and grind it to a halt.</p>
<p>That idea of starting an intimate university free of the heavy bonds of bureaucracy and entrenched thought, along with the beauty of the campus, attracted an impressive list of early faculty who had trained at universities like Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and Cambridge.</p>
<p>"I was teaching at the University of Connecticut," said John Dizikes, a Harvard-educated professor of history who arrived at UC Santa Cruz for its inaugural year. "Several friends said, "For God's sake, don't go there, you'll end up doing the plumbing." Of course they were right, but what they didn't realize was that it was incredibly exciting to start a place where we were relatively free to do new things."</p>
<p>Among Chancellor McHenry's most important hires were two men who would help set the tone for UC's grand and, what some called "eccentric," venture. Byron Stookey Jr., a quiet and gangly Harvard graduate, was named director of academic planning, and a respected, horseback-riding historian named <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/rev-fall-14-road-to-65.html">Page Smith</a> was appointed as Cowell College's first provost.</p>
<p>Together, Stookey and Smith pressed to build a daring intellectual community where learning would become fun and exciting again, where boundaries would be pushed, and what they called "orderly disorder" would rule.</p>
<p>Or as Stookey said: "In order to foster student initiative and individualism, we must institutionalize a tolerance for innovation."</p>
<p>Before classes even began in October 1965, Smith raised the first flag of independence by persuading the new faculty to toss out letter grades in favor of a pass/fail system.</p>
<h3>A scruffy utopia</h3>
<p>UC Santa Cruz's first 652 students were class presidents, high school newspaper editors, award winners, and valedictorians. Students, the majority of them white, arrived in button-down shirts and pleated skirts having finished a heavy list of required readings: James Joyce's <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, Oscar Lewis's <i>The Children of Sanchez</i>, and Friedrich Nietzsche's <i>On the Genealogy of Morals</i>.</p>
<p>But instead of hallowed halls, what they found were piles of lumber, three buildings that still carried the aroma of putty and paint, and wagon-wheel clusters of 40-foot trailers that would serve as dorm rooms. Cost overruns had delayed construction of the first college, Cowell.</p>
<p>Each trailer housed eight, same-gender students&#8212;four at either end with a fake-marble bathroom in the middle. Stuffed with bunk beds, desks, typewriters, clothing, and surfboards, some of the trailers came to look like they were in a perpetual state of ransacking.</p>
<p>Someone dubbed the place, "UC Mobile Home Estates."</p>
<p>"It was like a big summer camp," said Eric Thiermann, who may have been the campus's first entrepreneur, giving $1 haircuts in his trailer&#8212;a skill he'd picked up while working in a Kentucky mental hospital.</p>
<p>Friendships formed quickly in the cramped quarters. Love blossomed despite rules limiting inter-gender trailer visits. Creative students sent beer cans aloft on firecracker boosters.</p>
<p>But the camp-like atmosphere quickly gave way to the intellectual expectations of the campus's originators. Before classes even started, six professors held an energetic Oxford-style debate in front of the student body on whether <i>On the Genealogy of Morals</i> and <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> misled youth.</p>
<p>Bill Dickinson (Cowell '68, philosophy) recalled being inspired by the rigor of those early readings and of that first debate. "I just remember thinking: 'I'm finally on my way to something important in my life,'" he said.</p>
<p>With only a smattering of buildings, the Field House served as a combination lecture hall, dining hall, gymnasium, study hall, and hangout. Professors, many of them only a few years older than their students, ate with their charges and joined them in games of rugby, baseball, and basketball.</p>
<p>Provost Smith also instituted weekly college nights&#8212;completely ignoring a vote of the faculty to hold them only once a month&#8212;where students and professors donned formal attire for a dinner followed by a talk or performance from a heady cast of thinkers and artists.</p>
<p>Among those early college night visitors were beat poet Allen Ginsberg, Harvard theologian Harvey Cox, writer/activist Susan Sontag, Scottish filmmaker Alexander Mackendrick, writer Ana&#239;s Nin, and jazz musician Don Ellis.</p>
<p>Dickinson vividly remembered Smith seating him next to Cox during one of those Thursday night dinners because he knew the young scholar was interested in contemporary theological ideas.</p>
<p>"Growing up as I did, in foster homes and an orphanage," Dickinson said, "I was unaccustomed to receiving that sort of respectful attention."</p>
<p>It was at UC Santa Cruz, Dickinson said, that he learned "my life matters."</p>
<p>"Our thesis is simple," said McHenry in a 1966 speech. "In a college setting where a small number of students and faculty go about their daily business in close proximity, it is just that much more difficult to forget that the students are individual, inexchangeable, irreplaceable human beings."</p>
<p>But perhaps nothing pulled the students and faculty closer than the two-year World Civilization core course required of every student on campus.</p>
<p>William Hitchcock, a Yale-educated historian who served with Naval Intelligence during WWII, was to teach the course, which would end with a single, six-hour exam.</p>
<p>His invigorating 9:30 a.m. lectures not only woke up sleepy students but also forced them to devour a reading list of 32 titles, including portions of the Bible. Professors from other disciplines were called on to lead supporting seminars, so a biologist might find himself heading a discussion on ancient Greece. The flamboyant art professor Mary Holmes gave evening slide-show lectures as part of the course.</p>
<p>During that first year, a date might turn out to be a Holmes lecture on Mesopotamian figurines.</p>
<p>"It was such a rite of passage," said Bonita "Bonnie" Banducci (Stevenson '69, sociology). "The heart of the community and the real foundation of our experience was the World Civilization lectures in the Field House," she said.</p>
<p>The course would prove problematic, however, when a full fifth of the class failed the final exam. After an opportunity to re-take the test, 27 letters of dismissal were sent out and administrators got busy redesigning the course.</p>
<h3>Audacious and academic</h3>
<p>By 1967, Cowell, Stevenson, and Crown colleges had been completed, and the vision of a campus governed by flexibility and experimentation was in full swing. Although at least one student likened the campus to a headless horseman without any kind of obvious direction, most thrived under the system. And, without the burden of grades, students said they felt free to sample new subjects and pursue their passions.</p>
<p>"Because there was so little emphasis on grades, so little emphasis on careers, I think it really opened up people to the possibilities," said Thiermann, whose first taste of photography at UC Santa Cruz would lead him to a career as a filmmaker.</p>
<p>And the campus was rich with possibilities.</p>
<p>Artists like Noah Purifoy, co-founder of the Watts Towers Art Center, and Ruth Asawa, a Japanese-American sculptress and activist, led seminars on campus, while sci-fi author Robert Heinlein showed up, cigarette dangling, to teach a literature class.</p>
<p>With professors also required to teach classes in the colleges, courses like winemaking and American Utopianism were scheduled. Newly hired Earth Sciences Professor Gary Griggs taught a college course titled <i>Shelter,</i> which led students through the process of building a house.</p>
<p>Devoted students flocked to work the soil with Alan Chadwick, a spindly actor-turned-master-gardener who would go on to become a pioneer of organic farming techniques and set the stage for the campus's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.</p>
<p>Newberry, already a popular teacher, sent his introductory biology class on a bird walk from the campus to Natural Bridges State Park. The energetic Smith gave his history students tins of snuff to sample and fired a musket out the classroom door while the lumbering but brilliant psychology professor Bert Kaplan's lecture on "The Psychology of Religious Experience" drew packed houses.</p>
<p>"Instead of being totally focused on getting A's, as I had been," said Betsy Buchalter Adler (Cowell '70, psychology), "I focused on learning."</p>
<p>The academic also mixed with the audacious.</p>
<p>One year, four preceptors covered every inch of an empty room underneath the Cowell dining hall with supermarket posters advertising fruits and vegetables. They dubbed it "The Fruit Room" and invited the entire college to a party there&#8212;a combination art installation and "happening." A series of sculpture based on poses from the Kama Sutra appeared unannounced on the hills of campus. A human chess game saw Art Professor Holmes riding up on a horse dressed as the red queen, while History Professor Jasper Rose once led the entire World Civilization class in a performance of Handel's <i>Messiah</i>.</p>
<p>Culture Festivals at Cowell College featured Greek costumes, a dramatic reading of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's <i>The Grand Inquisitor</i>, and screenings of the movie <i>Oedipus Rex</i>.</p>
<p>"There were rules, but you didn't necessarily know where all of this was going. You had this clear sense that you, yourself, could chart the curriculum and drop in on classes. You got the feeling part of your education was going to rebound to you as your responsibility. You weren't going to be spoon fed," remembered Jock Reynolds (Stevenson '69, psychology).</p>
<p>A talented athlete, Reynolds had planned to be a marine biologist&#8212;until he took a sculpture class from Gurdon Woods, the distinguished former director of the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco who had been lured to Santa Cruz to lead its fledgling art department.</p>
<p>"You have a fine mind, good eyes, and skilled hands," Woods told Reynolds, as the class progressed. He invited Reynolds to work as his weekend studio assistant and also help establish a small bronze foundry in the old blacksmith shop on campus. During Reynolds's senior year, Woods recruited him and a small group of other willing students to take part in a year-long experimental arts workshop led by the avant-garde Fluxus artist Robert Watts. During this creative adventure, Watts introduced his students to a remarkable array of visiting artists including composer John Cage, choreographer Merce Cunningham, and the father of "happenings" Allan Kaprow.</p>
<p>"This year of constant creative experiences was a transformational one, an educational gift of the rarest kind," Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Reynolds would go on to become a notable artist and director of the Yale University Art Gallery, and, by 1968, UC Santa Cruz had more applicants per opening than any other UC campus, including Berkeley and UCLA.</p>
<h3>Times are a changin'</h3>
<p>The Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, and the sexual revolution were reshaping not only the political landscape of the late '60s but also American culture.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy had been assassinated. The anti-war movement was growing. Hair was getting longer and skirts were getting shorter. Some 6.5 million American women were on the pill.</p>
<p>At UC Santa Cruz, students were finding their political power.</p>
<p>In 1968, when UC Regents decided to meet on the UCSC campus, 1,000 students, 20 faculty, two horses, and a pig marched from Cowell to Crown College. They were protesting a Regents' decision to bar Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver from speaking on campuses and to press for the proposed College 7 to focus on African-American studies and be named after activist Malcolm X. At one point, they rushed then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, who retreated with the help of bodyguards, then returned to talk to protesters. During questioning, he reportedly wagged his finger at a student saying, "Now look here, sonny."</p>
<p>Minority students organized a campus-wide class boycott to protest what they saw as an "irrelevant" education system. An attempt to commandeer a meadow and erect a geodesic dome to serve as a gathering center for student activists ended with arrests and a chilly rainstorm.</p>
<p>But students' dissatisfaction was also balanced with an optimism that they could make change happen and, as students moved from dorms into Santa Cruz, their ideals followed, sometimes to the shock of townspeople.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz was the kind of place that attracted brave and visionary people," said <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/05/3786.html">David Talbot</a> (Stevenson '73, sociology), who arrived on campus in 1969. The journalist, who would go on to found Salon.com and write a book about the Kennedy brothers, remembered living in a downtown Victorian with a group of eight feminists from campus.</p>
<p>They started a food co-op and a women's health clinic in Santa Cruz and organized war protests and guerilla theater that landed Talbot in jail on more than one occasion. They gathered UC Santa Cruz students to go into prisons to teach.</p>
<p>"This ferment of creativity that was about imagining a new world was inspired by Santa Cruz," Talbot said.</p>
<p>But change wasn't only about politics.</p>
<p>By the late '60s, plans were already under way for the formation of what would become UC Santa Cruz's Institute of Marine Sciences. J. Herman Blake, the campus's only African American professor, was helping guide the proposed College 7 (now Oakes College) toward an emphasis on ethnic studies. The bearded molecular biologist Harry Noller had also begun his pioneering work on the ribosome, a complex molecular machine found in all cells that translates genetic code into functioning proteins.</p>
<p>"The ivory-tower atmosphere and relative isolation of UCSC were in a way liberating," Noller said in an article about his career. "There were not a lot of 'experts' around to discourage you from going in unusual directions."</p>
<p>For many of those who arrived in 1965, their 1969 graduation would include disgruntled students throwing their diplomas at Kerr and McHenry, and a noisy guerilla theater performance in which activist students conferred an honorary degree on the imprisoned Black Panther leader Huey Newton.</p>
<p>By then, much had changed from the innocence of those trailer days and yet much had stayed the same. With graduation, the bright, young pioneers walked into the world armed not only with their idealism and curiosity, but also with a set of critical thinking skills and the knowledge they had gathered while in the company of friends.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz experiment "worked very beautifully and very surprisingly," said Art Torres (Stevenson '68, government), who would go on to serve eight years as a California assemblyman and 12 years as a state senator, and is now vice-chair on the governing board of the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine.</p>
<p>"It was," he said, "a very magical place."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3a589c048072704638f4f222b3142946"><name>crocodile-genomes</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Scientists reconstruct genome of common ancestor of crocodiles, birds, dinosaurs</title><summary>A new study of crocodilian genomes led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz reveals an exceptionally slow rate of genome evolution.</summary><keywords>Ed Green, crocodilian genomes, Avian Phylogenomics, David Haussler, Genome 10K, G10K</keywords><start-date>1418324400000</start-date><display-name>Scientists reconstruct genome of common ancestor of crocodiles, birds, dinosaurs</display-name><path>/2014/12/crocodile-genomes</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/crocodile-genomes</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1418318093237</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1418325200331</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/figure-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/figure-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figure-425.jpg</name><display-name>figure-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>76165</file-size><width>425</width><height>441</height></image><image-alt>phylogenetic diagram</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/figure-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/figure-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>figure-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>figure-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26331</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>crocodilians</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>This phylogenetic diagram shows the inferred evolutionary relationships among birds, reptiles, and mammals.

A new <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1254449">study</a> of crocodilian genomes led by scientists at UC Santa Cruz reveals an exceptionally slow rate of genome evolution in the crocodilians (a group that includes crocodiles, caimans, alligators, and gharials).</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz team used the crocodilian genomes, combined with newly published bird genomes, to reconstruct a partial genome of the common ancestor of crocodiles, birds, and dinosaurs. The study, part of an ambitious international collaboration to analyze the genomes of modern birds and gain insights into their evolution, is one of eight papers from the Avian Phylogenomics Consortium being published in a December 12 special issue of <i>Science</i>.</p>
<p>Richard E. (Ed) Green, lead author of the crocodilian genome paper and an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz, said the slow evolutionary rate in the crocodilian lineage was helpful in reconstructing the genome of the common ancestor.</p>
<p>"The ticking of the molecular clock in the crocodilians is much slower than in other lineages we're used to looking at, like mammals, which means we can see back into their past more cleanly," Green said.</p>
<p><strong>Archosaurs</strong></p>
<p>The reconstructed genome of the common ancestor will be a valuable tool for investigating the evolution of the "archosaurs," the group that includes all dinosaurs, pterosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. (Crocodilians are actually more closely related to birds and dinosaurs than they are to other reptiles, i.e., lizards, snakes, and turtles.) Green said the genome reconstruction effort, led by UC Santa Cruz research specialist Benedict Paten, yielded about half of the genome sequence of the common ancestor with an accuracy of about 91 percent, and he expects that to improve as more data on bird and crocodile genomes become available.</p>
<p>The team sequenced the genomes of three crocodilian species: the American alligator, the saltwater crocodile, and the Indian gharial. Their analysis indicates that the ancestor of all archosaurs probably had an extremely slow rate of molecular evolution, and that the rate of change sped up in the bird lineage. The rate of molecular evolution of crocodilians is an order of magnitude slower than that of mammals. The most likely reason for this relates to the relatively long time between generations in crocodilians, Green said.</p>
<p>"When it takes longer to get from one generation to the next, you expect the evolutionary rate to be slower, and big animals tend to have long generation times," he said. "We know from fossils that the body plan of crocs has remained largely unchanged for millions of years. Mammals, however, if you go back 50 or 60 million years there were no big mammals, so we see a faster rate of evolutionary change."</p>
<p><strong>Population sizes</strong></p>
<p>The slow rate of genome evolution in crocodilians also enabled the researchers to probe population sizes further into the past than is possible for faster evolving lineages, he said. They found that crocodile and gharial populations experienced sharp declines during the most recent ice age. Alligators, which inhabit more temperate latitudes than other crocodilians, showed a continuous decline in population throughout the Pleistocene epoch.</p>
<p>"Big-bodied, cold-blooded reptiles would have found the Earth a more hospitable place during warm periods like the Pliocene, and the cooling trend of the Pleistocene must have been bad news for crocodilians," Green said.</p>
<p>The new genome sequences are powerful tools for research on the fundamental biology of crocodiles and alligators, he said. Green is particularly interested in understanding the molecular basis of temperature-dependent sex determination in alligators (temperature rather than genetics determines whether a developing alligator becomes male or female). "There are a lot of questions about the evolutionary and molecular biology of crocodilians that we can now start to answer using genomics," he said.</p>
<p>The crocodilian genomes were also useful for the avian phylogenetic analyses, serving as a closely related "out group" for comparison with the bird genomes. Green and several other UC Santa Cruz researchers are coauthors of two articles on avian genomics that accompany the crocodile genomics paper in <i>Science</i>.</p>
<p>After the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the birds that survived experienced a rapid burst of evolution. As a result of this rapid diversification, the family tree of modern birds has confused biologists for centuries. The new genomics studies are helping to sort out those relationships and reveal the molecular details of how birds arrived at their spectacular biodiversity of more than 10,000 living species.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Genome 10K Project</strong></p>
<p>Coauthor David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the <a href="https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/">Genomics Institute</a> at UC Santa Cruz, said the Avian Phylogenomics Project represents a significant step toward the vision of the <a href="http://genome10k.org/">Genome 10K Project</a> (G10K) that he cofounded in 2009 with the goal of sequencing and analyzing the genomes of 10,000 vertebrate species. The G10K consortium helped organize the large international, interdisciplinary collaboration involved in carrying out this massive project.</p>
<p>Haussler and the other G10K leaders--Stephen O'Brien of St. Petersburg State University (Russia) and Oliver Ryder of the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research--published a commentary on the Avian Phylogenomics Project in the journal <i>GigaScience</i>, noting that the project has yielded "the most extensive comparative genomics analysis produced for any vertebrate group so far." In addition to the eight papers in <i>Science</i>, the project's initial findings are being reported in 15 other papers in <i>Genome Biology, GigaScience,</i> and other journals.</p>
<p>"G10K's contributions include a lot of work convincing people to work together, setting up collaborations, and holding meetings to get people to share ideas and get to know each other. In the end, of course, credit for this most recent work goes to the scientists most closely involved in the actual sequencing and analysis," Haussler said.</p>
<p>The Avian Phylogenomics Consortium is led by Guojie Zhang of the National Genebank at BGI in China and the University of Copenhagen, Erich D. Jarvis of Duke University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and M. Thomas P. Gilbert of the Natural History Museum of Denmark. Contributors to the crocodilian genomics paper include 54 scientists at dozens of institutions. The crocodilian research was supported by the National Science Foundation, and Green has funding from a Searle Scholarship and a Sloan Fellowship.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215.cover-expansion</url><title>Science special issue: Avian Genomes</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://genomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://genome10k.soe.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Genome 10K Project</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3a9615d98072704638f4f222e4857e5d"><name>fischer-aps</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Peter Fischer elected fellow of American Physical Society</title><summary>Peter Fischer, adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society.</summary><keywords>Peter Fischer, APS Fellow</keywords><start-date>1418284800000</start-date><display-name>Physicist Peter Fischer elected fellow of American Physical Society</display-name><path>/2014/12/fischer-aps</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/fischer-aps</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1418322122106</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1418322213770</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/peter-fischer.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/peter-fischer.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-fischer.jpg</name><display-name>peter-fischer.jpg</display-name><file-size>45293</file-size><width>210</width><height>288</height></image><image-alt>Peter Fischer</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/peter-fischer-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/peter-fischer-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>peter-fischer-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>peter-fischer-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22082</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Peter Fischer</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Peter Fischer</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Peter Fischer, adjunct professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS). Election as an APS Fellow is a major recognition of professional accomplishment from the leading organization of physicists.</p>
<p>Fischer's expertise is in characterizing magnetic materials with polarized x-rays. He is also strongly engaged in developing the instrumentation needed for this work, including x-ray optics for x-ray microscopy. His research interests include magnetism on the nano- and mesoscale, magnetic x-ray microscopy and spectroscopy, ultra-fast spin dynamics, and soft x-ray tomography of condensed matter. A staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Fischer joined the UCSC faculty as an adjunct professor in 2014.</p>

<p>The team led by UC Santa Cruz astronomers Sebastiano Cantalupo (now at ETH Zurich), J. Xavier Prochaska, and Piero Madau detected the glowing gas of the filament due to its illumination by the intense radiation given off by a distant quasar. Using the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, they observed a very large, luminous nebula of gas extending about 2 million light-years across intergalactic space, which they nicknamed the 'Slug Nebula' in honor of UCSC's banana slug mascot.</p>
<p>This is the second time that Prochaska's research group has been recognized by <i>Physics World</i> for a top ten breakthrough. In 2011, his team's discovery of pristine clouds of gas formed shortly after the Big Bang was also featured as one of nine runners-up to the "Breakthrough of the Year" in <i>Science</i> magazine in addition to making the <i>Physics World</i> top ten (see <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/12/physics-world-top10.html">UCSC news story</a>).</p>
<p>"It may never happen again, so I'm especially amazed to get this acknowledgement a second time," said Prochaska, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.</p>
<p>Prochaska noted that a new instrument is being built for Keck Observatory that will greatly facilitate future research on the cosmic web. The Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) will be able to perform "spectral imaging," capturing both an image and a spectrum of an object simultaneously. The UC Observatories instrument labs at UC Santa Cruz are currently working on the camera for KCWI.</p>
<p><i><a href="http://physicsworld.com">Physics World</a></i> is an international monthly magazine published by the Institute of Physics. In addition to Cantalupo, Prochaska, and Madau, the coauthors of the cosmic web paper included Fabrizio Arrigoni-Battaia and Joseph Hennawi of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg.

This storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall, high winds, and isolated thunderstorms and hail. The potential for wind with gusts of 35 to 40 mph (up to 60 mph at higher elevations) is likely to result in downed trees throughout the region, which may cause both road or transit delays and power outages. There is a potential for flooding of low-lying areas, as well as small creeks and streams. Flooding of large rivers is not expected. <br/> <br/> The UC Santa Cruz Office of Emergency Services (OES) is monitoring the situation in conjunction with other campus and local emergency personnel. Though not expected, if any significant campus operational impacts occur, they will be posted on the campus home page and communicated to the campus community. <br/> <br/> As the first significant storm of the winter, this is a good opportunity to review storm preparedness information and resources. During any storm event, it is important to take steps for your own safety.<br/>
<ul>
<li>Use caution when outdoors during high wind and thunderstorm activity. Be aware of overhead hazards such as tree limbs and power lines.</li>
<li>Never approach a downed wire, even if it is not actively arcing or sparking. Report all downed wires to 911.</li>
<li>Allow extra time during commute periods to account for wet roadways, heavy traffic, and accidents. Drive cautiously and leave extra space when following to allow for increased braking distances in wet conditions. Remember that California state law requires headlights to be on during all periods of rain.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to drive or walk through flooded areas.</li>
<li>Bicyclists and motorcyclists should use lights and wear retroreflective rain gear or vests to ensure that they are visible.</li>
<li>Take steps to prepare your home. Ensure that your gutters are clear and that any loose exterior furniture or other items which may become airborne during heavy wind are properly secured.</li>
<li>If you have low-lying areas that are subject to flooding, take steps to mitigate these issues such as using sandbags.</li>
<li>Have flashlights and lanterns available in the event of a power outage, and be sure that they have fresh batteries.</li>
<li>Never use charcoal or propane fueled devices such as grills, heaters, or lanterns inside. These present both a fire hazard as well as a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>

<p>This year, Acting Dean Martin Berger has appointed professor Leta Miller of the Music Department and Carolyn Dean in the History of Art and Visual Culture Department as 2014 <em>Arts Dean&#8217;s Eminent Professors</em>.</p>
<p>The title is the division&#8217;s highest recognition of faculty research achievement. &#160;</p>
<p>Recommended by a panel of distinguished senior and emeriti faculty, the Dean&#8217;s Eminent Professors are appointed to five-year renewable terms and receive $10,000 in research funds.</p>
<p>Miller is a musicologist with broad expertise, whose recent work has focused on 20th-century U.S. avant-garde composers.</p>
<p>Best known for her research on Lou Harrison, John Cage, Henry Cowell, and Charles Ives, she has also published on the 16th-century madrigal, as well as on the links between music and science in 17th and 18th-century Europe.</p>
<p>The author or editor of nearly a dozen books, Miller is also an accomplished musician who has recorded performances of renaissance, baroque, and modern flute.</p>
<p>She has been awarded five recording grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Copland Fund, and three research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities.&#160;</p>
<p>Miller joined the UC Santa Cruz faculty in 1987. Her latest book is the first full-length biography of the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Aaron Jay Kernis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Committee members were taken with her deep archival work, remarkable range, beautiful writing, and consistent productivity,&#8221; Berger noted.</p>
<p>Carolyn Dean is one of the leading scholars of Pre-Hispanic and Spanish Colonial art and visual culture. Her work is multidisciplinary, drawing on art history, visual studies, archaeology, anthropology, history, and paleography. &#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;In her two books and numerous articles, she&#8217;s consistently concerned herself with illuminating the unseen cultural frames that give meaning to ceremonial objects, buildings, rocks, and even water,&#8221; said Berger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fighting against the collective weight of centuries of European and European-American interpretations that make use of Western paradigms for understanding indigenous cultures, she painstakingly resurrects the original contexts in which objects were made and viewed,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Dean has won prestigious fellowships from some of the leading arts and humanities granting agencies in the country, among them, the American Council of Learned Societies, Pew Charitable Trust, J. Paul Getty Trust, and the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts.</p>
<p>Her book, <em>A Culture of Stone: Inka Perspectives on Rock</em>, received the 2011 Arvey Prize from the Association for Latin American Art, presented annually for the best scholarly book published on the art of Latin America from the Pre-Columbian era to the present.</p>
<p>Dean joined the arts faculty in 1991. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4f120bd88072704638f4f22271787a8b"><name>hackathon</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz hosts an expanded Santa Cruz hackathon January 9 to 11 </title><summary>HACK UCSC 2015 is open to students throughout the Monterey Bay region</summary><keywords>HACK UCSC, hackathon, Brent Haddad, Doug Erickson</keywords><start-date>1418630400000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz hosts an expanded Santa Cruz hackathon January 9 to 11 </display-name><path>/2014/12/hackathon</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/hackathon</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1418665790326</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1421445103929</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/doug-brent-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/doug-brent-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>doug-brent-400.jpg</name><display-name>doug-brent-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>83160</file-size><width>400</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt>Doug Erickson and Brent Haddad</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/hack-2014-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/hack-2014-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hack-2014-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hack-2014-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26705</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>students at hackathon</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>UCSC alumnus and Santa Cruz New Tech MeetUp founder Doug Erickson (left) and Brent Haddad of the UCSC Center for Entrepreneurship (right) at HACK UCSC 2014.</p></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/12/images/hack-2014-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/12/images/hack-2014-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hack-2014-400.jpg</name><display-name>hack-2014-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>85445</file-size><width>400</width><height>257</height></image><image-alt>student teams at hackathon</image-alt><image-caption>The first UC Santa Cruz hackathon was held at the Oakes Learning Center in April.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>HACK UCSC 2015 is open to students throughout the Monterey Bay region; speakers include Lila Tretikov, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation</article-subhead><article-text><p>The second UC Santa Cruz hackathon will take place January 9 to 11 at the Crown Merrill Cultural Center, bringing together programmers, designers, and tech enthusiasts from throughout the Monterey Bay region. Ten finalist teams will present to the larger community at an invitation-only awards dinner on Sunday, January 11, at which judges will award more than $80,000 in cash and prizes.</p>
<p>A hackathon is a coding marathon in which teams comprised of developers, designers, and entrepreneurs work together to create apps and programs. The themes for the <a href="http://hackucsc.com/">HACK UCSC 2015</a> event are technology, environmental stewardship, and social justice.</p>
<p>Speakers at the event will include Lila Tretikov, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation; Scott Brandt, vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Cruz; and Bud Colligan, founder and CEO of South Swell Ventures. Award categories are Innovation, AgTech, and Tech Cares. The Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County is sponsoring the Tech Cares award, with a $4,000 gift to be awarded for projects that focus on benefiting non-profit organizations and causes.</p>
<p>Brent Haddad, director of the <a href="https://c4e.ucsc.edu/">Center for Entrepreneurship</a> at UC Santa Cruz and one of the organizers of the event, said it is a great opportunity for students to hone their skills and connect with leaders of the local tech industry. In honor of the <a href="http://50years.ucsc.edu/">50th anniversary</a> of UC Santa Cruz in 2015, special prizes will be awarded to projects that focus on genomics, coastal sustainability, social justice, gaming, data science, and linking arts and sciences.</p>
<p>"Our campus is 50 years young and providing ideas and energy to the regional economy," Haddad said.</p>
<p>Following the success of the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/04/hackathon-winners.html">inaugural UCSC hackathon</a> in April 2014, HACK UCSC 2015 has set its sights even higher this year. The event has been expanded to include non-students as well as students from schools around the Monterey Bay crescent, including UC Santa Cruz, Cal State Monterey Bay (CSUMB), Cabrillo College, and local high schools.</p>
<p>"We were very pleased with the inaugural event last year," said co-organizer Doug Erickson, a UCSC alumnus and founder of the Santa Cruz New Tech MeetUp. "When we surveyed the participants 2 weeks after the hackathon, we learned that over 50 percent had been made job offers."</p>
<p>Co-organizer Mark Adams, program manager at Santa Cruz Works, was a senior in business management economics at UCSC and student coordinator at the Center for Entrepreneurship when he helped organize the April Hackathon. "It's events like the hackathon that contribute to a vibrant tech scene," Adams said. "Students discover that there is a local ecosystem that will support their efforts long past the hackathon."</p>

<p>The idea of learning outcomes assessment is grounded in a combination of quality assurance and self-improvement. Outcomes assessment is a national phenomenon, and UC campuses have taken an approach that is discipline-specific and faculty-owned. This approach is more appropriate for a research university, in contrast to the external benchmarks or standardized tests that are used in some other educational settings. The UC campuses communicate regularly on ideas and best practices, but each campus has its own implementation.</p>
<p>At a research university, faculty approach research by forming a research question, collecting evidence, and evaluating the findings. Learning outcomes assessment takes that same framework and applies it to teaching. Faculty start by defining the outcomes, which are the knowledge and skills that they expect their graduates to have obtained in each major. They then look at key assignments to collect evidence and evaluate that learning. This allows faculty to engage in evidence-based discussions that can result in innovative changes for improving student learning.</p>
<p>Making program learning outcomes publicly available can be helpful for students. As students choose a major, they can see how their future degree can equip them with skills valuable on the job market and in their community. Outcomes provide a high-level roadmap for each major that is useful for all students&#8212;and can be particularly helpful for first-generation and transfer students.</p>
<p>The campus goal is to build assessment into the teaching culture, ideally as collaborations of multiple faculty across several courses. Faculty already do course-level assessment in the grading of assignments, papers, projects, and exams. Program-level assessment provides a more holistic view of student learning.</p>
<p>Assessment is most useful as an ongoing process. Thus each program is asked to create an annual report each year, and these are made available to the Academic Senate Committee on Educational Policy, Graduate Council, and the deans. This work also helps us prepare for our accreditation review in 2015.</p>
<p>Outcomes assessment can be done alongside grading of existing assignments, so that it does not take much additional effort. Undergraduate program assessment is done in only a few senior-level courses each year and may involve a moderately sized sample of students in a large major. Graduate program assessment may look at PhD defenses and masters capstones. Faculty can use rubrics to streamline the effort, improve consistency across evaluators, and collect information to guide improvements.</p>
<p>The campus has been building support of faculty assessment efforts. Guidelines and resources are available <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/irps/assessment/">online</a>. The campus assessment expert, Anna Sher, is available to help faculty with all aspects of the process.</p>
<p>Program learning outcomes are being posted on each program website, and the campus has compiled <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/irps/assessment/PLOs.asp">links to most programs</a>. Undergraduate outcomes are being added to the catalog to make it easier for students to find them.</p>
<p>I appreciate the effort our faculty have and continue to put in to make assessment successful and useful, to the benefit of our students.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

href="http://www.abrcms.org/index.php/abrcms">Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students</a> in San Antonio in November. All of the students were participants in programs administered by the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">STEM Diversity Office</a>.</p>
<p>Two of the awards went to scholars in a new Postbaccalaureate Research Experience Program (PREP) funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The UCSC PREP program supports students from underrepresented groups who have recently earned their undergraduate degrees, providing them with intensive research experience and preparing them to earn Ph.D. degrees in the biomedical sciences.</p>
<p>The PREP winners were <b>Jasenia Hartman</b> and <b>Gustavo Chata</b>. Hartman, who works with Professor Donald Smith in the Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology, won in the conference's Chemistry Division sponsored by the American Chemical Society. Her presentation was on "Alteration of Glutamatergic Proteins in the Prefrontal Cortex and Striatum Following Early Life Manganese Exposure: Potential Neurotoxic Targets." Chata, who works in the lab of Professor Pradip Mascharak in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, won in the Engineering, Physics and Math Division sponsored by the Biophysical Society. His presentation was on &#8220;Synthesis and Characterization of a Wound Dressing that Allows Tracking of Silver as the Antibacterial Agent."</p>
<p>Two poster presentation awards went to students in the Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) program. Also funded by the NIH, the MARC Program has been providing support to junior and senior honors students in the biomedical disciplines at UC Santa Cruz for over three decades.</p>
<p>The winners from the MARC program were <b>Adan Codina</b> and <b>Shannon Barbour</b>. Codina, who works with Professor William Sullivan's research group in the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental (MCD) Biology, won in the Biochemistry Division sponsored by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology for his poster presentation on "Mitochondrial Protective Peptide SS-31 Reverses Cardiac Aging in Mice." Barbour, who works with Professor Ted Holman in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, won in the Developmental Biology and Genetic Division sponsored by the Society for Developmental Biology and Genetics Society of America for her poster on "An Evolutionary Arms Race between Endogenous Retroelements and their Restriction Factors."</p>
<p>Another poster award went to <b>Cecilia Im</b>, a junior in the UC LEADS (Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees) program, who works with Professor Barry Bowman in MCD Biology. Im won for her poster presentation on "UFO: The Search for an Unidentified Fungal Organelle Using a Novel Technique for Homologous Integration." The UC LEADS program prepares promising students for advanced education in science, technology, mathematics and engineering (STEM). The program, which is run out of the STEM Diversity Office and funded by the UC Office of the President, is designed to identify upper-division undergraduate students with the potential to succeed in STEM disciplines, but who have experienced situations or conditions that have adversely impacted their advancement in their field of study.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="508f98678072704638f4f222587127eb"><name>news-article</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>This is an article</title><start-date>1418630400000</start-date><path>/2014/12/news-article</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2014/12/news-article</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1418690795555</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1418690795555</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>This is a <a href="hernandez-jason.xml">link</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="544cf0cf8072704638f4f2227fb3fc1e"><name>photo-contest-winners</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2014 Photo Contest winners</title><summary>We received more than 200 entries to this year's Chancellor's Holiday Photo Contest.

In an email to his colleagues Wednesday after learning of Maechler&#8217;s appointment, Fung said, &#8220;I think this is a wonderful thing for our department and for our university. I am happy for her and I am proud of her.&#8221;<br/><br/>Fung and Maechler published several papers together including one in 2000, &#8220;Can a Cleaner Environment Be Good for Business?," which followed her dissertation on environmental international trade. <br/><br/>In a statement Wednesday (December 17), the Swiss government said Maechler was chosen because of her proven skills. &#8216;&#8221;In more than 16 years of professional activity, she has acquired sound knowledge in the field of international monetary affairs and of financial stability.&#8221; <br/><br/>Maechler is currently deputy division chief in the Global Markets Analysis Department at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. She has previously worked for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the UN Conference on Trade and Development, the World Trade Organization and the European Systemic Risk Board. <br/><br/>At the SNB, Maechler will head the department responsible for the bank&#8217;s cap on the Swiss franc versus the euro. She will also be in charge of managing the SNB's foreign currency reserves of approximately 460 billion Swiss francs ($474.81 billion).<br/><br/>Maechler joins a small group of women in top jobs in central banking, including Janet Yellen at the U.S. Federal Reserve,&#160; Sabine Lautenschlaeger at the European Central Bank, and Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF.&#160; <br/><br/>Before attending UC Santa Cruz, Maechler completed undergraduate work at the University of Toronto, and also studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva and the Institute of Advanced Studies in Public Administration in Lausanne.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/pre_20141217/source/pre_20141217.en.pdf</url><title>Swiss government announcement </title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="64a7ab2d8072704638f4f2227201987d"><name>attempted-kidnapping-assault</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Community crime bulletin: Attempted kidnapping, assault with injury, false imprisonment with violence</title><summary>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is seeking the public's help with its investigation into a reported attempted kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon, and false imprisonment with violence at 7 p.m. Dec. 18 in the North Remote Parking Lot.&#13;
