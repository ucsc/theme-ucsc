<p>Following the tragic Dec. 12 shuttle crash, UC Santa Cruz asked the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to inspect its 35-foot shuttles. Due to available resources, the CHP was able to inspect nine of the 12 shuttles. The CHP shared a preliminary report on Jan. 19 and provided UC Santa Cruz with five business days to review the report and ask questions about the findings.</p>
<p>These inspection results are separate from the ongoing investigation of the crash, and the shuttle involved was not part of this review. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is actively investigating the crash, and we will share more information when it concludes.</p>
<p>With a commitment to openness and to ensure our campus has confidence in our transit services, UC Santa Cruz is sharing a summary of the findings, how we are addressing the findings, and the steps we will take over the coming months to ensure a more effective vehicle maintenance program. The full report is also <a href="images/ucsc-chp-terminal-inspection-1-2024_redacted.pdf">available as a PDF</a>, with personal identifying employee information redacted.</p>
<p>Four of our 35-foot shuttles were cleared for service by the CHP immediately following their inspection with another being roadworthy with some minor adjustments. We provided service at the start of winter quarter using these cleared shuttles and our smaller cutaway shuttles. The CHP placed five of the nine 35-foot shuttles out of service after identifying that emergency window exits required repairs to ensure they&#8217;re functioning as designed and where brake systems required adjustments.</p>
<p>While none of the issues included in this report were identified in our previous annual CHP inspections, <a href="images/2023-09-chp-report-redacted.pdf">including the one conducted in September 2023</a>, the safety of everyone in our campus community is our highest priority and we are expeditiously addressing the report&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>Below are the three primary areas identified for improvement in the CHP report and our plans to address them:</p>
<p><strong>Conducting comprehensive shuttle inspections every six months or 6,000 miles</strong></p>
<p>The CHP&#8217;s review of maintenance records showed that the campus has not been systematically inspecting shuttles at set intervals, either every six months or every 6,000 miles. In two instances, inspections were past due for a shuttle by 928 miles and for another by 335 days.</p>
<p>While these mixed intervals involved shuttles that were not in operation because they were in need of parts and/or repair, going forward, we will develop an enhanced process with additional internal reviews to be fully and consistently meeting or exceeding requirements. We will address any repairs and adjustments that are revealed before placing buses back in service.</p>
<p><strong>Inspecting emergency exits at least every 90 days</strong></p>
<p>The CHP&#8217;s review of maintenance records showed that the campus was not inspecting the emergency window exits every 90 days. The campus had been inspecting emergency window exits every 180 days. In one instance, an inspection for one shuttle was past due by 426 days.</p>
<p>We are developing an enhanced process with additional internal reviews to consistently conduct these inspections every 90 days and immediately address any issues that we discover. For both of these inspection requirements, we will confirm our compliance and share results on the TAPS website.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring all drivers meet state licensing requirements</strong></p>
<p>The CHP&#8217;s review stated that one of the campus bus drivers was continuing to work without an up-to-date medical certificate on record with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. While this appears to be an error with the DMV&#8217;s database, as the driver did in fact consistently possess a valid medical certificate, we will be changing our procedures to make sure all drivers are maintaining required drivers licenses and medical certifications with the DMV, and that the DMV database and our records match. Additionally, we have completed a review of all shuttle drivers to ensure proper documentation is in place. All current drivers maintain both the appropriate licenses and medical certificates.</p>
<p>Because more than 50 percent of the shuttles inspected were placed out of service, the CHP assigned UC Santa Cruz an unsatisfactory rating and, as required by California Vehicle Code, designated the transit operation as meeting the classification of imminent danger to public safety.</p>

<h1><a id="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>UC Santa Cruz Transportation and Parking Services operates a Campus Transit program to help students, faculty, and staff get around campus. The shuttles run two primary routes: a campus loop that goes from the base of campus at Bay and High streets through the academic core and back to the base, and an upper campus route that goes between the East Remote Parking Lot and the West Remote Parking Lot with stops along Heller Road, McLaughlin Drive, and Hagar Drive.</p>
<p>The shuttle drivers and fleet maintenance staff are trained professionals that share a commitment to high safety standards. They work closely together and are represented by AFSCME 3299.</p>
<h2>How many shuttles does UC Santa Cruz have and how old are they?</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has approximately 30 shuttles in our Campus Transit fleet. Model years range from 1993 to 2014. In 2006, the shuttles manufactured in 1993 received new engines, transmissions, and modernized exhaust filter systems to minimize particulate emissions.</p>
<h2>How are the buses maintained and how often are they inspected?</h2>
<p>All university vehicle maintenance, including that performed on Campus Transit Shuttles, is initiated and completed by UC Santa Cruz Fleet Services; Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) does not maintain shuttles.</p>
<p>Campus shuttles go through several types of regular inspection: before they are put into operation and annually by the California Highway Patrol.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-trip inspections</strong></p>
<p>Before any shuttle is put into operation, TAPS operators conduct standardized pre-trip inspections. Items that are inspected include, but are not limited to, gauges and warning lights, headlights, tail lights, signals, brakes, tires and wheels, doors and emergency equipment.</p>
<p>Any issues are reported to Fleet Services for immediate diagnoses and action. Vehicles that are deemed not roadworthy are secured, locked out, and only released back to TAPS when they are verified as safe to carry passengers.</p>
<p><strong>Regular inspections</strong></p>
<p>Multi-point safety inspections and routine maintenance are conducted by our technicians represented by AFSCME 3299 &#8211; this is the union that represents both TAPS' Campus Transit drivers and Fleet Services' Heavy Equipment Technicians &#8211; at regular intervals. Our inspection and preventive maintenance schedules are reviewed and approved by the California Highway Patrol. Any issues identified during safety inspections are immediately addressed or, for those issues where parts are not in hand, scheduled for follow-up services.</p>
<p><strong>Annual inspections by the California Highway Patrol</strong></p>
<p>The California Highway Patrol conducts an annual inspection of our heavy-duty maintenance program. Their inspectors review our work orders and visually inspect our equipment.</p>
<p>For more than two decades, UCSC&#8217;s maintenance program has received &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; ratings&#8211;the highest available. Our last inspection was in September 2023; no deficiencies were found with any of the shuttles examined by the CHP, including the one in the December 2023 crash.</p>
<p>During winter break, UC Santa Cruz requested the CHP conduct an off-cycle safety inspection of all 12 of campus&#8217;s available 35-foot shuttles. The CHP safety inspection began in January 2024. The CHP&#8217;s final report has revealed some important areas for improvement and resulted in an unsatisfactory rating. The inspection showed that the campus has not been systematically inspecting shuttles at set intervals; that the campus was not inspecting the emergency window exits every 90 days; and that the campus needs to ensure that DMV records are consistent with campus records.</p>
<p>While none of the issues included in this report were identified in our previous annual CHP inspections, the safety of everyone in our campus community is our highest priority and we are expeditiously addressing the report&#8217;s findings.</p>
<h2>What inspections were conducted on the shuttle involved in the crash?</h2>
<p>The shuttle involved in the crash was inspected and cleared by the California Highway Patrol in September 2023 as part of CHPs annual review and no issues were identified. This shuttle also had a regular multi-point safety inspection and maintenance one week prior to the crash. Critical safety points were checked and adjusted such as the tires, brakes, steering, and suspension. These inspections conform to the CHP&#8217;s recommendations. Shuttles under inspection are also road tested by a professional mechanic both before and after the inspection.</p>
<p>The shuttle was deemed to be within safe operating parameters by Fleet Service personnel.</p>
<h2>Are campus shuttles older than the federal government recommends?</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/docs/Useful_Life_of_Buses_Final_Report_4-26-07_rv1.pdf">federal government determines a &#8220;minimum life&#8221;</a> for vehicles purchased with federal dollars, it does not dictate the retirement age or useful life of a transit vehicle. The longevity of a transit vehicle depends on a number of factors, such as whether the vehicle was in heavy, medium or light usage and whether it was &#8220;repowered&#8221; by receiving a new engine and transmission and extending its roadworthy condition.</p>
<p>This &#8220;minimum life&#8221; determination is mostly intended to apply to buses that are in heavy usage&#8211;such as those that carry passengers across the country or for transit operations that serve major metropolitan areas. UC Santa Cruz shuttles run for about 6.5 hours each day for 5 days a week through campus.</p>
<h2>Is it common for transit agencies to use older buses?</h2>
<p>There is a large secondary market for buses, including some that are of the same age as the shuttles in our fleet. Nearly all of the UCSC shuttles were first operated by a local transit agency and sold to us through a company that re-markets buses as its primary mission.</p>
<h2>When will the campus get new shuttles?</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz is in the process of procuring two fully electric shuttles from Gillig and developing a plan to fully electrify its fleet.</p>
<p>Electric buses are in high demand and the two 35-foot Gillig Battery Electric Buses are expected to enter the production line in September 2025 and be delivered to campus in mid-to-late October 2025.</p>
<p>The campus will soon be deploying four newer diesel buses, and is exploring other options for accelerating the retirement of its older shuttles.</p>
<h2>Did one of the shuttles catch on fire last year?</h2>
<p>Yes, a shuttle bus that was in operation caught fire on Nov. 13, 2023. Students and the driver evacuated the shuttle and the fire was quickly extinguished by responding units from the Santa Cruz Fire Department. No one was injured in this incident.</p>
<p>An investigation pointed to a failed sensor in the diesel after-treatment system, which was installed in the bus along with a new engine and transmission in 2006. These systems are maintained annually and inspected semi-annually, per industry standard. Our maintenance team concluded the sensor failure to be an isolated event, but out of an abundance of caution, campus bus technicians reinspected all similar diesel after-treatment systems in the fleet. No deficiencies were found.</p>
<h2>Will Metro be taking over the loop shuttle service?</h2>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has no plans to have Metro take over its loop bus service, or any other element of Campus Transit services.</p>
<p>For the past several months, campus leaders have been in discussions with Metro about possible service improvements on campus routes, and look forward to continuing those discussions with them.</p>

<p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is continuing to investigate the cause of the <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/12/campus-bus-driver.html">tragic Dec. 12 shuttle crash</a>. We appreciate the community&#8217;s patience and understanding while we seek to learn what happened. Because the police investigation is currently on-going we do not have information to share. We will provide more information when it concludes.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2024/transit-update.html">we shared last month</a>, in an abundance of caution we voluntarily took all our 35-foot shuttles out of service after the crash and asked the California Highway Patrol (CHP) to conduct an independent inspection of those shuttles. As a reminder, these inspections are separate from the ongoing investigation of the Dec. 12 crash, and the shuttle involved was not part of this review.</p>
<p>The inspections required us to use smaller shuttles and reduce our service levels during the start of winter quarter, causing longer waits during peak times. We appreciate everyone&#8217;s patience and understanding. Providing safe transportation is our highest priority and we are committed to taking all necessary and appropriate measures in support of safety.</p>
<p>As of this week, we have up to 12 shuttles running at peak times each day, the same level of service as in the fall. This includes eight 35-foot shuttles. All shuttles currently in service have been independently inspected and meet all state and federal laws and regulations.</p>
<p>We recently received the final results of CHP&#8217;s inspection of the 35-foot shuttles. While UC Santa Cruz has received satisfactory ratings from the CHP for more than two decades, this report has revealed some important areas for improvement and resulted in an unsatisfactory rating. The inspection showed that the campus has not been systematically inspecting shuttles at certain set intervals; that the campus was not inspecting the emergency window exits every 90 days; and that the campus needs to ensure that DMV records are consistent with campus records.</p>
<p>None of the issues included in this report were identified in our previous annual CHP inspections, including our most recent previous inspection in September 2023. We take these issues seriously and the safety of everyone in our campus community is our highest priority as we expeditiously address the report&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>You can find the final report and <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2024/02/inspection-report.html">our work to address the findings online</a>, along with a set of <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2024/02/inspection-report.html#faq">frequently asked questions</a> about our transit operation. In addition to addressing the areas the CHP identified as needing improvement, we have also asked the CHP to conduct specialized training for our staff to promote safe transit operations.</p>
<p>To further promote having a high-quality vehicle maintenance program that follows industry standards and best practices, I am also bringing in an independent third-party expert to conduct a comprehensive review of our maintenance program. We will be ready to quickly make changes and improvements as appropriate.</p>
<p>We have made the adjustments and repairs recommended by the CHP report to all of our 35-foot shuttles, and a certified, independent expert inspected them to confirm they are ready to return to service. Starting in early January, that expert began inspecting the rest of our shuttles, and that process will continue through this month. Like with the 35-foot shuttles, none will return to service until they are cleared.</p>
<p>The CHP is planning to reinspect our shuttles and maintenance program in May and we are committed to again earning a satisfactory rating, the highest possible designation.</p>
<p>The safety of our campus community is our utmost priority and we want every rider to be confident that our drivers and shuttles are meeting or exceeding expectations in the delivery of transit services.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>Ed</p>

All campus community members are invited to provide feedback directly through </span><a href="https://forms.gle/PXQcsZaxMTHCLpM6A"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this Google Form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Established by Chancellor Larive in 2022, the University Space Committee serves as a forum providing advice and recommendations regarding campus space planning, allocations, assignment and reassignment. All campus spaces, including the residential campus, Westside Research Park, Coastal Science Campus, Scotts Valley Center, Silicon Valley Campus, and MBEST Center are the property of the Board of Regents and are managed by the chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chancellor has the overall responsibility for the equitable and optimum use of space resources and final decision authority for the planning, allocation, assignment, and reassignment of all spaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In its advisory role to the chancellor, the University Space Committee plays a vital role in ensuring all space standards and management activities are transparent and disclosed to the campus community, and that the allocations serve the mission and goals of the university,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor (CP/EVC) Lori Kletzer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CP/EVC and Vice Chancellor for Finance, Operations and Administration Ed Reiskin are co-chairs of the space committee. Members include faculty and staff with expertise in varying areas of space and a student representative. Most serve one- or two-year terms, which run an academic year. More information on the makeup of the University Space Committee is available on the committee&#8217;s </span><a href="https://chancellor.ucsc.edu/committees/university-space-committee.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br/><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advice and recommendations from the committee include:&#160;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review unit space requests&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-evaluate space usage</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-assignment of space&#160;<br/><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simplified process to request or release space is available on the </span><a href="https://cpsm.ucsc.edu/space-management/space-requests.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital Planning and Space Management website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Space Committee reviews requests and other related information and makes a recommendation to the chancellor, who makes the final decision on the allocation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University Space Management Policy review period will conclude on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> March 8, 2024.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The final, updated policy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be shared on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 11, 2024 on the </span><a href="https://policy.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administrative Policy website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

This spring&#8217;s ceremonies will be held on the East Upper Field from June 14&#8211;17, 2024. Given our infrastructure constraints, we must extend the timing of commencement by one day. The commencement ceremonies will be in their traditional style and organized by college.</span></p>
<p><span>We have received significant feedback from our community and while our previous Slug Crossing format allowed for more guests for graduates, a front-row view for guests as graduates crossed the stage and could be sustainably supported on our campus, there were still many who preferred a traditional commencement format. The decision to return to a more traditional series of ceremonies for 2024 was informed by the feedback that I have received from campus stakeholders and a recommendation by University Advancement (UA) after they engaged in an event review with an outside event advising and production company. I am grateful for the hard work of everyone who has contributed to commencement during the transitions we have faced and as we work together toward a sustainable plan for the future.</span></p>
<p><span>UA ultimately found that in the future, an off-campus venue will be the only way to accommodate the growing number of graduates and guests attending this important milestone. Facing similar pressures, UC Davis and UC Riverside last year made the decision to hold their commencement ceremonies off campus.</span></p>
<p><span>More information about the schedule of events for 2024 within the commencement dates, number of tickets per graduate and instructions for seniors will follow soon. I&#8217;m looking forward to celebrating the class of 2024 and all that they have accomplished.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Cindy Larive</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7bb75cdb807270467760583418cea7ef"><name>election-day-march-2024</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>March 5 is Election Day in California</title><start-date>1707206400000</start-date><display-name>March 5 is Election Day in California</display-name><path>/2024/02/election-day-march-2024</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/election-day-march-2024</link><created-by>sgmessic</created-by><created-on>1707177630918</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1707259306736</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/sammy_ballot.png</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/sammy_ballot.png</link><site>news</site><name>sammy_ballot.png</name><display-name>sammy_ballot.png</display-name><file-size>175964</file-size><width>288</width><height>512</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>March 5 is Election Day in California.

<p><strong>How can I vote?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting is a citizen's fundamental right, and UC Santa Cruz urges you to let your voice be heard. This year, the campus is making it as easy as possible for you to cast your ballot.</span></p>

If you have a mail ballot and are registered in Santa Cruz County, you can mail it before March 5th or hand it in at any polling place on Election Day.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Prohibition of Electioneering and Corruption of the Voting Process</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All activities of electioneering and corruption of the voting process are strictly prohibited. Please review the California Secretary of State webpage for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/administration/regulations/current-regulations/elections/notices-regarding-prohibition-electioneering-and-corruption-voting-process">Notices on Electioneering and Corruption of the Voting Process</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Voter Registration</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://registertovote.ca.gov/?t=s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can register to vote online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or you can register to vote in-person through the Santa Cruz County Elections department who will be coming to campus at the Bay Tree Campus Store parking Lot 102 with their VoteMobile trailer on the following dates and times:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday Feb 15th, 9am-1pm</span></li>

<p><strong><i>I'm registered to vote back home, what should I do?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are registered at an address that is NOT in Santa Cruz County, a ballot would have been mailed to that address. If you did not receive a ballot, you will need to visit one of the in-person voting sites, like the Stevenson Event Center on campus, to fill out the conditional voting registration.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong><i>I don&#8217;t know where I am registered, can I look it up online</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. You can go to </span><a href="https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VoterStatus.sos.ca.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and look up your voter information.

<p><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/teaching-week-2024/#ai-forum"><strong>Teaching in the Age of Generative AI</strong></a><strong> &#8212; Feb 28, 2024, 2:30&#8211;4:00 PM (Zoom Only)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does artificial intelligence show up in our classroom? How do we prepare to teach our students to think critically about these new generative models? This joint Academic Senate and TLC forum will create a space to reflect on the challenges, opportunities, and affordances offered by these fast-moving algorithmic technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first part of our program, we&#8217;ll hear from participants in the TLC&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Learning Community, which brought faculty and staff together in a series of regular meetings in the fall quarter to discuss what we were seeing in our classrooms, and to showcase faculty successes in integrating large language models (or LLMs) into teaching practice. We will also hear from students about their perspectives and experiences with AI and learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second part of the program, we&#8217;ll turn our attention to how these Generative Pretrained Transformers are changing our ability to learn how to interact with computational systems. Code is, after all, the native language of artificial intelligence. Our faculty panel will address how AI tools like Copilot are changing the computer science classroom, and how they allow instructors in other non-CS courses to integrate new activities and assignments that previously would have been impossible to teach while also covering course content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be a Zoom event, jointly-sponsored by the TLC and Academic Senate and facilitated by Zac Zimmer, Associate Professor of Literature and Chair of Academic Senate&#8217;s Committee on Information Technology (CIT); Academic Senate, and Michael Tassio, Assistant Vice Provost for Educational Innovation; Teaching and Learning Center.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><a href="https://ucsc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_fAs0a1edSp-2pw1uA3t1AA#/registration">Register to attend (Zoom only).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://tlc.ucsc.edu/teaching-week-2024/#dta-lecture"><strong>Distinguished Teaching Award Lecture: </strong><strong>The Paradox of Authenticity in Teaching and Mentoring</strong></a><strong>&#160; &#8212; Feb 29, 2024, 4:00&#8211;6:30 PM at Merrill Cultural Center&#160; (In-Person and Zoom)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please join us for a conversation about being authentic in our roles as teachers and mentors with Prof. Alegra Eroy-Reveles, the 2022&#8211;23 Distinguished Teaching Awardee and Associate Teaching Professor in the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department. She will be joined by friends Mica Estrada of UC San Francisco and Yuliana Ortega of UC Santa Cruz. The conversation will be facilitated by Yvonne Rodriguez of The Surge Institute. Together they will explore the many paradoxes of joining &#8220;soul and role&#8221; in teaching and mentoring, while also balancing life as Latina mothers and grandmothers. This event is co-sponsored with the Office of the Chancellor and the </span><a href="https://hsi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI) Initiatives.</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Yuliana Ortega</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (BA in Biology and Latin American and Latino Studies from UC Santa Cruz) is the Director of STEM Diversity Programs at UC Santa Cruz working with hundreds of students at the start of their research careers. Born in Oaxaca, Yulianna&#8217;s family went back and forth between Oaxaca and Santa Cruz for much of her childhood until they finally settled permanently in the Santa Cruz area when she was 12 years old. As an undergraduate, she found her preferred balance between science and social justice in the STEM Diversity Programs, which she now directs. She has two children and is currently enrolled in a doctoral program in Educational Leadership at UC Davis. Yulianna was the 2020 UC Santa Cruz Outstanding Staff Awardee for her important roles as leader and mentor to students and beyond.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Mica Estrada</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PhD in Social Psychology from Harvard U) is the Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion and Equity for the School of Nursing and a Professor in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. After completing her doctoral degree, she stepped out of academia for more than 10 years to raise her three children, while also volunteering for nonprofit organizations. She then got back into research working as an adjunct researcher at CSU San Marcos, then later moved to UC San Francisco and is the PI on several NIH grants. Estrada sits on numerous National Academies committees, recognizing her leadership and expertise on issues of undergraduate STEM student retention.&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>Yvonne Rodriguez</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (PhD and BS in Physics from UC Santa Cruz, MBA from Bentley University) is the Director of National Program Impact and Talent for The Surge Institute, which provides leadership acceleration programs for leaders of color who are looking to transform the education space. She also runs her own business as a STEM Equity Coach and Consultant. Rodriguez transferred to UC Santa Cruz from Chabot College along with her three children and completed bachelor&#8217;s and doctoral degrees in Physics. She later earned her MBA and Coaching Certificate. She has worked for various national organizations in science and education, including SACNAS, AWIS, and SWE, providing leadership on how to engage, support, and advance leaders of color.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This initiative aims to encourage and broaden access for California Community College students aspiring to earn UC credits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introduction of a new CCC discount is a pivotal step towards enhancing affordability and accessibility for students on their journey to transfer to a UC campus. By making UC Santa Cruz courses more financially accessible, we hope to empower CCC students and facilitate a smoother transition to their academic goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We believe that education should be inclusive and accessible to all, and our Summer Session is a prime opportunity for students to experience the quality of a UC Santa Cruz education," said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Hughey, Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "The introduction of this tuition discount underscores our commitment to fostering educational opportunities and facilitating seamless transitions for transfer students preparing to embark on their UC journey."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tuition discount is a testament to UC Santa Cruz's dedication to breaking down barriers, fostering diversity, and enriching the educational landscape.&#160;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry said everyone can do something, whether it&#8217;s shopping at farmers markets, growing food or cooking from scratch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We all can think of one thing we can do to help contribute to a more healthy and sustainable food system,&#8221; he said at the close of the two-hour program on Jan. 31 at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His presentation, &#8220;Food Justice: At the Intersection of Food, Politics, Poverty, Public Health, and the Environment,&#8221; was as multidimensional as the title indicated. Terry also gave a cooking demonstration, sang &#8220;Glory, Glory Hallelujah,&#8221; played a recording of his mother singing the hymn backed by a jazz beat, and showed photos of his family, cooking influences, and art. In addition to his many other commitments, Terry is an MFA student at UC Berkeley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program was the first in-person Martin Luther King Jr. Convocation since 2020, something celebrated by Chancellor Cynthia Larive. While she said she appreciated the virtual events held the last three years, she was grateful to gather with everyone again. &#8220;I place great value on being physically together in community with all of you,&#8221; she said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event, which was live streamed and remains available for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogLEJrDVJIs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">viewing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the rest of this month, included performances by Grammy-nominated Santa Cruz singer Tammi Brown and her bandmates as well as the UC Santa Cruz African American Theater Arts Troupe, which presented a scene from </span><a href="https://arts.ucsc.edu/news_events/clydes-lynn-nottage"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clyde&#8217;s</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a play opening February 23.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program commenced with a welcome from Anju Reejhsinghani, Vice Chancellor of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and chair of the MLK Convocation committee, a group of campus and community members who spent several months developing the </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1apidn_TWu8y3awPtv8s4zxwjWcTuu36n/view?pli=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The committee developed a </span><a href="https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6JwIt2fjIE2uFZY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to collect suggestions for speakers and convocation themes in future years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Master of Ceremonies David Anthony III, professor emeritus of African History at UC Santa Cruz, asked the audience to reflect on how the annual convocation has lasted longer than King lived (King was assassinated at age 39). He pointed out that Civil Rights activists Medgar Edvers and Malcom X were also in their 30s when they were killed. &#8220;When you think about 40 for this anniversary, keep that in mind,&#8221; Anthony said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a James Beard Award&#8211;winning chef and author of several critically acclaimed cookbooks. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;included Terry among 11 Smartest People in the Bay Area Food Scene, and&#160;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Company</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;named him one of 9 People Who Are Changing the Future of Food. From 2015 to 2022, Terry served as the inaugural </span><a href="https://www.bryant-terry.com/moad-chef-in-residence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chef-in-Residence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;at the Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD) in San Francisco. In this role, he curated public programming at the intersection of food, farming, health, activism, art, and culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Memphis, Tenn., where King was assassinated in 1968, Terry said he always felt King&#8217;s presence in his life. He credits King&#8217;s radical legacy as an inspiration, particularly his unyielding stance against economic injustice and poverty.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other inspirations that led to Terry&#8217;s career in food justice included the Black Panthers&#8217; Free Breakfast for School Children Program in West Oakland in the 1960s and 1970s, Boogie Down Productions&#8217; 1990 anti-meat-eating song &#8220;Beef&#8221; and Upton Sinclair&#8217;s 1906 muckraking novel on&#160; the meatpacking industry, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Jungle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter two helped turn him into what he said was &#8220;the most judgmental, dogmatic vegan&#8221; ever. &#8220;I apologize to my parents weekly for that period because I was so annoying,&#8221; he said with a laugh.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In retrospect, he said that time of his life taught him an important lesson. &#8220;The least effective way of bringing more people to the table is yelling and screaming at them and making them feel bad for where they are in the journey,&#8221; he said.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sharing his journey, Terry discussed his many books, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afro-Vegan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vegan Soul Kitchen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vegetable Kingdom, and the recently released Black Food, published through his 4 Color imprint with Ten Speed Press/Penguin Random House. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also expanded on his artwork, residency at the Museum of the African Diaspora, and experience as a member of the second cohort of UC Berkeley Abolition Democracy Fellows. Terry said he was touched by the warm welcome he received from students, staff, faculty, and community members at UC Santa Cruz and promised to come back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wrapped up the program with a cooking demonstration of a dish from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afro-Vegan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that included collard greens, Swiss chard, tofu, curry season blends and garlic. &#8220;I like to think about recipes as a tool,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think they should be a structure you could play within.&#8221; He said cooking should &#8220;flow like jazz.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry said he often hears people say they can&#8217;t cook because the process is too time consuming and costly but pointed out that the problems can be alleviated if they prep ingredients in advance and work together.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Capitalism convinces us that every problem - we have to address as an individual,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to get back to more communal ways of cooking and living.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People should also work together to further the food justice movement, which he said is one of the most important movements this century.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need all hands on deck so we can save our earth,&#8221; Terry said, encouraging people to counter the narrative that promotes processed food. &#8220;Time, talent, treasure - whatever you can give, do it.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="807a8b9d80727046796d2b6735a44538"><name>measure-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>The Department of Performance, Play, and Design depends on crucial funds from Measure 11</title><summary>Many are hoping for an adjustment to Measure 11, which dictates the quarterly ticket price for all shows.

Measure 11 which established this price has helped the department pay for its theater productions. Now Measure 11 could be back on the ballot pending approval from the Dean of Students, VC of Student Affairs, the Chancellor&#8217;s cabinet, and the University of California, Office of the President. Hopefully Measure 11 will be back on the ballot for UC Santa Cruz as it aims to raise the quarterly price from $2 by $5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabrina Fogel, the student liaison for the department, took the leading role to push this measure to pass. &#8220;I think it is important that, as a campus community, we can come together and support the arts and artists,&#8221; says Fogel. &#8220;It is my job to represent PPD students and spearhead the movement to add Measure 11 to the ballot this year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in cost is estimated to bring in $262,530</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on student enrollment, although this number may vary based on actual enrollment per quarter in the coming year. Measure 11 will also increase the fee by 3% each year to keep up with inflation until 2030, ending at a price of $5.79 per quarter, at which point funding will be reevaluated. By 2030 the expected funding from this measure will be just over $300,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased revenue is expected to largely pay for productions, given the prices of materials, such as lumber and steel, have greatly increased over the past 20 years. It will also compensate student workers for their labor more equitably. The measure will benefit students in the theater arts by providing them with more resources to create higher value productions, and give them better hands-on education opportunities. It will also grant the larger student body access to experience new and innovative aspects of theater arts on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Official polling of the UCSC student body on the 2023 ballot showed majority support for the new measure, with 64% of students in favor of raising the price. When asked about how high the price should be raised 11% of students were willing to pay $7 more per quarter and 18% were willing to pay $10, but the vast majority were in favor of a $5 increase.&#160;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://theater.ucsc.edu/faculty/chemers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Chemers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the chair of the PPD department, emphasized the importance of performance on the University of California, Santa Cruz campus. "Events enrich the entire UCSC community with high-quality productions that every student can attend for free,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The change to Measure 11 will therefore benefit the whole campus. All we are asking for is a small adjustment to account for inflation over the last 20 years."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Performance, Play, and Design also intends for this measure to benefit diversity on campus given that it will go into promoting cultural performances such as those by </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bayanihan.ucsc/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bayanihan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://losmejicas.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grupo Folklorico Los Mejicas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,and the </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsc_isa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian Student Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If (and, hopefully, when!) Measure 11 passes,&#8221; says Fogel, &#8220;the PPD Department will be able to increase the production value of shows on our campus, leading to larger-scale and higher-quality shows for all UCSC students for free.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department of Performance, Play, and Design puts on an average of six shows per year. The next show, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clyde&#8217;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Lynn Nottage which will be performed by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s African American Theater Arts Troupe, will premiere at the end of February. Though Measure 11 still needs to be passed before it takes effect, similar shows to this will benefit from the increased funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming Measure 11 gets added to the ballot, the election will take place on Monday, May 6th through Friday, May 17th. Voting will take place online at </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">elections.ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Supporters of Measure 11 hope to see it on the ballot so in the future it can bring more money and resources into the department.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="84d2ae578072704655169a8e86a1ce90"><name>cellreports-23</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Bioelectronics enable precise control of organoids for better understanding of neuro diseases, neuron circuits</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz researchers have developed a new plug-and-play bioelectronics system that enables researchers to precisely control neuronal activity in cortical organoids, which will help unlock new discoveries on how brains form neural circuits and the underpinnings of neurodevelopmental and degenerative diseases.</summary><start-date>1707325200000</start-date><display-name>Bioelectronics enable precise control of organoids for better understanding of neuro diseases, neuron circuits</display-name><path>/2024/02/cellreports-23</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/cellreports-23</link><created-by>ecerf</created-by><created-on>1707330416197</created-on><last-modified-by>ecerf</last-modified-by><last-modified>1707430575116</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Electrical Engineering</value><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Genomics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Emily Cerf</name><title></title><phone/><email>ecerf@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/fig1_450b.png</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/fig1_450b.png</link><site>news</site><name>fig1_450b.png</name><display-name>fig1_450b.png</display-name><file-size>257144</file-size><width>450</width><height>350</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/fig1_80.png</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/fig1_80.png</link><site>news</site><name>fig1_80.png</name><display-name>fig1_80.png</display-name><file-size>19268</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>An experimental setup with the plug-and-play bioelectronics system on top of a cell culture plate.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Cortical organoids, which are miniature three-dimensional models of brain tissue grown from stem cells, offer scientists a sophisticated and accurate model to better understand how neurons control brain functioning &#8212; but researchers are still developing methods to perform precise experiments on these delicate models.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://rolandi.soe.ucsc.edu">Rolandi group</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://braingeneers.ucsc.edu">Braingeneers</a> have developed a new plug-and-play bioelectronics system that enables researchers to precisely control neuronal activity in cortical organoids, which will help unlock new discoveries on how brains form neural circuits and the underpinnings of neurodevelopmental and degenerative diseases. Beyond just the study of organoids, their system can be adapted for use in a wide range of biological experiments.&#160;<br/><br/>The research team, with Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Marco Rolandi, Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Mircea Teodorescu, and UCSC Genomics Institute Research Scientist Mohammed Mostajo-Radji as co-senior authors, describe their novel system in a <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-methods/fulltext/S2667-2375(23)00372-7">new paper</a> in the journal <em>Cell Reports Methods</em>. Former UCSC postdoc Yunjeong Park and current UCSC Ph.D. student Sebastian Hernandez led the research as co-first authors.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This work with brain organoids is an important proof-of-concept, because organoids are becoming the standard for looking at how organs are affected by external stimuli,&#8221; Rolandi said.<br/><br/>While organoid models are increasingly popular for the study of brain development, function, and evolution, the methods that currently exist for manipulating the organoids are still fairly unsophisticated, relying on optical methods or rough application of chemicals that do not allow the researchers to precisely control the timing of the manipulations.&#160;<br/><br/>However, the novel methods outlined in this paper enable researchers to use the bioelectronic delivery of ions and neurotransmitters to the models to achieve precise, time-controlled experiments. The system is also easily integrated into existing experiments, as it is simply placed on top of a cell culture plate.<br/><br/>&#8220;This paper brings the ability to manipulate highly-relevant models with high temporal precision,&#8221; Mostajo-Radi said.<br/><br/>Modulating neuronal activity can help scientists better understand the wide range of human diseases that are known to be associated with hyperactivity in certain areas of the brain &#8211; such as Parkinson's disease or epilepsy. Controlling and modulating neuronal activity in brain organoids can help researchers learn more about these conditions and develop better methods of managing and treating them.&#160;<br/><br/>For example, researchers could closely mimic the interaction between drugs and cells that occur in actual treatment by using the highly precise system to see how dose-level amounts of various drugs interact with the cells in an organoid at a defined time. Using tiny amounts of a drug makes the experiments &#8220;reversible&#8221; in that the organoid can return to its original state, which is especially important when researchers are quickly testing how various drugs interact with organoids grown from the stem cells of a patient.<br/><br/>&#8220;Brain cells communicate through both electrical impulses and chemical signals, so using neurons' own "chemical language" could enhance treatment outcomes for specific diseases,&#8221; Hernandez said.&#8221;This can be achieved by utilizing ion pumps as therapeutic devices.&#8221;<br/><br/>Modulating neuronal activity can also help researchers better understand how neural circuits work &#8212; the process by which neuron signals propagate and spread throughout the brain. By slowing down, speeding up, or interrupting a signal using the precise manipulation of ions, the researchers can investigate how signals are transmitted.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;It's like having a dimmer switch for the brain's circuitry, where we can dial up the activity or calm it down,&#8221; Park said. &#8220;This tool opens up new possibilities for exploring how our brains work and develop, potentially revolutionizing our approach to neurological research and treatment."<br/><br/>The bioelectronic system includes an integrated ion pump that can be placed directly on top of a cell culture plate. This modular system makes it easy for scientists to integrate the system into their experiments. In the past, it has been complicated to integrate these types of bioelectronic devices with cell cultures because a researcher would have to grow their cells directly on the device, adding further complexity to the already difficult task of growing organoids.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;Instead here, rather than having the biology adapt to the bioelectronics, we&#8217;ve adapted the bioelectronics to the biology,&#8221; Rolandi said.&#160;<br/><br/>While the researchers focused on the application of their system for organoids in this paper, Rolandi emphasized that the highly modular system can be used in a wide range of biology experiments that would benefit from the precise delivery of ions to a cell plate.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;The importance of the platform is that it goes beyond organoids,&#8221; Rolandi said. &#8220;Any type of biological system &#8212; whether it's an organoid, a cell culture, or a bacteria culture &#8212; chances are it's going to be in a well plate, and our system is plug-and-play, you just put it on top.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="85680adc8072704655169a8e2b944be9"><name>kiribati-seafood-access</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>To plan a sustainable future for seafood access in small island developing states, researchers highlight solutions hiding in plain sight</title><summary>To better understand how fisheries-based food systems might respond to change, a research team led by UCSC Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Katherine Seto took a deeper look at the strategies that people in the small island developing state of Kiribati currently use to access seafood. &#13;

Photo: Getty Images</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the small island developing state of Kiribati is a collection of 33 far-flung tropical islands that are home to more than 126,000 people. Kiribati depends on seafood as a cornerstone of local food systems, but the nation&#8217;s marine resources are increasingly threatened by climate change and other environmental, social, and economic threats.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other nations around the world face similar issues. So, to better understand how fisheries-based food systems might respond to change, researchers took a deeper look at the strategies that people in Kiribati currently use to access seafood.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team&#8217;s findings, published in </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2305424121"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> share lessons from Kiribati, including how different strategies impact local diets, and how successful strategies could potentially be bolstered in the face of growing challenges.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies Katherine Seto led the study, which used machine learning to analyze data from a nationally representative household income and expenditure study and a village resource survey. She says the study&#8217;s focus on understanding current pathways to seafood access lays an important foundation for efforts to ensure stable and sustainable food systems into the future.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are many existing studies around the world that recommend institutional, legal, or technological innovations to improve food systems, but at the same time, there&#8217;s a surprising lack of data on how food that&#8217;s produced in a region actually finds its way into local people&#8217;s diets,&#8221; Seto explained. &#8220;That should really be our starting point, because otherwise, we risk overlooking important local dynamics and proven solutions that are already working for people.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To study this issue, researchers first used computer modeling to determine which of eight access mechanisms&#8212;technology, capital, markets, labor, knowledge, authority, social identity, and social relationships&#8212;had the greatest influence on households in Kiribati that ate the most seafood. The team found that market participation was the most important variable, but it was the households with the lowest market access who tended to eat the most seafood. This is likely because local seafood in Kiribati is often produced and shared non-commercially.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a deeper understanding of which specific combinations of variables led to high-seafood diets in Kiribati, and under which conditions, researchers next performed a cluster analysis. This revealed six main types of households that consumed the highest levels of seafood. The different strategies used by each group also affected the specific kinds of seafood they ate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding which types of households are eating which varieties of seafood is important for assessing the nutritional value, reliability, toxin exposure, and long-term sustainability of diets resulting from each strategy, the paper explains. The findings also have the potential to inform new resource management approaches.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One example we discuss in the paper is that, in Kiribati, sea snails and lagoon and sandflat fish are crucial for households that produce their own seafood, but these animals are much less studied than reef fish and are rarely the focus of management or conservation efforts,&#8221; Seto said. &#8220;So this type of research has the potential to help better align resource management planning with the existing pathways of seafood access.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team&#8217;s findings also offer insights into how broader social and environmental context shape household strategies. Households that produced their own seafood were more male-dominated, while those that relied on purchasing seafood or receiving it as gifts were more female-dominated. Households that focused on low-tech, low-effort methods were disproportionately located in the Line Islands region of Kiribati. And in more urban areas, those who consumed the most seafood were usually either wealthy or received their seafood as gifts, suggesting that social relations may serve as a safety net for seafood access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the largest number of households that attained high levels of seafood consumption did so by receiving seafood as gifts. Seto says this finding demonstrates how traditional market-focused studies of food systems can &#8220;miss crucial pieces of the puzzle&#8221; when it comes to local food security and nutrition. Taking a more holistic approach could result in dramatically different recommendations for ensuring continued seafood access.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, because gifting is a key seafood access mechanism for many households in Kiribati, and gifting takes place primarily through social networks, investing in telecommunications networks or inter-island transportation to increase interpersonal connection could improve seafood access too.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncovering these types of unexpected opportunities for other communities around the world will require continued research to deepen understanding of food access pathways.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rather than assume someone benefits from a resource, we can measure and track these flows of benefit and take seriously the really ingenious approaches that people have for ensuring their household benefits from a resource like seafood,&#8221; Seto said. &#8220;The best policies and management approaches will work to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">support these practices, rather than impose new &#8216;solutions&#8217; to misunderstood problems.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8a0bca15807270464b4c9d1c65afd736"><name>breaking-records-feeding-hope</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Breaking Records and Feeding Hope</title><start-date>1707379200000</start-date><display-name>Breaking Records and Feeding Hope</display-name><path>/2024/02/breaking-records-feeding-hope</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/breaking-records-feeding-hope</link><created-by>sgmessic</created-by><created-on>1707418044924</created-on><last-modified-by>sgmessic</last-modified-by><last-modified>1707418044924</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>*The campus email included incorrect numbers.

<p><span>Greetings, UCSC Students, Faculty, and Staff!<br/><br/>The UCSC Staff Advisory Board is thrilled to share with you that our UCSC community has - once again - broken our own record of generosity!&#160;<br/><br/>This year, we received a huge Holiday Food &amp; Fund Drive matching gift of $50,000 from Tibi McCann and Eric Jensen! Our entire campus community rose to meet this matching gift challenge with:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>$24,567 raised by students</strong></span></li>
<li><span><strong>$38,635 raised by faculty, staff, emeriti, and retirees</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>There was also an anonymous $10,000 donation from a fan of Second Harvest Food Bank (SHFB) who heard of our matching gift and jumped on the UCSC bandwagon!<br/><br/>That&#8217;s a total of about $124,000. Most importantly, that represents about 372,000 meals, which means&#160;<strong>UCSC provided enough food for 339 people to enjoy healthy food all year long - now that&#8217;s feeding hope!</strong>&#160;If that sounds impossible,&#160;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs%3Dc0f8af0790e336612e0675cccb7cefeb9eee0e352143e9ec27536b800dfe3fb2071117fc3d251c61427c72071df24ac4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707501024044000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3DROEDoEJ2DGIgUF3R3b2y" href="https://click.messaging.ucsc.edu/?qs=c0f8af0790e336612e0675cccb7cefeb9eee0e352143e9ec27536b800dfe3fb2071117fc3d251c61427c72071df24ac4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can visit this page</a>&#160;to read how SHFB can feed 1 person for 1 day with $1.<br/><br/>Do you want to keep hope alive all year round?

<ul>
<li><span>Single-person household:&#160; $365</span></li>
<li><span>Two-person household: &#160; &#160; $730</span></li>
<li><span>Three-person household:&#160; $1,095</span></li>
<li><span>Four-person household:&#160; &#160; $1,460</span></li>

Due to the quick turnaround time, we submitted and were approved for a spending plan developed by Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Anju Reejhsinghani and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Akirah Bradley-Armstrong. Some critical and urgent climate issues funded include culturally congruent support services for students and synchronous and asynchronous training for faculty and staff on Islamophobia, antisemitism and other forms of hate.&#160;</span><br/><br/><span>We are now requesting faculty and staff ideas and feedback for Phase 2.

We welcome ideas that address the needs and aspirations of our community given the ongoing impact of global and domestic events.

This poignant show by two-time Pulitzer Prize winning playwright, </span><a href="http://www.lynnnottage.com/about.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynn Nottage,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells the story about the staff at a diner that, despite being downtrodden by their boss, is encouraged to pursue their dreams by the chef who is on the search for the perfect sandwich. "T<span>he thing I'm most excited about is sharing the story of people looking for redemption," says Tavion Collins, one of the actors in the show.&#160;</span>This lighthearted comedy captures the struggles and nuances of race and incarceration.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clyde&#8217;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> originally premiered at the Guthrie theater in Minneapolis, before making its way to Broadway&#8217;s Second Stage Theater in 2021. Lynn Nottage&#8217;s work often focuses on the working class, especially those who are African American. Before </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clyde&#8217;s </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she won Pulitzer Prizes for drama in both 2005 and 2017 along with numerous other accolades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This production will be presented by the African American Theater Arts Troupe (AATAT), an on-campus performing arts group which strives to have a direct effect on quality of life for African American students by exposing UC Santa Cruz to African American theater.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with on-campus productions, AATAT works with the local community through organizations including the Santa Cruz Arts Commission and the Community Partnership for Youth, and raises funds for scholarships to help support students. Through a combination of workshops, scholarships, lectures, and outreach, AATAT gives voice to African American students, and educates the community about the history and importance of Black theater arts.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clyde&#8217;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is directed by Don Williams, a senior professor for the Department of Performance, Play, and Design who has been teaching for the department for over 30 years while focusing on the representation of BIPOC representation in theater.

<p><strong>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (February 9, 2024</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">) &#8212; On Saturday, March 2, 2024, the students of the UCSC Central Asian Ensemble will present folk and traditional music from Uzbekistan with special guest master-dutarist Rozibi Khodjaeva.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This performance is culmination of a month-long residency that Khodjaeva is engaged in at the University of California, Santa Cruz, including rehearsals with the ensemble, meeting with graduate students, and lectures/demonstrations at UCLA and University of Colorado, Boulder, while she is in the United States.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanya Merchant, an associate professor of music at UC Santa Cruz, started the Asian Ensemble (formerly the Eurasian Ensemble) in 2008 with the goal of educating students on music outside of the western canon. Her two-credit course teaches students about the dutar, a two stringed instrument that is traditional in Iranian and other Central Asian musical traditions.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only dutar ensemble outside of Central Asia, Merchant is &#8220;super proud&#8221; of her students, especially the ten new members who spent the first four weeks of this quarter learning their first song. &#8220;To see how far absolute non-musical beginners can go in 11 weeks is super exciting,&#8221; says Merchant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The March performance will showcase music both from Merchant&#8217;s beginning students, followed by music majors who she has taught before. Finishing off with her and a special guest Rozibi Khodjaeva.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khodjaeva taught Merchant how to play dutar in the early 2000s. The two met when Merchant stayed in Uzbekistan while studying ethnomusicology at UCLA with a focus in Uzbek music. While there Merchant also worked as part of Khodjaeva&#8217;s wedding band, playing the drums, often for gender segregated wedding events which are common in Uzbek traditions. &#8220;I have such fond memories of spending all this time on her balcony,&#8221; says Merchant, &#8220;drinking tea and learning the dutar and working together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchant and Khodjaeva had not seen each other for 15 years before joining together for this special residency. Although there was an attempt to bring Khodjaeva to the U.S. in March of 2020, that did not work out. Khodjaeva is currently here on a work visa and the pair are also playing shows in Denver, Boulder, and Los Angeles between flying back and working on lessons at UC Santa Cruz. Khodjaeva has been assisting with the Central Asia Ensemble despite not knowing any english. &#8220;It is wonderful to see how people who don't share language can still share music,&#8221; says Merchant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concert will also feature Tara Pandeya, an internationally recognized dancer who has worked with Cirque du Soleil and is the first Westerner to dance with the Tajik State Ensemble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This upcoming performance showcases UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s focus on diversity and promoting the voices of those who are underrepresented. Khodjaeva and Padeya, as international experts in the world of music and dance, encapsulate diversity around the world and on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the culmination of more than 20 years of collaboration between this master musician and I,&#8221; says Merchant. &#8220;I'm really excited that all of these wonderful people can come together and play music together.&#8221;</span></p>

</article-subhead><article-text>As you scroll through any social media feed, you are likely to be prompted to follow or friend another person, expanding your personal network and contributing to the growth of the app itself. The person suggested to you is a result of link prediction: a widespread machine learning (ML) task that evaluates the links in a network &#8212; your friends and everyone else&#8217;s &#8212; and tries to predict what the next links will be.<br/><br/>Beyond being the engine that drives social media expansion, link prediction is also used in a wide range of scientific research, such as predicting the interaction between genes and proteins, and is used by researchers as a benchmark for testing the performance of new ML algorithms. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312527121">New research</a> from UC Santa Cruz Professor of Computer Science and Engineering C. &#8220;Sesh&#8221; Seshadhri published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> establishes that the metric used to measure link prediction performance is missing crucial information, and link prediction tasks are performing significantly worse than popular literature indicates. <br/><br/>Seshadhri and his coauthor Nicolas Menand, who is a former UCSC undergraduate and masters student and a current Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, recommend that ML researchers stop using the standard practice metric for measuring link prediction, known as AUC, and introduce a new, more comprehensive metric for this problem. The research has implications for trustworthiness around decisionmaking in ML.<br/><br/><strong>AUC&#8217;s ineffectiveness</strong><br/><br/>Seshadhri, who works in the fields of theoretical computer science and data mining and is currently an Amazon scholar, has done previous research on ML algorithms for networks. In this previous work he found certain mathematical limitations that were negatively impacting algorithm performance, and in an effort to better understand the mathematical limitations in context, dove deeper into link prediction due to its importance as a testbed problem for ML algorithms. <br/><br/>&#8220;The reason why we got interested is because link prediction is one of these really important scientific tasks which is used to benchmark a lot of machine learning algorithms,&#8221; Seshadhri said. &#8220;What we were seeing was that the performance seemed to be really good&#8230; but we had an inkling that there seemed to be something off with this measurement. It feels like if you measured things in a different way, maybe you wouldn&#8217;t see such great results.&#8221;<br/><br/>Link prediction is based on the ML algorithm&#8217;s ability to carry out low dimensional vector embeddings, the process by which the algorithm represents the people within a network as a mathematical vector in space. All of the machine learning occurs as mathematical manipulations to those vectors. <br/><br/>AUC, which stands for &#8220;area under curve&#8221; and is the most common metric for measuring link prediction, gives ML algorithms a score from zero to one based on the algorithm's performance. <br/><br/>In their research, the authors discovered that there are fundamental mathematical limitations to using low dimensional embeddings for link predictions, and that AUC can not measure these limitations. The inability to measure these limitations caused the authors to conclude that AUC does not accurately measure link prediction performance.<br/><br/>Seshadhri said these results call into question the widespread use of low dimensional vector embeddings in the ML field, considering the mathematical limitations that his research has surfaced on their performance. <br/><br/><strong>Leading methods fall short </strong><br/><br/>The discovery of AUC&#8217;s shortcomings led the researchers to create a new metric to better capture the limitations, which they call VCMPR. They used VCMPR to measure 12 ML algorithms chosen to be representative of the field, including algorithms such as DeepWalk, Node2vec, NetMF, GraphSage, and graph benchmark leader HOP-Rec, and found that the link prediction performance was worse using VCMPR as the metric rather than AUC. <br/><br/>&#8220;When we look at the VCMPR scores, we see that the scores of most of the leading methods out there are really poor,&#8221; Seshadhri said. &#8220;It looks like they're actually not doing a good job when you measure things a different way.&#8221; <br/><br/>The results also showed that not only was performance lower across the board, some of the algorithms that performed worse than other algorithms when measured with AUC in turn performed better than the cohort with VCMPR, and vice versa. <br/><br/><strong>Trustworthiness in machine learning </strong><br/><br/>Seshadhri suggests that ML researchers use VCMPR to benchmark the link prediction performance of their algorithms, or at the very least stop using AUC as their measure. As metrics are so tightly connected to decision making in ML, using a flawed system to measure performance could lead to flawed decision making about which algorithms to employ in real world ML applications. <br/><br/>&#8220;Metrics are so closely tied to what we decide to deploy in the real world &#8212; people need to have some trust in that. If you have the wrong way of measuring, how can you trust the results?&#8221; Seshadri said. &#8220;This paper is in some sense cautionary: we have to be more careful about how we do our machine learning experiments, and we need to come up with a richer set of measures.&#8221; <br/><br/>In academia, using an accurate metric is crucial to creating progress in the ML field.<br/><br/>&#8220;This is in some sense a bit of a conundrum for scientific progress. A new result has to supposedly be better than everything previously, otherwise it's not doing anything new &#8212; but that all depends on how you measure it.&#8221; <br/><br/>Beyond machine learning, there are researchers across a wide range of fields who use link prediction and ML to conduct their research, often with profound potential impact. For example, some biologists use link prediction to determine which proteins are likely to interact as a part of drug discovery. These biologists and other researchers outside of ML depend on the ML experts to create trustworthy tools, as they often cannot become ML experts themselves. <br/><br/>While he thinks these results may not be a huge surprise to those deeply involved in the field, he hopes that the larger community of ML researchers, and particularly graduate and Ph.D. students who use the current literature to learn best practices and common wisdom about the field, will take note of these results and take caution in their work. He sees this research that presents a skeptical view to be in somewhat contrast to a dominant philosophy in ML, which tends to accept a set of metrics and focuses on &#8220;pushing the bar&#8221; when it comes to progress in the field.<br/><br/>&#8220;It's important that we have the skeptical view, are trying to understand deeper, and are constantly asking ourselves &#8216;Are we measuring things correctly?&#8217;&#8221;<br/><br/>This research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the Army Research Office.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9f4abc188072704624a3786430e7fac4"><name>after-man</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>After Man: Alterhuman Ethics and Poetics at the Climate Change Tipping Point</title><summary>Join associate professor micha cárdenas for her talk about the meeting point between the end of humanity and contemporary art.</summary><description>Join associate professor micha cárdenas for her talk about the meeting point between the end of humanity and contemporary art.</description><start-date>1707724800000</start-date><display-name>After Man: Alterhuman Ethics and Poetics at the Climate Change Tipping Point</display-name><path>/2024/02/after-man</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/after-man</link><created-by>gmessino</created-by><created-on>1707774491651</created-on><last-modified-by>asoergel</last-modified-by><last-modified>1707930881005</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2.jpg</name><display-name>oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2.jpg</display-name><file-size>69291</file-size><width>760</width><height>281</height></image><image-alt>Image courtesy of micha cárdenas</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>oceanic-queering-the-ocean-still-2-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>8315</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An Art, Technology, and Culture Colloquium Lecture, presented as part of BCNM's Latinx &amp;

Design, University of California, Santa Cruz</p>
<p>This talk takes a systemic, global approach to respond to the challenges facing humanity, following Sylvia Wynter in asking if humanity is coming to an end, or if it has already ended, if it ever was. Looking at contemporary art and global art exhibitions in the time of Covid-19 and accelerating climate catastrophe, this talk asks what the role is for art and the humanities in a time in which many have asked if we are seeing the horizon of humanity. What emerges is a clearer picture of the stakes of socially engaged art that is decolonial and in dialogue with activist movements. Using a practice-based approach that considers exhibitions from the perspective of an artist, combined with algorithmic analysis that focuses on process, operations, and ritual, this talk proposes poetic and aesthetic strategies for working towards sustainable, livable futures beyond colonial conceptions of man. Learning from Wynter, Donna Haraway, and Maria Puig de la Bellacasa, c&#225;rdenas proposes the term alterhuman. She will discuss her book <em>Atoms Never Touch</em>, as well as her newer artworks <em>Sin Sol, Oceanic,</em> and <em>The Probability Engine</em>, which she is currently creating with the Critical Realities Studio.</p>

We have rebounded from the challenges we faced during COVID and the campus continues to be on the rise. We are committed to maintaining that trajectory and overcoming known and unknown challenges we will face along the way.</span></p>
<p><span>As you may know, Governor Gavin Newsom&#8217;s January state budget announcement for fiscal year 2025 highlighted continuing budget deficit projections. The governor&#8217;s announcement included deferrals of the 5% state funding increase negotiated in the Compact between the University of California and the governor, along with deferrals of various one-time funds. Within this overall context of uncertain financial conditions for the state budget, campus leadership has been involved in discussions to address a projected growing structural deficit in our core budget in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span>Structural deficits occur when the campus collectively, and for a variety of reasons, including unfunded mandates, spends more than the revenue received each year, over a number of years. For several years, we were able to cover those expenses with one-time funds and campus reserves, but that approach is not sustainable. While in the longer term, the financial picture for both the state budget and the campus budget will rebound, we must act deliberately now to begin closing the annual gap between revenue and expenses. We are actively pursuing ways to increase revenue; however, the reality is that much of the effort will need to be focused on reducing expenses. UC Santa Cruz is not alone in having to address such issues; most of the other UC campuses are facing similar challenges.</span></p>
<p><span>The 2023&#8211;24 budget (based on anticipated revenue) for UC Santa Cruz is just over $1 billion, of which approximately $530 million is in core funds. The projected annual budget gap for this fiscal year (FY24) is projected to be -$96 million and may grow to -$122 million in FY25 if we don&#8217;t take timely action. These projections will be regularly revised based on actual revenue and expenses, and a better understanding of unit spending plans, as the year progresses. To address these projected shortfalls, we are taking some steps to reduce expenses for the remainder of FY24, and then turning to the FY25 budget development process.</span></p>
<p><span>We have communicated with campus principal officers about our FY24 expense reduction steps, which include reducing discretionary spending; shifting core funds spending to non-core funds where possible; conducting further analysis of year-end (carryforward) balances; and proceeding with staff hiring for only the most critically needed positions. Non-core funds (contracts and grants, auxiliaries, sales and service, student fee referenda, miscellaneous fees, etc.) and formal state funded line-items (climate initiative, basic needs, etc.) are not held to these measures.</span></p>
<p><span>For some of you who have experienced challenging budget times at the UC before, you likely hold a variety of memories from those experiences. It is our intention to guide this process in as clear of a way as possible. As we further develop steps to address our structural deficit, we will follow these guiding principles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Transparency about our financial position and decisions is critical as we work together to achieve a balanced budget. We will all communicate often and clearly with campus stakeholders, including sharing information via a website.</span></li>
<li><span>We should actively seek efforts to reduce spending in ways that are aligned with our campus goals and prioritize maintaining our academic mission of delivering a quality education, producing impactful research, scholarship and creative activities, and making a public service contribution.</span></li>
<li><span>Actions taken now to align our spending with available resources should be future-focused and position the campus for longer-term success in achieving our goals and executing on our mission.</span></li>
<li><span>As we develop future budgets, the larger context should be taken into account in evaluating budget adjustment proposals as there are important interrelationships between decisions made in one unit that may have significant unintended impacts on others.</span></li>
<li><span>Adjustments in the way we allocate resources present opportunities to think anew about our practices and processes, and take advantage of tools that can improve our efficiency and collaborative sharing of resources in ways that reduce costs and improve effectiveness and resiliency.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As written earlier, we know that the campus cannot rely on reductions alone to establish a firmer financial position. We also will pursue opportunities for additional revenue streams. A task force, led by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Success Akirah Bradley-Armstrong and Associate Vice Chancellor for Financial Affairs Biju Kamaleswaran will be established and charged with developing ideas to increase revenues and soliciting and reviewing suggestions from the entire campus community.</span></p>
<p><span>We should all take great pride in what we have achieved over the past five years&#8211;advancing student success, increasing our research impact, and much more. And while these necessary financial actions will be a challenge, through thoughtful decision making now, the campus will be well-positioned to take advantage of the extraordinary opportunities to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your ongoing partnership. Further information on the financial position of the university and how we are bringing it to a more balanced state will be provided soon on the campus&#8217;s Budget Analysis and Planning website.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Staff and Faculty</audience><admin>Cynthia Larive Chancellor and Lori Kletzer Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9fa4b8618072704624a3786472a622fa"><name>kortney-ryan-ziegler</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Innovation at the intersection: An alum’s trailblazing ventures in tech, film, and social change</title><summary>Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler is an award-winning tech entrepreneur, a filmmaker and producer, a social justice advocate, and a scholar. </summary><start-date>1707778800000</start-date><display-name>kortney-ryan-ziegler</display-name><path>/2024/02/kortney-ryan-ziegler</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/kortney-ryan-ziegler</link><created-by>hzain</created-by><created-on>1707780388940</created-on><last-modified-by>hzain</last-modified-by><last-modified>1707781100840</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Film and Digital Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name><value>Alumni Profile</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Haneen Zain</name><title></title><phone/><email>hzain@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/dr-kortney-ziegler-lead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/dr-kortney-ziegler-lead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dr-kortney-ziegler-lead.jpg</name><display-name>dr-kortney-ziegler-lead.jpg</display-name><file-size>127142</file-size><width>450</width><height>450</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/dr-kortney-ziegler-thumbnail.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/dr-kortney-ziegler-thumbnail.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dr-kortney-ziegler-thumbnail.jpg</name><display-name>dr-kortney-ziegler-thumbnail.jpg</display-name><file-size>17007</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler (Porter &#8217;03, film and digital media)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler on using tech for social good </article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler&#8217;s expertise spans across multiple disciplines. Ziegler (Porter &#8217;03, film and digital media), is an award-winning tech entrepreneur, filmmaker, producer, social justice advocate, and scholar. Since graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 2003, he has founded four applications and platforms that address social issues head-on and provide solutions for them. These platforms include:&#160;</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Trans*H4ck (TransHack) (2013)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A two-and-a-half-day hackathon held in Oakland that invited transgender hackers and developers to come together and create software. The hackathon spotlighted the trans tech community, often underrepresented in the field. Although the hackathon is no longer active, its impact is still felt today.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ariel Spaces (2014)</strong><span>: A virtual event platform that hosted educational webinars. In 2016, Ariel Spaces partnered with the White House to deliver digital education to 20,000 students from underserved communities. Ziegler&#8217;s company had also worked with Microsoft to create online education tools for students.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Appolition (2017)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Roughly 60 percent of people in jail awaiting trial are there because they can&#8217;t afford bail, which in many cases is just a few hundred dollars. Appolition allows users to set up automatic payments to fund a person&#8217;s bail. In its first year, Appolition attracted 8,000 users and raised about $140,000 &#8212; securing the release of 45 people nationwide.&#160;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://well-money.com/"><strong>WellMoney</strong></a><strong> (2021)</strong><span>: &#8220;Get money in emergencies. Give money when you can.&#8221; WellMoney is a community-driven application that allows users to request money for emergencies such as housing costs, car repairs, health needs, groceries, and more. Users can set up monthly payments to contribute to WellMoney&#8217;s emergency fund.&#160;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overarching theme: Ziegler is a social engineer increasing representation, prosperity, and community through tech. He has won multiple awards for his work. He was named among the Top 40 Under 40 LGBT activists by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Advocate Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the most influential African Americans of 2013 by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">TheRoot100</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and was listed in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diablo Magazine&#8217;s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Top 40 Under 40 in 2017. His work with Trans*H4ck earned him an Innovation Award and a Nominet Trust 100 award in 2014.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler says his work is inspired by his personal life and lived experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think I&#8217;m very blessed to have known my purpose in life as a young soul, young human being, and I&#8217;ve been very much in tune with that,&#8221; Ziegler said. &#8220;And I&#8217;m very lucky to meet people who I know are part of my journey to help me build awesome things. I&#8217;m going with the flow and know that I&#8217;m here to use the resources and access that I have, and also, I think a lot of my intellect, to help people who may not be able to help themselves in a number of ways.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler, a Black transgender man, grew up in Compton under challenging circumstances. He was raised by a family of single women and was exposed to multiple facets of abuse inflicted by extended family members. He was the first in his family to attend college. As a freshman at UC Santa Cruz, Ziegler took race and women&#8217;s studies courses that he says gave him the critical tools to reject harmful messages surrounding race, gender, and sexuality. In his third year of Ph.D. studies at Northwestern, Ziegler started identifying as gender queer and began his transition.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all of his platforms, Ziegler says that he resonated with Trans*H4ck the most.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was my first venture into being an entrepreneur in the technology industry, and it showed that I could do it without even working in the industry. I didn&#8217;t know anybody professionally working at tech companies. I had to learn how to put those fears aside and do what I needed to do. Now, some years later, it&#8217;s like, &#8216;wow, I&#8217;ve been able to build multiple things because of that one platform.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler started the two-and-a-half-day hackathon with the hope that the platform would empower the lives of trans people financially, socially, and emotionally. Although Trans*H4ck is no longer active, its impact is still felt today.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It went like wildfire; so many organizations were coming out and emulating Trans*H4ck. Policy was shifted, and tech companies started driving bathroom conversations and medical conversations and began hiring more trans employees. Trans*H4ck also became the spark for trans people in tech who never thought that we could work in technology. They went to the first-ever Trans*H4ck, and many became successful software engineers or technical founders. So it was an amazing experience.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a B.A. in film and digital media and a minor in computer science in 2003. He says that his time at UCSC played a crucial role in his development and in becoming who he is today.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am very grateful for the experience because it has shaped everything in my life since then: professionally, personally, and in a very good way. As a young person, my first time away from home, I made amazing friends from all over the state and the country, and I got to walk away with a film degree. I became a filmmaker and could transfer the practical skills I got from the film and digital media degree to my personal work. UCSC really started my academic journey as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after graduating, Ziegler founded ZaMLabs (formerly Black Star Media) and produced the multi-award-winning documentary </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still Black: a portrait of black transmen in 2008</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which follows the diverse stories of six trans men. The film received an Isaac Julien Experimental Award from Queer Black Cinema International Music Festival and an Audience Choice Award for Best Documentary in the ReelOut Queer Film + Video Festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2005, Ziegler earned his M.A. in ethnic studies with a concentration in Black studies from San Francisco State University and a Master&#8217;s in African-American and Black studies from Northwestern in 2008. He became the first to graduate with a Ph.D. in African American Studies from Northwestern in 2011.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Ziegler works as the CEO of WellMoney and as a tech entrepreneur with Ideas42. He spends most of his time fundraising for WellMoney and enjoys going to the gym and spending time with his fiance.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziegler&#8217;s advice for current UCSC students looking to make meaningful impact and change in their communities: &#8220;Do it.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think people who go to UCSC are already aware that their presence is doing something good for California and our country as future intellectual scholars. I&#8217;ve never in my life let lack of money, where I come from, who I am, or what I look like stop me from ever achieving or pursuing things that I want to do. And I would encourage everybody else to do the same.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a35867338072704624a3786419c924d0"><name>frank-andrews</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Frank Andrews, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry</title><summary>With enormous gratitude, we celebrate the life of UC Santa Cruz Professor Emeritus Frank Andrews, who died of cancer on January 31, 2024, at age 91. </summary><start-date>1707811200000</start-date><path>/2024/02/frank-andrews</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/frank-andrews</link><created-by>ajbutler</created-by><created-on>1707842496287</created-on><last-modified-by>ajbutler</last-modified-by><last-modified>1707842496287</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/frank-andrews.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/frank-andrews.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>frank-andrews.jpeg</name><display-name>frank-andrews.jpeg</display-name><file-size>47797</file-size><width>384</width><height>384</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/frank-andrews1.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/frank-andrews1.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>frank-andrews1.jpeg</name><display-name>frank-andrews.jpeg</display-name><file-size>3657</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With enormous gratitude, we celebrate the life of University of California, Santa Cruz Professor Emeritus Frank Andrews, who died of cancer on January 31, 2024, at age 91.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank joined UC Santa Cruz in 1967 as a tenured professor. Although he officially retired in 2006, he continued to teach classes until 2017. During his remarkable career spanning over five decades, he inspired thousands of students through his teaching of chemistry, human values, and personal empowerment.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One student reflected, &#8220;Frank challenged me to become a better person in my life. I gained the inspiration and passion to make my life a better one to live. I learned what I want out of life. There is nothing more I want from a course than that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank was born on May 29, 1932, in Manhattan, Kansas, home to Kansas State University (KSU), where his father was on the faculty and his mother was an alum and valedictorian. He attended KSU and was drawn to math, physics, and chemistry and also became a valedictorian. He earned a Fulbright fellowship in 1954, which took him to the University of Hull in England where he studied advanced mathematics.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank was drafted into the United States Army in 1955, as the Korean War was winding down. He served in Houston, Texas, conducting background interviews for candidates for security clearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank then went to graduate school at Harvard University, and traveled to Brussels to work under Ilya Prigogine, Nobel Laureate. He earned a Ph.D. in theoretical chemistry, in an unusually rapid three years. He worked as a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley under Dudley Herschbach, also a Nobel Laureate. He joined the faculty at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1961, where he was an assistant professor of chemistry for six years, then came to UC Santa Cruz in 1967.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank was very excited to be coming to the new, experimental campus here in Santa Cruz. At UC Santa Cruz, Frank&#8217;s passion for teaching and deep love and care for students flourished. Eventually, his focus on students&#8217; psychological health inspired him to earn a masters degree in Clinical Psychology.</span></p>
<p><strong>Transformed by His Students</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon arriving at UC Santa Cruz, Frank and his wife Jean took up a post as </span><a href="https://crown50reunion.org/frank-andrews/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">residential preceptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Rutherford House, a Crown College dorm. Living with students for five years in the late 1960s and early 1970s allowed Frank to see their passions, potential, and struggles first-hand.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I fell in love with the students. Here were these brilliant, powerful kids,&#8221; Frank recounted in his </span><a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/andrews"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2014 oral history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#8220;and yet they didn&#8217;t seem to be able to enjoy their lives very well and they didn&#8217;t seem to be fulfilling their intellectual potential.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This realization permanently expanded Frank&#8217;s focus as a university professor. In addition to helping students understand the complexity of chemistry, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2013/11/frank-andrews.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he turned much of his attention to the complexity of being human</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, observing that unplanned student pregnancies were a frequent occurrence in the dorms, Frank began offering a sex education lecture when the students arrived in the fall, a fairly radical move for the time. The need for the information was great and the lectures were very well attended.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through his three signature courses, Teaching Science in the University (Chem 137), Solving Problems/Personal Empowerment (NatSci 120/Merrill 120), and Science and Human Values/Examining Our Life through Writing (Chem 80B/Crown 123), Frank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentored students in how best to &#8220;experience more control over our lives, to choose and solve problems which lead to our own long-term satisfaction and to the enrichment of our society, and to create and experience community and mutual support.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Open Doors</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, Frank and Jean frequently invited students into their apartment in Crown, a practice which they continued when they moved to their current home on the westside of Santa Cruz. &#8220;My parents were an amazing team, welcoming countless students into our home,&#8221; said their daughter, Karen Andrews. &#8220;Together they fed, counseled, consoled, advised, taught, cheered, and healed them, acting as friends, pastors, parents, and grandparents. Students craved and deeply appreciated their wise counsel and unconditional acceptance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three times each week Frank walked to campus and back, a three-mile, uphill trek</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He kept extensive office hours and had a large comfortable sofa next to his desk for students to sit on. For the times he wasn&#8217;t in his office, he placed his home phone number on the outside of his door that encouraged students to &#8220;call with problems&#8221; of any kind. Generations of students did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz alum Christopher Snow commented, &#8220;When you walk into his office (and his door is always open) you know he&#8217;s really interested in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he&#8217;s not going to start shuffling papers in 30 seconds, as if to tell you how busy he is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Teaching</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank summarized his educational philosophy in the UC Santa Cruz publication he founded, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher on the Hill</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &#8220;I work to see each student as a marvelous human whose suffering or rejoicing is as important as the suffering or rejoicing of anyone else &#8211; regardless of how well they do in my classes. I want people to be able to make choices and live with the consequences of those choices. If those choices lead them to stress some other class while slighting mine, so be it. I believe that what is important is the meta-education: &#8216;what you have left when you&#8217;ve forgotten everything you learned in school.&#8217; I want what people have left to include good feelings about themselves as worthwhile, responsible, choosing people who count for something.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank won numerous teaching awards, both on campus and from outside organizations, including the UC Santa Cruz Distinguished Teaching Award in 1991. In addition to his dedication to student well-being, he was also extremely skilled at the craft of teaching traditional academic content in his general chemistry and thermodynamics classes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even students who only encountered Frank in his large introductory Chem 1A class often described the experience as transformative.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank pioneered an alternative model of teaching lower division chemistry students in which upper division science majors mentored study sections. The peer mentors would simultaneously enroll in &#8220;Teaching Science in the University&#8221; (Chem 137), and receive a weekly seminar on teaching at Frank&#8217;s home, which included homemade desserts from Jean. While controversial at the time, peer teaching programs have since been adopted widely and are accepted as highly effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous Chem 137 students went on to become transformative teachers themselves, and credit Frank with inspiring and supporting them on their path, as well as role-modeling the type of profound difference teachers can make. One of Frank&#8217;s many teaching prot&#233;g&#233;s, UC Santa Cruz alum Michael Morgan, went on to win countless awards as a chemistry teacher at a low-income high school in Los Angeles. In 2017, Morgan decided </span><a href="https://plannedgifts.ucsc.edu/?pageID=3&amp;storyNum=15"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to endow a chair at UC Santa Cruz in Frank&#8217;s honor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The chair will be focused on excellence in science education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We spend far too little time on the values implications of the material taught,&#8221; Frank wrote in a 1972 critique of the educational system. From this initial concern, Frank began experimenting with another class, which he first called &#8220;The Phenomenon of Man,&#8221; then &#8220;Science and Human Values&#8221; (Chem 80B), and eventually evolved into &#8220;Examining Our Life Through Writing&#8221; (Crown 123). Found in the appendix of his </span><a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/andrews"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oral history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the syllabus of this class outlined a series of writing exercises, ranging from exploring each student&#8217;s highest values, reflecting on death and dying while writing a living will, and writing a retrospective positive vision of their entire life. In addition to the longer writing assignments, he required students to write 10-minute &#8220;free-writes&#8221; at the end of each class meeting. He always read and responded to all of them, an astonishing feat for a class of 40 to 60 students that met three times a week!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to overstate the impact that his </span><a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/support-us/images/syllabus-personal-empowerment.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solving Problems/ Personal Empowerment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> class had on the many groups of students fortunate enough to take the class. In the course description, he wrote: &#8220;The following topics will receive special focus: Problems, purposes, and goals; Meaning in life; Romantic and other relationships; The steps of solving problems; What&#8217;s it all for, and how do you experience love, gratitude, caring, community, concern, delight, enthusiasm, joy, sensitivity, surrender, and wonder in the process of it all.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on his own participation in this class, son-in-law Chris Lay urged everyone to &#8220;take the time to </span><a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/support-us/images/syllabus-personal-empowerment.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read the whole syllabus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this class and reflect on how your life might change if you integrated even part of what he laid out in it. The description, the agreements, the exercises, and of course his masterful facilitation of the class stands as a powerful example of humanity at its finest.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After one of his Solving Problems classes ended in spring of 1987, his students were so closely bonded with one another that they decided to keep meeting each week. When Frank and Jean returned from vacation that summer, the students invited them to join the newly formed group. Thirty-seven years later that support/problem-solving/advice group still meets weekly in the Andrews&#8217; home.</span></p>
<p><strong>Campus Leadership</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When UC Santa Cruz was just a few years old, Frank influenced foundational policies and programs as a member of the campus Committee on Education Policy, the UC Santa Cruz and state-wide Academic Senates, and the Committee on Narrative Evaluations. Frank helped promote the creation of the Environmental Studies Department, as well many other interdisciplinary programs, independent majors, and similar efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank was the key advocate for removing the &#8220;F&#8221; from UC Santa Cruz transcripts, replacing it with a Pass/No Record system. He saw how devastating a single bad grade could be to a student&#8217;s future, and believed that students with tremendous talent and potential were being unnecessarily held back by traditional grading systems. He was a strong champion for the narrative evaluation system, supporting its continued existence within UC Santa Cruz for as long as he was able.</span></p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank was an avid reader and his intellectual interests evolved over his career. He delved into educational theory when he came to UC Santa Cruz. He gleaned ideas from the human potential movement. He also read extensively from many of the great minds of Eastern thought. He wrote constantly, working out and refining his ideas, creating handouts for his classes, innumerable graduation speeches, and serving as the editor of the campus publication, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher on the Hill</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which featured fourteen editions in the 1970s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank authored three textbooks on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics early in his career, followed by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Art and Practice of Loving</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><a href="http://www.heartfeltyes.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free download or bound copy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Choosing-Your-Way-Through-Life/dp/1662465653/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing Your Way through Life</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-authored with UC Santa Cruz alum Ron Richardson.&#160;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Art and Practice of Loving</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was translated into six languages and remained in print with its original publisher for over twenty years. Amazon reviewer Steven wrote, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is my favorite book of all time. It teaches you the most important lessons you can learn in life &#8211; how to love in every moment.&#8221; The book has been used in numerous classes and groups throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout Frank&#8217;s career, writings, and personal life, he thought deeply about his highest values and how to live by them. As his daughter, Elizabeth Andrews, recalled, &#8220;Dad continually looked for ways to to turn the mundane into the sacred. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When teaching general chemistry, he took a standard footnote about academic honesty and turned it into an inspiring lecture about your highest values and the meaning of your university education. When playing the piano he challenged himself to let go of being note-perfect and on tempo and to fall in love with the music, the sound of the piano, and the emotional flow the composer might have been expressing. When staring at a lawn full of dandelions, he didn&#8217;t see a patch of weeds, or a to-do list item, but a field of bright yellow flowers. When talking to a student struggling with whether to be a businessman like their parents wanted, or a teacher like they wanted, my dad encouraged them to follow their heart, and surrounded them with reasons and approval for doing so. And when students struggled with the pains of life &#8211; the challenges of abuse, disappointment, breakups, roommate issues, financial hardship, health problems, etc. &#8211; my father encouraged them to think of their problems as &#8216;Another F-ing Growth Opportunity&#8217; &#8211; or AFGO.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his </span><a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/support-us/images/frank-andrews-wedding-speech-1999.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1999 address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the wedding of his daughter Elizabeth and son-in-law Chris, he articulated his philosophy that &#8220;love is a heartfelt &#8216;yes,&#8217;&#8221; a choice we can make in every moment. We do this so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that &#8220;when we are finished on this planet, each of us will know we have loved, cared, and served, that we have truly lived as we were meant to live.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last forty years of his life, including through his worsening dementia, Frank practiced gratitude daily. In his </span><a href="https://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/andrews"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2014 oral history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Frank reflected, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was fortunate beyond belief&#8212;every aspect of my life, the way it ended up, ended up wonderfully for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High school teacher James Colligan reflected on Frank&#8217;s legacy: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be who I am today unless you [Jean] and Frank had taken me under your wing, and shared your home and your family and your dinner table with me&#8230;. How do you thank someone for that? I suppose I say, thank you. But I also want you to know that I pay it forward, that I try to spread ripples of community and peace where I am, here in Sacramento. I&#8217;ve taught thousands of students, and many of them are better people now, because I taught them to be kinder and more patient with themselves. That&#8217;s the best way I know to respect Frank&#8217;s memory, is to continue being a teacher and husband and father from a place of love and strength.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>In Memory</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank&#8217;s memory will live on at UC Santa Cruz through the numerous former students and colleagues he influenced and through the courses and practices he helped to shape. He is survived by his wife of nearly six decades, Jean Andrews, his daughters Karen and Elizabeth Andrews, his son-in-law Chris Lay, and his grandchildren Laurel and Brooke Andrews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A memorial is being planned for late June or July 2024 and will be announced </span><a href="https://obituaries.tridentsociety.com/obituaries/santa-cruz-ca/frank-andrews-11652562"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when details are available. All will be welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donations in his memory can be directed to </span><a href="https://norriscenter.ucsc.edu/support-us/frank-andrews-fund-for-student-empowerment.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Frank Andrews Fund for Undergraduate Empowerment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Donations will be used to support undergraduate opportunities similar to those provided by the classes Frank designed and taught. The fund will be administered by the Ken Norris Center for Natural History at UC Santa Cruz. Frank and Jean were the first major donors to the Norris Center and instrumental in its creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone wishing to share a memory of Frank publicly can do so </span><a href="https://obituaries.tridentsociety.com/obituaries/santa-cruz-ca/frank-andrews-11652562"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Assistant Professor of Biomolecular Engineering at the UC Santa Cruz Baskin School of Engineering Andy Yeh is taking inspiration from this natural marvel to design new luminescent technology as a tool for biomedical imaging.&#160;<br/><br/>With the support of a four-year, nearly $2.5 million grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Yeh will develop completely artificial enzymes that can produce bioluminescence in the body to enable researchers to image tumors or other diseases that may be present in deep tissues at the preclinical stage.&#160;<br/><br/>In addition to the artificial protein, this project will include the development of a specialized imaging system to enable high-resolution detection of the bioluminescent signal. It will explore how bioluminescence can be used in combination with CAR T-Cell Therapy techniques to better track the effectiveness of these specialized cancer treatments. Yeh will undertake this work in collaboration with UC Irvine&#8217;s Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering Michelle Digman and Professor of Chemistry Jennifer Prescher, and Harvard Medical School&#8217;s Assistant Professor of Immunology Ming-Ru Wu.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Exploring illumination</strong><br/><br/>Since the 1960s, scientists have been investigating the biochemical mechanisms that make some living organisms glow. Scientists discovered that bioluminescence is produced via an enzyme, called luciferase, that catalyzes a chemical reaction that produces photons, or light. Despite their best efforts, researchers have not been successful in effectively transferring every bioluminescence found in nature to glow in human cells.&#160;<br/><br/>Yeh specializes in de novo protein design, the process of creating new proteins completely artificially, as compared to modifying proteins found in nature. He has focused his research around developing artificial luciferases that evade the natural limitations of transferring bioluminescence to human cells and animal models.&#160;<br/><br/>To do this, Yeh developed a computational method that he used to create an enzyme designed to be used to produce light in human cells. The computational method incorporates deep learning algorithms to design highly stable and efficient catalysts for high levels of light emissions.&#160;<br/><br/>Last year, Yeh published evidence of his first de novo luciferase protein, which he named &#8220;LuxSit,&#8221; Latin for &#8220;let light exist,&#8221; in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05696-3">a paper in the journal <em>Nature</em></a>. This was an important proof of concept, showing that it is possible to create proteins that produce light at a similar activity level to what is found in nature.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This is the first example of us designing something that is comparable [in catalytic output] to what nature has,&#8221; Yeh said. &#8220;To design something that is as efficient as native protein, that&#8217;s a benchmark in de novo protein design.&#8221;<br/><br/><strong>Designing for deep tissue&#160;</strong><br/><br/>Now, his research will focus on adapting his bioluminescent protein for deep tissue imaging, for which there is currently a lack of effective methods.&#160;<br/><br/>To optimize the protein for deep tissue imaging, Yeh will engineer the protein to produce light that is shifted toward the far red or infrared end of the light spectrum. Red light is ideal for imaging in deep tissue because it allows for better penetration through the tissue &#8212; if you hold a flashlight to your hand, the light that shows through the flesh will be red, because all the other light is absorbed by the tissue.&#160;<br/><br/>Red-shifting the light will create a much stronger signal that can be picked up by a detector. The researchers hope to attain deep tissue sensitivity that is significantly higher than what is currently possible in the field, which researchers could use to find and track the movement of just a small population of tumor cells that may undergo metastasis and travel through the body.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;We believe that we are able to design a really efficient catalyst that can emit light where not only the brightness is higher, but also we can change the color of the light so it can penetrate through the tissue much more efficiently than other existing bioluminescent proteins that are produced in a lab,&#8221; Yeh said.<br/><br/>A team of engineers at UC Irvine including Digman and Prescher will collaborate with Yeh to develop <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01529-9">a new method of light detection called &#8220;phasor imaging</a>,&#8221; rather than taking the traditional approach of detecting light signals by color. The UCI researchers have proven that this technology can better differentiate light emissions and avoid severe spectral overlap, which makes it difficult to clearly separate light.&#160;<br/><br/>The researchers will also collaborate with Ming-Ru Wu at Harvard University to test their probe in CAR T-Cell Therapy. This is a therapy in which synthetic biologists engineer the T-cells, an important type of white blood cells in the immune system, of a cancer patient so that they can better recognize and fight tumor cells. The lack of a sensitive method for tracking the engineered T-cell in the body is currently a hurdle for this treatment. The team hopes that Yeh&#8217;s new luminescent probes will provide an ideal method to gather information about the activity and efficacy of the treatment while it is being carried out in vivo, helping guide preclinical studies to combat cancers.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a37bf44d8072704604289ff81439b39b"><name>angela-davis-architectural-honors-dw</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><start-date>1707811200000</start-date><display-name>angeladavisarchitecture</display-name><path>/2024/02/angela-davis-architectural-honors-dw</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/angela-davis-architectural-honors-dw</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1707844826157</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1707844826157</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text/><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a380cde88072704604289ff877d09630"><name>architecture-honors-angela-davis</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Distinguished Emerita Professor Angela Davis receives the Ada Louise Huxtable Prize for her contributions to architecture</title><summary>University of California, Santa Cruz Distinguished Professor Emerita Angela Davis has been honored with the Ada Louise Huxtable Prize for her influence on architectural culture.&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Davis, who taught in the History of Consciousness and Feminist Studies departments, is being honored with the 2024 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ada Louise Huxtable Prize for Contribution to Architecture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Angela Davis&#8217;s activism and leadership is as relevant and pertinent to architecture as it has ever been,&#8217;&#8221;&#160; Eleanor Beaumont, deputy editor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Architectural Review, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">said. &#8220;Her work highlights the complicity of architecture as a tool of violence and encourages architects to advocate for spatial justice.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award is bestowed by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.architectural-review.com/w-awards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">W Awards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly known as the Women In Architecture Awards,&#160; in association with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Architectural Review</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architects&#8217; Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The W Awards started a decade ago to raise the profile of women and non-binary people in architecture across the world while calling for respect, diversity and equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her advocacy work and scholarship, Davis draws upon her own experience in the early 1970s as a person who spent 18 months in jail and on trial, after being placed on the FBI&#8217;s &#8220;Ten Most Wanted List.&#8221; She has also conducted extensive research on numerous issues related to race, gender and imprisonment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis&#8217;s latest book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abolition: Politics, Practices, Promises, Volume 1</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be published by Penguin next month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis&#8217;s work has heavily influenced the public conversation about the latest&#160; developments in the realms of architecture. Her book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are Prisons Obsolete?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2003) was explored in detail in </span><a href="https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/ending-mass-incarceration-out-of-the-body-of-a-jail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Komich&#8217;s imagining of a world without incarceration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the November 2021 issue of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Architectural Review.&#160;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another influential piece in the same magazine, L</span><a href="https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/outrage/outrage-architects-should-not-design-without-considering-the-politics-that-they-are-tacitly-sanctioning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#233;opold Lambert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who made the forceful argument that the designers of prisons are complicit in an oppressive system, used Davis&#8217;s work to bolster his position.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We live in a system that craves a dose of self-critique that ultimately reinforces its violent logic,&#8221; Lambert wrote in the essay. &#8220;Architects, often recognised as being part of a relatively liberal profession, are very active in this reinforcing process.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From the design of &#8216;better prisons&#8217; to the participation of other components of what Angela Davis calls the &#8216;prison industrial complex&#8217; (1999), such as police stations or the various other physical apparatuses dedicated to surveillance and policing in our cities, they are complicit in a system that has become expert at suspecting, arresting, and incarcerating impoverished and racialised bodies as a form of governance,&#8221; Lambert continued.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faculty and students, including Davis and UC Santa Cruz Feminist Studies Professor Gina Dent, helped launch the Critical Resistance movement, which is now a nonprofit organization advocating for prison abolition and better conditions inside prison walls. In 1998, Davis and Dent helped organize the first Critical Resistance conference, which is often characterized as the beginning of a new generation&#8217;s activism against the U.S. prison system.</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Davis was inducted into the National Women&#8217;s Hall Of Fame.

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz legacy</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primack's journey at UC Santa Cruz began in 1973. In the early 1980s he emerged as one of the main architects of the modern theory of the universe, Cold Dark Matter. His research has provided profound insights into the formation and distribution of galaxies, revolutionizing our comprehension of the large-scale Universe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, although our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and many other nearby galaxies are disk-shaped, by comparing Hubble and Webb Space Telescope images with their supercomputer simulations, Primack and his colleagues recently discovered that most galaxies start out pickle-shaped because of the filamentary distribution of dark matter in the early universe.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), AAAS, and California Academy of Sciences, Primack continues to be very active in research, supervising graduate students and senior thesis students, and helping lead several international collaborations and scientific organizations. He has hosted the annual Santa Cruz Galaxy Workshop for many years, and he organized and directed the UC High-Performance AstroComputing Center from 2010 to 2015.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astrophysics and beyond</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era where science intersects with policy and public engagement, Joel Primack stands out for his diverse contributions. He played a pivotal role in establishing the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowship program, which has empowered thousands of scientists to contribute to policy-making, creating a lasting impact on both individuals and the broader field of science policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primack has also mentored numerous students, many of whom have ventured into big tech and science policy. He underscores the importance of understanding one's strengths and preferences early in a scientific career, and recognizing when a problem is ripe for solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1988, Primack led the Federation of American Scientists program on space nuclear reactor arms control and helped stop the launching of Soviet reactor-powered satellites. In 2004, as a member of the APS Panel on Public Affairs, he organized and chaired the committee that wrote a critical APS report on President Bush's Vision for Space Exploration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primack also started the program on Science and Human Rights at AAAS. In 1995, he was made a Fellow of the AAAS "for pioneering efforts in the establishment of the AAAS Congressional Science Fellows Program and for dedication to expanding the use of science in policy-making throughout government." He chaired the AAAS Committee on Science, Ethics, and Religion from 2000 to 2002.&#160; He also co-authored a book about the relationship between science and government, and two books about the meaning of the new cosmology.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal triumphs and ongoing contributions</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the realm of astrophysics, Primack's personal journey adds a touch of inspiration. Overcoming a life-threatening battle with pancreatic cancer through pioneering immunotherapy, he not only survived but thrived. His commitment to science, public policy, and the pursuit of knowledge remains unwavering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Primack's life, marked by groundbreaking scientific discoveries and a steadfast commitment to the betterment of science and society, stands as a testament to the enduring impact that a scientist can have on the world.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming discoveries</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in the midst of accolades and a long list of accomplishments, Joel Primack continues to push the boundaries of knowledge. His recent focus on comparing galaxy simulations by the leading computer simulation codes of teams around the world through the international AGORA collaboration, and groundbreaking discoveries challenging the conventional view of galaxy clustering signal an exciting chapter ahead. Primack is also finishing a review of Galaxy Formation for the 2024 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Primack remains committed to advancing scientific knowledge and leveraging it for the betterment of society. His tireless advocacy for evidence-based decision-making and his unwavering dedication to expanding the role of scientists in policy discourse serve as a beacon of inspiration for future generations.&#160; In response to his recognition, Primack remains optimistic about the future. He reflects on the evolving landscape of science, offering insights into the collaborative nature of scientific work, the importance of adapting to emerging data, and the continuous pursuit of understanding the unknown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a young scientist, I was often advised that spending time on social and political issues would be career suicide, and that I should focus solely on research,&#8221; Primack said. &#8220;But I take seriously the social responsibility of scientists and I deeply appreciate being recognized both for my scientific contributions and for my efforts to broaden the opportunities for scientists and scientific societies to help solve the challenges facing our world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 AAAS Abelson Prize not only celebrates a lifetime of achievements but also acknowledges Joel Primack's indelible mark on astrophysics, science policy, and the enduring spirit of scientific inquiry.</span></p>

Connections found, made, and cultivated at UCSC sometimes transcend the academic realm, and create bonds that last a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To celebrate Valentine&#8217;s day, we embark on a heartwarming journey to tell the stories of 14 UCSC alumni who not only earned degrees, but also found love while they were students at UCSC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle and I met at UCSC in January 2011 at a mutual friend's party and bonded over the fact that we both had the same hometown and were both Human Biology majors.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We moved to the East Coast together where Kyle finished medical school and residency, and I pursued my career in the biotech industry.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got married in March 2021 and had an intimate ceremony at Henry Cowell State Park to always remember the city where we met and fell in love!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had noticed Gina around Porter College a few times before we met. She had short electric orange hair and as a Sophomore, she was way too cool for me to approach as a newly minted freshman! Our paths finally crossed when I decided to direct a Candyland piece for the Queer Fashion Show at Porter. I was searching for a King Candy and our mutual friend Travis told me he had the perfect King Candy for me. Fast forward six months and we moved in together and have never been apart since. Twenty years later, I&#8217;m happy to report that I&#8217;m married to my best friend.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After graduating in 2005, we moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and started our careers in higher education. We&#8217;ve had lots of adventures and share a love of treasure hunting, eating good meals, and enjoying nature.&#160; We&#8217;re now lucky to call San Diego, CA our home! We both work at the University of San Diego. Our time at UCSC truly was a magical one that changed both of our lives for the better and we wouldn&#8217;t trade it for the world!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payton and I met on the first day of move-in day at Rachel Carson College (then College 8) in the fall of&#160; 2011. We lived three doors from each other on the same dorm floor of CL. We had the same friend group and the same major (psychology). We became a couple in November of that year and the rest was history!&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2019 Payton proposed to me on the Oakes path while we were visiting Santa Cruz. A couple months later in April 2019, I also proposed to Payton in front of the dorm where we first met. After wedding postponements due to the pandemic, we finally got married in September 2021, after 10 happy years together.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update: Kathleen and Payton are welcoming their first child in April!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raul and I met during our first year at UC Santa Cruz at the Dolores Huerta dorm building in Oakes College in 2014. When we first met we didn't know we both had gone to school 300 miles away from home to only find out we lived four miles away from each other back in LA.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been together ever since and recently got married in Nov. 2021. Raul and I graduated in 2018 and are forever grateful for the amazing friends and time we spent as undergrads.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university, and the city itself, holds a very special place in our hearts. So much so, that we even decided to elope in Santa Cruz in September 2020 after having to cancel our traditional wedding celebration due to the ongoing pandemic.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love UCSC and feel so lucky to have had such an awesome undergrad experience there! Slugs forever!&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<p><span>Ecology Project International is pleased to announce that Gabriella Goss, a film student at the University of Santa Cruz, has been awarded a $500 Alumni Leadership Award for her outstanding project proposal titled "Building Bridges Between Ecosystems: An Exploration and Awareness Campaign for Wildlife Crossings." </span></p>
<p><span>Gabriella Goss, a passionate filmmaker, grew up in a suburban area of California and frequently witnessed the tragic consequences of wildlife-vehicle collisions during her travels through various natural landscapes. Motivated by her love for the environment and storytelling, Gabriella is determined to address the issue of habitat fragmentation caused by our society's over-reliance on automobiles. </span></p>
<p><span>Her project draws inspiration from her Ecology Project International (EPI) course experience in the Galapagos Islands, where she witnessed the thriving wildlife in an ecosystem largely spared from human interference. This prompted her to explore the negative impact of human activities on animal habitats, specifically focusing on the millions of animals killed annually by vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span>The documentary film Gabriella plans to create will shed light on the need for wildlife crossings, showcasing existing and under-construction crossings in California. By raising awareness about the dire consequences of road- related wildlife fatalities, she aims to inspire action and contribute to the conservation of animal populations. </span></p>
<p><span>"I want this film to be a call to action," says Gabriella. "While we may not eliminate animal fatalities entirely, we can work towards significantly reducing the numbers by advocating for and building more wildlife crossings." </span></p>
<p><span>The project's results and knowledge obtained will be disseminated widely through the powerful medium of film, shared across social media platforms, film festivals, and websites. Gabriella anticipates impacting a broad audience, fostering a deeper understanding of the urgency to address the human impact on animal habitats. </span></p>
<p><span>"I believe the film medium allows for extensive outreach and engagement," Gabriella explains. "By sharing this documentary through various channels, I hope to inspire individuals to take an active role in advocating for more wildlife crossings both in the United States and beyond." </span></p>
<p><span>The Alumni Leadership Award funds will contribute to the production of the documentary, covering costs associated with research, filming, and editing. In the event of partial funding, Gabriella is prepared to explore alternative funding sources such as grants or crowdfunding, ensuring the successful completion of her impactful project. </span></p>

She is a key advocate for the empowerment and visibility of the Latinx community, leaving an indelible mark on the literary landscape and beyond</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grande&#8217;s bestselling memoir, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Distance Between Us</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, chronicles her life before and after she arrived in the United States from Mexico as an undocumented child immigrant.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am very grateful for this book because, on a personal level, it was this book that set me free,&#8221; Grande said. &#8220;It helped me to reframe the way I saw my immigrant experiences. It empowered me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the book was released in 2012, Grande had been laid off from her teaching job with the Los Angeles Unified School District, and worried about how she was going to support her family. Then, thanks to word of mouth, the book began to take off and became a bestseller. With that came the financial stability Grande needed to keep writing.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The much-anticipated sequel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dream Called Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was released in 2018.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grande has received an American Book Award, the El Premio Aztl&#225;n Literary Award, and the International Latino Book Award. Her work has appeared in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times, the Dallas Morning News, CNN, The Lily at The Washington Post, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Buzzfeed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others.&#160;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Giving back to her alma mater</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grande established the Reyna Grande Scholarship at UCSC to support students seeking to amplify Latinx culture.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scholarship is awarded annually to two students&#8211;one from Kresge and another from any college&#8212;for creative projects intended to advance the standing and visibility of Latinx culture and history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through her scholarship, Grande wants to tell emerging artists currently at UCSC: &#8220;I believe in you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want them to develop confidence in themselves,&#8221; she said. &#8220;To not be afraid to try out their ideas, to take risks, to have fun and enjoy the creative process. I want them to learn how to fight for their art, how to advocate for themselves, how to take the initiative to apply for funding.&#160; Opportunities don&#8217;t usually come to you. You have to go to them. I want them to gain more confidence, and by receiving the scholarship, I think that will give them a good boost!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grande was inspired to create the Reyna Grande Scholarship from her own experience.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-generation and low-income student at UCSC, Grande had difficulty pursuing creative projects. But with the help of a handful of scholarships through Kresge College, she was able to self-publish her first book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Guamuchil Tree, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a collection of short stories, and then received a grant to transform those stories into skits.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having that kind of financial support helped me tremendously&#8212;I learned to embrace whatever creative ideas came my way, to see the possibilities, to pursue those ideas, and to make them into realities. The grants and scholarships I received made me feel that someone believed in me. That helped me believe in myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grande&#8217;s passion for writing began long before she attended UCSC, but the university helped her find her voice.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grande, who learned English as a second language, was the first in her family to go to college.&#160; Her love for writing started in middle school&#8212;through short-stories, self-described cheesy love poems, and journal entries&#8212;especially because she wasn&#8217;t yet comfortable speaking English aloud.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was too self-conscious of my Mexican accent and was afraid to mispronounce a word or conjugate a verb wrong. I preferred writing down my thoughts because you couldn&#8217;t hear my accent then, and it didn&#8217;t matter how a word was pronounced. I was an avid reader, so I knew a lot of English vocabulary, but since I didn&#8217;t know how to pronounce those words, I never used them when speaking, but I used them when writing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the books she had access to weren&#8217;t written by Latinx authors, she never thought she could pursue writing professionally; until, one of her community college professors gave Grande books written by Latina writers, encouraging her to pursue creative writing, and recommended she transfer to UCSC.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grande recalls many memories from her time at UCSC, both difficult and happy ones, and wrote about them in her book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dream Called Home. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She mentions the first time she met an author in the flesh (Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston); participated in her first protest in 1996 when Prop 209 passed, abolishing affirmative action in California; and learned life skills like painting walls, snaking drains, and refinishing furniture through her job with Kresge maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a first-generation student, Grande had to navigate a complex college landscape without the support of her family. For current students that may face similar challenges, Grande offers some advice:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a first-gen student is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing in that you are making history in your family. You are breaking cycles. You are leading the way for change, taking your family on a whole new path. You are laying the groundwork that will benefit generations to come. It&#8217;s a big responsibility, and you are rising to the challenge because if not you, then who? On the downside, it&#8217;s a super lonely experience. You&#8217;re on that path alone, and it&#8217;s scary and overwhelming. Yet, there&#8217;s no one in your family to call and ask, &#8220;How do I do this?&#8221; because no one has ever done it before. You&#8217;re the first, and so you&#8217;re on your own. If you ever felt a distance between you and your family before, you soon discover that your college experience is taking you even further away from them! They will never fully understand your struggles as a college student. But guess what? There are so many others that will&#8212;and this is what my advice is&#8212;find your community. You don&#8217;t have to be alone. Be proactive and use all the resources the campus has to offer, join those clubs, go to the student meet-and-greets, learn to network, and be open to making new friendships. That will get you through those moments when you doubt yourself, when college life feels too daunting.</span></i></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aeb3ec728072704665a564c97bd1a620"><name>featured-student-electronic-music-minor</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Legal Studies major Lauren Elscott found her passion with music and events on campus</title><summary>Lauren Elscott is senior in the legal studies program whose true passion lies in music and events.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elscott enjoys outdoor activities such as the sailing class she is currently taking. But her favorite part of being at UC Santa Cruz so far is all the friends she has made. She describes her roommates, who she&#8217;s collected over the years because of various housing needs, as the people she is closest to.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in her senior year Elscott has found ways to combine her various interests and passions. Despite starting out undeclared, she eventually became a legal studies major because of her interest in intellectual property and copyright. Though she is not planning on going to law school in the fall, she is considering it for her future down the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with her love for the law, Elscott is passionate about music and music production. She started trying to produce music when she was 16. She took History of Electronic Music, a prerequisite for the electronic music minor which focuses on modern music production, and she was inspired to join. &#8220;I feel like a lot of people don't know that the minor exists,&#8221; says Elscott. &#8220;But it's actually a really cool program because you get access to a recording studio on campus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently she is working with local bands in Santa Cruz as part of one of her classes. The bands come to the on-campus recording studio, then Elscott and her classmates get to mix and produce songs. &#8220;That's been really fun, connecting with the community,&#8221; she says. Bands she has mixed this quarter include Star Power and Mutt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her advice to her Freshman self is to join the electronic music minor sooner. &#8220;I was scared about applying because I didn't think I had what it took,&#8221; says Elscott. &#8220;But I think I could have done it my freshman year, and I would have had more knowledge about the studio being on campus and the classes I could have taken.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with her investment in her minor, Elscott also works as a house manager on campus. &#8220;I wanted to find a way to be near music events and arts events,&#8221; says Elscott. &#8220;I wanted to be at the center of the musical action on campus.&#8221; So she joined as an usher in the Fall of 2021. About a year ago she received a promotion, now she helps manage the ushers and the audience facing side of events at a performing arts venue on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back on her years at UC Santa Cruz, Elscott recommends that everyone get as involved on campus, especially in terms of keeping up to date on events. She credits a lot of what she was able to accomplish, her minor or her sailing class, to discovering new things on campus and embracing them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With only a few months left until graduation, Elscott is preparing to take what she learned at UC Santa Cruz and use it for her future life and career. She plans to take the next year to figure out what her next steps are in life, while staying with her parents for a bit. But she already knows she will miss being at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;The campus is just so beautiful, I think I'm going to miss that the most when I leave.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="af03255d8072704665a564c9008ed1f9"><name>nafsa-paul-simon-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz earns national acclaim: awarded NAFSA’s 2024 Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization</title><summary>In recognition of excellence in internationalization efforts, the University of California, Santa Cruz has been selected to receive the prestigious 2024 Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization from NAFSA: Association of International Educators.</summary><start-date>1707984000000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz awarded NAFSA’s 2024 Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization</display-name><path>/2024/02/nafsa-paul-simon-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/nafsa-paul-simon-award</link><created-by>strasilv</created-by><created-on>1708038235466</created-on><last-modified-by>strasilv</last-modified-by><last-modified>1708038235466</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>International</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Division of Global Engagement</name><title></title><phone/><email>global@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/nafsa-paul-simon-award-image-square.png</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/nafsa-paul-simon-award-image-square.png</link><site>news</site><name>nafsa-paul-simon-award-image-square.png</name><display-name>nafsa-paul-simon-award-image-square.png</display-name><file-size>562428</file-size><width>600</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>UCSC international students walk through Quarry Plaza</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/nafsa-paul-simon-award-thumbnail.png</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/nafsa-paul-simon-award-thumbnail.png</link><site>news</site><name>nafsa-paul-simon-award-thumbnail.png</name><display-name>nafsa-paul-simon-award-thumbnail.png</display-name><file-size>16678</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>UCSC international students walk through Quarry Plaza</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><span>International students walk through Quarry Plaza during the Global Learning Opportunities Fair.</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In recognition of excellence in internationalization efforts, the University of California, Santa Cruz has been selected to receive the prestigious <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/about/about-nafsa/senator-paul-simon-award-campus-internationalization">2024 Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization</a> from NAFSA: Association of International Educators.</p>
<p>Granted to only four U.S. universities and colleges this year, the award celebrates institutions that are making significant, well-planned, well-executed, and well-documented progress toward comprehensive internationalization&#8212;especially those using innovative and creative approaches. Comprehensive internationalization is a strategic, coordinated process that seeks to align and integrate policies, programs, and initiatives to position universities as more globally oriented and internationally connected institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meeting the challenges of today&#8217;s world requires the diversity of thought that an international perspective provides,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;This award is a testament to the collective efforts of our campus to offer students a wide range of global research opportunities and learning experiences, and to make internationalization a part of our campus culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the past decade, UC Santa Cruz has experienced rapid growth in international student enrollments. In 2016, the Division of Global Engagement was established to create a broader campuswide structure and to amplify our international efforts. Since then, UC Santa Cruz has achieved remarkable milestones to become a national model for advancing comprehensive internationalization, guided more recently by the <a href="https://global.ucsc.edu/internationalization/">Strategic Plan for Internationalization (SPI)</a> which was adopted in Academic Year 2021-2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;The award acknowledges the Global Engagement team's hard work and dedication. We're thrilled to bring national and international recognition to UC Santa Cruz. I'm excited about the impact this award will have on our future internationalization goals,&#8221; expressed Assistant Vice Provost of Global Engagement and Senior International Officer, Becky George.</p>
<p>Three years into the SPI, UC Santa Cruz has dramatically increased global learning opportunities for students through a commensurate increase in its institutional partnerships around the world. Thanks to innovative new programs and initiatives like Global Internships and Global Classrooms, and expanded Exchange programs and Faculty-Led Global Seminars, student participation in international experiential learning opportunities has surged. For example, in summer 2024 we anticipate a nearly threefold increase in enrollments in the Global Internship program since the program launched in 2021. Similarly, Faculty-Led Global Seminars, launched in 2017 with 12 students, saw 123 students enrolled for summer 2023, and the Global Classrooms initiative has embedded the COIL model for learning in 15 courses at UC Santa Cruz across 14 departments.</p>
<p>Increases in student program participation come as a result of close collaboration with the faculty at UC Santa Cruz. Faculty engagement in new initiatives has nearly tripled since 2021, and a broad range of international partnership agreements have been established with over 50 institutions across more than 15 countries.</p>
<p>Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education and Global Engagement Richard Hughey, expressed gratitude for the NAFSA recognition, stating, &#8220;This award underlines our strengths and builds our reputation as a globally engaged university. Students and scholars who are looking to learn and problem-solve on a global scale will know to seek out UC Santa Cruz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Serving more than 10,000 members and international educators worldwide, NAFSA: Association of International Educators is the leading organization committed to international education and exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pleased to recognize such a diverse and dynamic group of institutions for integrating international education into their teaching, partnerships, systems, culture, and student success models,&#8221; said Fanta Aw, NAFSA executive director and CEO. &#8220;With minority-serving institutions, large land-grant universities, and a community college district counted among this year&#8217;s winners, these institutions demonstrate that the principles and practices of internationalization thrive within a variety of structures, geographies, and student populations. We commend these colleges and universities for their exemplary work in advancing the intercultural skills of their students, faculty, and staff in today&#8217;s dynamic landscape.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b47ead5d80727046065c60c3e1eb0f80"><name>sea-change-bronze-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz awarded SEA Change Bronze Award for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz has been awarded a 2024 STEM Equity Achievement (SEA) Change Initiative Institutional Bronze Award.

The award recognizes the university&#8217;s commitment to long-term, sustainable institutional transformation in support of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM) through self-assessment. Our campus&#8217; commitment to disability inclusion and access was highlighted as a distinguishing feature of our ongoing work and Bronze Award action plan.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an honor to be recognized for work we truly see as foundational &#8212; supporting students, being inclusive of all perspectives and backgrounds, and regularly asking ourselves how we can do better,&#8221; said Chancellor Cynthia Larive. &#8220;An institution is enriched not just by the presence of people with a diverse range of backgrounds, but by their perspectives, experiences and ideas. Our scholarship, research and teaching ultimately benefit, as do the state, nation and world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2018, SEA Change is an initiative of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) that supports institutions undertaking an in-depth self-assessment process to identify barriers to diversity, equity and inclusion for their faculty, which is the current focus, as well as students and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, UC Santa Cruz became one of five new charter members of the initiative, joining seven other institutions around the country. Our campus SEA Change endeavor is a collaboration between UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Office of the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor (CP/EVC) and the Division of Academic Affairs, and is co-chaired by Adrian Brasoveanu, associate campus provost of strategic initiatives in the CP/EVC office, and Herbie Lee, vice provost for Academic Affairs, with the assistance of Veronica Forrette, special projects coordinator in the CP/EVC office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, our campus has made significant strides in DEI work through a variety of initiatives and programs aimed at fostering a campus climate that values diversity and promotes inclusion, and the faculty have been a critical component of these efforts, working collaboratively with campus partners to promote a respectful and thriving environment for all&#8203;,&#8221; said Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity-focused faculty development is a main focus of our SEA Change action plan, which will not only further our teaching and research mission through inclusive excellence across all divisions and disciplines but will also enhance and amplify the essential leadership role our faculty play in these efforts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comprehensive Bronze Award application process that took place over the last two-and-a-half years consisted of a self-assessment, conducted with a wide range of campus stakeholders, a comprehensive narrative summarizing the assessment, and an action plan. This process was a team effort, bringing together representatives from each of the academic divisions and other key campus constituencies. A peer review panel of experts in DEI, systemic and sustainable institutional transformation, and higher education evaluated the application.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the co-chairs, the 2021-22 Change Team included: Larry Andrews, professor of film and digital media; Karlton Hester, Arts Division associate dean of diversity, equity and inclusion and professor of music; Peter Biehl, dean of the Graduate Division;&#160; Yasmin Chowdhury, Graduate Student Association representative; Judith Estrada, assistant vice chancellor of diversity, equity and inclusion; Julian Fernald, director, Institutional Research, Assessment, and Policy Studies; Marcella Gomez, associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion at Baskin School of Engineering and professor of applied mathematics; Abigail Kaun, executive advisor to the dean of Baskin School of Engineering; Kim Lau, professor of literature; Judit Moschkovich, Social Sciences Division associate dean for equity and justice and professor of education; Stefano Profumo, professor of physics; Christina Ravelo, distinguished professor of ocean sciences; Su-hua Wang,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Sciences Division </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">associate dean for research and graduate studies and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">professor of psychology; Elani Zissimopoulos, assistant vice provost and assistant dean of financial and human resources, Undergraduate Education Division. Erika Wolford, executive assistant to the vice provost for Academic Affairs, provided staff support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bronze Award is the first in a series of awards recognizing institutions for their sustained commitment to DEI and transformational DEI work.The award was presented during the annual meeting of the AAAS on February 16 in Denver.</span></p>

Like many others around the world, he was deeply concerned by huge global inequalities in access to testing tools, vaccines, and other biomedical counter-measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a scholar of geopolitics, globalization and global health security, Sparke has studied how the power of the biopharmaceutical industry has grown at the expense of global public health, often leaving people around the world without affordable access to life-saving medications. However, he also believes that portrayals of &#8220;Big Pharma&#8221; as a political boogeyman obscure an important truth: that the industry is not acting alone.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his latest paper, published in the journal </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2024.2304180"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Political Economy</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sparke and his coauthor, Owain Williams, use the case of COVID to demonstrate both the enduring problem of bio-pharmaceutical monopolies and the ways they have been extended and entrenched through complex market-state interconnections. They argue that the global power of the biopharmaceutical industry has, in fact, been built and maintained by a web of corporate, governmental, and philanthropic ties. For the same reasons, efforts to bring the production of medicines back into alignment with the public good will require changes in each of those three realms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you look closely at the pandemic response, you can see a lot of failures, even in some of the things that were narrated as successes,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;And you can also see how the idea of monopoly power that most people have in their minds&#8212;of cigar-smoking corporate executives in a back room plotting to fix prices&#8212;is really inadequate for understanding the multi-faceted and structural nature of the collusion problems surrounding and supporting the biopharmaceutical industry.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Corporate coordination</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper explains that, in the corporate realm, biopharmaceutical companies can coordinate together in perfectly legal ways that concentrate and maintain the power of the largest companies. Ordinarily, this often comes in the form of mergers and acquisitions that take out potential competitors through so-called "killer acquisitions". In the context of the pandemic, global investment firms that hold shares in the world&#8217;s largest biopharmaceutical companies additionally encouraged these companies to work together on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. But the biopharmaceutical giants then maneuvered to lock out participation from smaller companies.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, the paper points to the large number of patents that Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech took out related to mRNA, in order to keep that technology held within their inner circle. The paper also discusses how Moderna has consistently failed to share information about their mRNA platform with firms from the Global South, despite promises to do so. And Moderna initially refused to allow the involvement of such firms even in the packaging process for vaccines, during a time when increased capacity was needed, the paper says.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Governmental enablement</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper argues that much of the corporate consolidation of power was enabled by government policies. For example, in the United States, Operation Warp Speed invested $18 billion of public funding into private biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate vaccine development, and the initiative was hailed as a success when viable vaccines were produced. But then the Trump Administration allowed the successful companies to privatize the publicly-funded innovations with patents. And that&#8217;s where the picture gets more complicated.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government ended up giving free license to these companies to take possession of intellectual property that was generated by public investment,&#8221; Sparke explained. &#8220;That put the vaccine behind a paywall, and as a result, many lives were lost in places like Mexico and Sri Lanka that could have been saved with better access to vaccines.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper also discusses how the tight control of vaccine-related data by private companies has become a barrier to additional innovation that could potentially deliver a more effective sterilizing vaccine or even stop the spread of disease and further mutations of the virus. Yet governments in many wealthy countries continue to prioritize the intellectual property rights of companies. Sparke and Williams describe how this played out at the World Trade Organization, where South Africa and India led a push to waive intellectual property rights related to the vaccine, but European countries organized to weaken the waiver, even after the Biden administration advocated for it.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Justification through philanthropy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments may feel justified in such actions because the philanthropic sector often presents itself as an alternative for meeting public health goals without waiving intellectual property rights. In this way, philanthropy itself contributes to maintaining the power of the biopharmaceutical industry, the paper argues.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the coronavirus pandemic, the COVAX initiative, backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and supported by many well-meaning donors, aimed to leverage philanthropic funding to ensure access to vaccines for low-income countries. But, the program fell far short of its targets, leaving massive equity gaps in global vaccine access. The paper argues that COVAX&#8217;s approach ultimately prioritized saving intellectual property rights ahead of saving lives. And because COVAX lobbied so hard to become the official global approach to vaccine equity, the competing idea of making the vaccine open access couldn&#8217;t get traction, the paper says.&#160;</span></p>
<h2>Consequences and alternatives<strong>&#160;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Sparke says the pandemic showed how big philanthropy, government, and corporations all work structurally on a global scale to preserve the power of the biopharmaceutical industry. And the paper argues that this power dynamic contributed to unnecessary loss of life, public distrust in science, and vaccine skepticism. But there are clear pathways to change.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper discusses some examples from the Biden Administration of how a renewed focus on anti-trust regulation could make a difference, including the Inflation Reduction Act&#8217;s efforts to allow the US government to negotiate lower drug prices. Sparke and Williams also argue for the need to reconsider the status quo around intellectual property rights. Sparke says public universities can play a role in that process by making biopharmaceutical advances and providing open access to them, the same way that UC Santa Cruz has led efforts to provide free open and global access to human genome data with its </span><a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genome Browser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparke hopes that better understanding of the forces behind the biopharmaceutical industry&#8217;s power and the available alternatives could help move people toward productive civic action.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There were so many conspiracy theories around the vaccines that were all totally untrue, but as social scientists, we still need to ask ourselves why so many people were paranoid about a billionaire philanthropist like Bill Gates being so involved in vaccination efforts,&#8221; Sparke said. &#8220;Distinct from wacky ideas about him putting microchips in the arms of the vaccinated, there were also underlying concerns about the linkages between governments, biopharmaceutical firms, and philanthropy. And one of the goals of our paper is to offer a vocabulary and framework for people to talk about those problems without falling prey to conspiracy theories.&#8221;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c6df4b218072704622dd6c556f3bb4bd"><name>slugcast-feb-5-121</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Now streaming: Slugcast, UCSC's official podcast</title><summary>Hosted out of the Student Affairs and Success divisional office, Slugcast is the official UCSC podcast. </summary><start-date>1707811200000</start-date><display-name>Now streaming: Slugcast, UCSC's official podcast</display-name><path>/2024/02/slugcast-feb-5-121</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/slugcast-feb-5-121</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1708438539020</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1708438539020</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/sammy-slugcast_rgb-300dpi.png</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/sammy-slugcast_rgb-300dpi.png</link><site>news</site><name>sammy-slugcast_rgb-300dpi.png</name><display-name>sammy-slugcast_rgb-300dpi.png</display-name><file-size>2725784</file-size><width>2700</width><height>2700</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/slugcast-clip.png</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/slugcast-clip.png</link><site>news</site><name>slugcast-clip.png</name><display-name>slugcast-clip.png</display-name><file-size>12212</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Hosted out of the Student Affairs and Success divisional office, <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/what-we-do/slugcast/index.html">Slugcast</a> is the official UCSC podcast.

Scientists knew of more orderly pleated beta-sheets, but the related, yet distinct rippled sheets were not unambiguously confirmed by observation until 2022, nearly seventy years later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.3c11712"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, scientists from the University of California, Santa Cruz, synthesized peptides from proteins associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s and Type II Diabetes and described five new rippled beta-sheet structures. Previous work showed the formation of rippled sheets in smaller peptides consisting of three amino acids.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This paper increases the scale to peptides of up to seven amino acids. The results suggest that the formation of rippled beta-sheets is a more common process than previously thought.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scientists used peptides from Amyloid beta &#8212; a protein that builds up in the brains of patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s and causes damage to nerve cells &#8212; and amylin, which can build up as amyloid deposits in the pancreas of patients with type II diabetes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structures that these peptides fold into influence how toxic they are, so understanding how to manipulate their shape has important therapeutic implications. Amyloid beta, for example, may be less toxic when organized into fibrils rather than more unstable, disorderly structures called oligomers. With this in mind, the chemists found a way to push the peptides towards forming fibrils rather than oligomers.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To influence the crystallization, they used racemic mixtures, which contain equal amounts of a molecule and its non-superimposable mirror image. This is in contrast to enantiomerically pure substances, which contain only one molecule without its mirror image counterpart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz chemist </span><a href="https://raskatovresearch.sites.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jevgenij Raskatov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had studied crystallization before and used his interdisciplinary background to design the concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew that racemic mixtures often crystalize more easily than enantiomerically pure substances, and amyloid fibril formation is, in many ways, a one-dimensional crystallization,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So if we can enhance crystallization by using mirror images, that means to me that we could potentially enhance amyloid fibril formation using mirror-image-amyloid beta and get protections from toxicity.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">An emerging field</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five structures that the scientists describe form similar rippled patterns with a few key differences between them. Three of the peptides pack tightly together, while the other two contain solvent molecules within their structures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And if you have a system that can encapsulate small molecules, maybe some of those small molecules could be therapeutically interesting,&#8221; said Jevgenij, describing the potential use of rippled beta-sheets for drug delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He expects many more uses for rippled sheets to become apparent soon.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Amyloids are not only toxic substances. Amyloids are also all sorts of materials like nylons and spider silks and god knows what else,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have a hunch, based on what I&#8217;ve seen so far, that there is a very big room behind that curtain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the near future, Jevgenij and the rest of the team will continue exploring the formations and structures of rippled beta-sheets. The Seaver Institute announced in January that it will continue supporting the work with a new $200,000 grant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Without their contributions and donations, this would not have been possible,&#8221; said Jevgenij.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Chemical Society also recently indicated support for the budding field. Chemists will gather at the first rippled sheet symposium on March 17. The conversation has come a long way in just a few years, said Jevgenij.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In 2019 there were not only no crystal structures, people continued to actively doubt that there is such a thing as a rippled sheet,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The progress has not been easily made. The team of researchers spent several months collecting and refining data on the peptide structures for the recent paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a lot of work,&#8221; said Jevgenij. &#8220;Asking the right questions, picking the right sequences, choosing the right conditions and not giving up because it&#8217;s failed however many times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response to the hard work has been overwhelmingly positive. In an email to Raskatov, Samuel Gellman, a leading peptide chemist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, called the work, &#8220;a landmark in experimental characterization of the rippled sheet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for Jevgenij, the progress is personal.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My mother had a stroke which almost killed her when she was 40,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I always had great interest in neuro-degeneration, because I&#8217;ve seen what it does to people and to people&#8217;s children.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the field of rippled sheet chemistry emerges, the scientists expect it to inspire new treatments for Alzheimer&#8217;s as well as uses far beyond.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c73ebef68072704622dd6c559d7b748d"><name>voter-registration-deadline-today</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Deadline to register to vote in March primary is Feb. 20</title><summary>February 20 is the deadline to update your registration online to vote in the March 5 California Primary Election. </summary><start-date>1708416000000</start-date><display-name>Deadline to register to vote in March primary is Feb. 20</display-name><path>/2024/02/voter-registration-deadline-today</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/voter-registration-deadline-today</link><created-by>eelliot</created-by><created-on>1708444794596</created-on><last-modified-by>eelliot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1708444794596</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">February 20 is the deadline to update your registration online to vote in the March 5 California Primary Election.&#160;</span></p>

The University College of the President, after extensive consultation with stakeholders on each of the UC&#8217;s 10 campuses, has created a policy and procedural framework that will offer enhanced protection, support, and resources to the entire UC Santa Cruz community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new policy, Anti&#8211;Discrimination, will be issued systemwide on February 20, 2024. In adopting this policy, the University system and UC Santa Cruz will provide extensive procedural benefits to the UC and Santa Cruz communities while remaining in alignment with the evolving safeguards in federal and California state discrimination, harassment, and retaliation laws.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansive policy includes updated provisions for UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s, and designates EEP as the centralized campus office empowered to receive and respond to any reports of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation that may affect our community. This centralization should ensure that incidents of discriminatory treatment are addressed in a knowledgeable, efficient, and consistent manner. The policy also echoes EEP&#8217;s stated vision of providing education and outreach to promote cooperative understanding of antidiscrimination work, and to cultivate an environment that is welcoming, accessible, and inclusive to all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will find local, UC Santa Cruz-specific guidelines for implementing the new policy here, at EEP's website. As of February 20, all reports of discrimination and harassment based on protected categories should be submitted to EEP. This includes reports involving students, staff, faculty, and third parties. As of February 20, all reports of discrimination and harassment based on protected categories should be submitted to EEP. You can use the reporting form at </span><a href="https://equity.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://equity.ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or email EEP directly at </span><a href="mailto:equity@ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equity@ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While the new policy requires all managers and supervisors to report prohibited conduct, all University community members, including students, staff, faculty, and participants in University affiliated programs, are encouraged to report incidents of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation to EEP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This policy and its related frameworks are a positive step toward developing and sustaining UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s commitment to &#8220;Leading the Change&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please contact EEP (</span><a href="mailto:equity@ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equity@ucsc.edu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) with any questions about applying or implementing the Anti&#8211;Discrimination policy, and please be on the lookout for related programs exploring the new policy&#8217;s coverage, protections, and obligations upcoming from EEP.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c78c9b898072704622dd6c5529dfa096"><name>lizeth-pena-sanchez</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>UCSC student and two time scholarship recipient shares her transformative experiences</title><summary>Lizeth Peña Sanchez (’24, education, democracy, and justice, Latin American and Latino studies, and sociology) received scholarships from The Institute for Social Transformation's Transforming Futures and Building Belonging Programs.

When she discovered an organization doing exactly that, she seized the opportunity. Sanchez spent her summer interning at SLAP Bay Area.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/slap.bayarea/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School and Labor Against Privatization (SLAP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a labor and community coalition formed to defend cities across the Bay Area from those attempting to privatize and gentrify public resources. As an intern, Sanchez participated in a multi-step project conducting and transcribing interviews with teachers from Parker Elementary in Oakland, California. Sanchez says interning with the Schools and Labor Against Privatization Coalition enabled her to build a professional network and reaffirmed her dream of teaching in Oakland.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have learned that the teachers of Oakland do more for their students than teach in a classroom,&#8221; Sanchez said. &#8220;These teachers care deeply about their students and the resources they have access to. I admire the determination that teachers have and I strive to have this attitude in my future career as an Oakland public school teacher.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez&#8217;s internship was made possible through </span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/funding/transforming-futures-internship/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;a program within UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute of Social Transformation&#8212;which provided up to $7,500 scholarship awards in summer 2023 to 12 students from underrepresented backgrounds to allow them to pursue unpaid internships over the summer.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was able to use the scholarship I received from Transforming Futures as my main source of income, allowing me to pay for my expenses while being able to intern at such an amazing organization,&#8221; Sanchez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming Futures opens up opportunities and removes financial barriers for first-generation, underrepresented, and/or low-income students at UC Santa Cruz so they can participate in career-advancing summer internships. All funds for the Transforming Futures Program were made available to students through the generosity and invaluable support of MR Macgill and Ho Nam, whose involvement was motivated by UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s student success initiatives.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I read that original proposal to us, I said, &#8216;Once again, you show me why I love working with UC Santa Cruz.&#8217;&#8221; MR Macgill says, &#8220;Transforming Futures addresses a number of critical issues. The program will teach these students skills that universities don&#8217;t always address. Understanding how to interview, understanding how to write a resume, those are all critical skills.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn&#8217;t the first time Sanchez received a scholarship from the Institute for Social Transformation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sanchez heard about Transforming Futures through Rekia Jibrin, assistant professor of critical studies of education at UC Santa Cruz, and Sanchez&#8217;s mentor in the</span><a href="https://transform.ucsc.edu/funding/building-belonging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Building Belonging Program.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Building Belonging program at UC Santa Cruz fosters student success, increases engagement, and builds a greater sense of belonging for under-represented undergraduate students through faculty-mentored service-learning and research projects. Faculty apply to the program, and if selected, can choose to mentor up to four students per academic year. Student fellows receive $1500 per quarter and are expected to contribute approximately 100 hours per quarter to the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While participating in the Building Belonging Program in 2023, Sanchez was able to craft and conduct a research project centered around how Restorative Justice impacts high school students in Oakland. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">School Youth, Restorative Justice, and Dilemmas of Structural Violence </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">research project, piloted by Jibrin, aimed to prioritize the voices of adolescents who are directly impacted by the school-to-prison pipeline. While working on this project, Sanchez focused primarily on transcribing interviews and using first-level analysis to identify themes across multiple data sets. As a result, Sanchez was able to become more immersed in her community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program prepared me for my career path by opening my eyes to issues happening in the community of Oakland,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Sanchez said during the 2023 Building Belonging student showcase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholarships at UCSC lift the burden of worry and financial barriers students face. It also provides the invaluable resource of time: time to learn, study, fully engage in purposeful careers, and immerse themselves in all that the college experience has to offer. They have far-reaching impacts that go beyond the individuals and families who benefit from them.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sanchez, the scholarships she received from Transforming Futures and Building Belonging reinforced her goals of becoming a teacher in Oakland and supporting future students and community.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;M</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">y experience helped shape me as a future teacher who cares deeply about her students, the community, and the issues they face in the system.&#8221;&#160;</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.santacruzmah.org/exhibitions/sowing-seeds"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sowing Seeds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filipino American Stories from the Pajaro Valley</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will run from April 12 through August 4 at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art And History in downtown Santa Cruz.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are honored to collaborate on and host <em>S</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">owing Seeds," </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Marla Novo, MAH&#8217;s Director of Exhibitions and Programs. &#8220;I'm thrilled to continue building this important partnership with the University of California, Santa Cruz and Watsonville is in the Heart. It brings our community together through public scholarship, local history, and shared experiences.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years in the making, this long-awaited exhibition will tell the story </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Filipino migration and labor in Watsonville and the greater Pajaro Valley of Central California from the 1930s to the present.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition is the result of a prestigious $75,000 Public Humanities Projects: Exhibitions Planning grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/projects/watsonville-is-in-the-heart/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watsonville is in the Heart (WIITH)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Housed in </span><a href="https://thi.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Humanities Institute at </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">UCSC, WIITH is a community-driven public history initiative dedicated to preserving and uplifting the stories of Filipino migration and labor in the city of Watsonville and the greater Pajaro Valley.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We had a shared vision with our community partners from the beginning of our work together that has only kept our efforts focused,&#8221; said Kathleen &#8220;Kat&#8221; Cruz Gutierrez, Assistant Professor Of History at UCSC and </span>co-principal investigator <span style="font-weight: 400;">of WIITH.&#8220;An exhibition has been part of that vision, and we're eager to share perspectives on Filipino American agrarian life that come straight from those who lived, worked, struggled, and flourished in the Pajaro Valley.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the exhibition will focus on oral histories and family heirlooms associated with WIITH. <em>Sowing Seeds</em> will feature 52 family objects and 13 oral histories drawn from 18 family collections including agricultural tools, family photographs, organizational paperwork, and photo albums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those artifacts and stories will give exhibition visitors a candid look at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manong Generation, which consisted mostly of young, single men and some women who left the Philippines looking for work. In Santa Cruz County, they were recruited for low wage farm jobs, where they worked long hours&#160; picking fruits and vegetables and hauling irrigation pipes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the exhibition will also gesture towards the present, featuring contemporary works of art that will give museum goers insightful and sometimes conflicting narratives of belonging, community formation, and memory preservation.&#160;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;These artistic interventions offer an exciting and immersive way of engaging with local history,&#8221; said<strong>&#160;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Christina Ayson Plank, PhD candidate in Visual Studies at UCSC and head curator of Watsonville is in the Heart. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Sowing Seeds</em> will feature installation, photography, illustration, and film. WIITH has invited eight artists engaged in a range of artistic disciplines and mediums to the exhibition, all of whom have worked with or around the importance of archives, memory, and community.&#160; Johanna Poethig and Minerva Amistoso will present works of art about the experiences of the elderly manong and manang generation.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruth Tabancay, an artist who grew up in the Pajaro Valley, has created a new work of art especially for <em>Sowing Seeds</em>, highlighting the experiences of young Filipinas and performing femininity.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binh Danh, Sandra Lucille, Jenifer Wofford,&#160; Ant Lorenzo, who graduated in 2023 with an MFA from UCSC&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Art + Social Practice (EASP) program, and </span><a href="https://havc.ucsc.edu/people/connie-zheng"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connie Zheng</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a PhD candidate in UCSC&#8217;s History of Art and Visual Culture department, have been invited to work directly with community members to produce artworks that investigate their collections and family histories.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WIITH team has previously worked closely with the Pajaro Valley&#8217;s Filipino American community to build a digital archive," Ayson Plank said.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We've gone to their homes and heard stories about their parents, family friends, and relatives that are memorialized through the objects they've kept and preserved."</span></p>
<p><span>WIITH </span><span>collaborates closely with </span><a href="https://www.toberaproject.com/"><strong>The Tobera Project</strong></a><span>, a grassroots organization based in Watsonville. Dioscoro &#8220;Roy&#8221; Recio Jr. of the Tobera Project and Sociology Professor and Director of the Center for Labor and Community Steve McKay initiated a partnership between The Tobera Project and UCSC to celebrate and bring greater awareness to the long-overlooked history of Filipino Americans in the Pajaro Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKay is a co-PI on the WIITH project alongside Gutierrez. With Recio Jr.'s </span>vision<strong>,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the initiative has expanded to include several projects including oral history interviewing, digital archiving, K-12 curriculum development, and most recently, the new exhibition at the Museum of Art &amp; History.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition will be presented at MAH with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Humanities Institute at UCSC, the UCSC Arts Research Institute, the UCSC Arts Division, the UCSC Office of Research, the Monterey Peninsula Foundation, the UCSC Committee on Research, Society of Hellman Fellows, and the Rise Together Fund at Community Foundation Santa Cruz County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition is made possible with the generous contributions of Cristana DeGuzman, Greg Reyes, and George Ow Jr.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned for more information about the </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">public programming series associated with the exhibition, including an event for educators on May 3 when the WIITH team will debut a map of Filipino history in the Pajaro Valley; THI's Night at the Museum on May 29th, which will be focused on Sowing Seeds and will feature public lectures by three scholars of Asian America (Catherine Ceniza Choy, Rick Baldoz, and Rudy Guevarra), a family scrapbooking day on July 13, and a closing poetry reading on August 4.&#160;</span></i></p>

<p>Over the past several years, we have worked collectively as a university community to create a safer, more welcoming learning, working, and living environment for all. These efforts have translated into a number of significant systemwide initiatives that are helping us improve our ability to prevent, detect, and respond to all forms of harassment and discrimination. I want to thank the UC community for your ongoing engagement and thoughtful feedback in these endeavors.&#160;</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m pleased to share another important milestone in this work: the launch of the University of California&#8217;s first&#160;<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucop.edu/civil-rights/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708537075847000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2WmPMtTTzYHV8JtCdnxS5l" href="https://ucop.edu/civil-rights/">Systemwide Office of Civil Rights</a>. This new umbrella office will provide systemwide leadership, guidance and support on issues related to protecting civil rights at our 10 campuses, medical centers, national labs, and the UC Office of the President. It will encompass the existing Systemwide Title IX Office, a new Systemwide Anti-Discrimination Office, and a new Systemwide Disability Rights Office. The executive director of this new office will report directly to me, and we are in the final stages of a national search for this important position. I expect we will be able to announce their appointment in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We are creating the Systemwide Office of Civil Rights proactively &#8211; not in response to any particular incident, but rather in response to feedback from the UC community and based on the recommendation of a systemwide working group charged with developing the University&#8217;s Anti-Discrimination Policy. The working group&#8217;s process was informed by the University&#8217;s Systemwide Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Policy, UC campuses&#8217; current non-discrimination policies, and policies at UC comparator institutions of higher education. The working group found that UC students, staff, and faculty would greatly benefit from centralized oversight of these functions and a more consistent approach to how the University responds to allegations of discrimination and harassment. Recent events on campuses across the country have only reaffirmed the need for such a function. The new office will ensure uniform interpretation and implementation of related UC policies across our locations and provide comprehensive and consistent policies, guidance, training, education, and investigative support to UC offices responsible for preventing and responding to harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected categories such as race, religion, and disability.</p>
<p>We want the University of California to be a fair and just learning, working, and living environment free of discrimination, and we must be responsive when issues arise that hinder us from achieving that goal. The Systemwide Office of Civil Rights will help us do that by supporting and enhancing the critical services that existing campus offices already provide. You can learn more about this new office, including how to get help if you are experiencing harassment or discrimination, here:<span>&#160;</span><a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucop.edu/civil-rights/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708537075847000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2WmPMtTTzYHV8JtCdnxS5l" href="https://ucop.edu/civil-rights/">https://ucop.edu/civil-rights/</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installed in November 2020 by the Coastal Watershed Commission with the support of the City of Santa Cruz, the Patagonia Foundation, and the Ows, a local philanthropic family, the Santa Cruz Chinatown Memorial Archway&#160;symbolizes an important, albeit long forgotten, group of Santa Cruzans from years past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local developer George Ow Jr., who with his family shepherded the dragon into existence, remembers the city&#8217;s Chinatown fondly. In fact, it was where he grew up in the city of Santa Cruz, from 1943 to 1955, back when Santa Cruz&#8217;s Chinatown existed near the archway&#8217;s current location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This area feels like home to me, I feel very comfortable here,&#8221; Ow said, acknowledging the large expanse of the city&#8217;s current downtown.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, February 15, Ow took to the stage at </span><a href="https://www.santacruzmah.org/events/george-ow-talk/2024/02/15"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sharing personal stories of growing up in Santa Cruz&#8217;s fourth Chinatown and how it shaped his perspective of the city into the present. The free 90-minute event was packed, with approximately 200 attendees standing throughout the museum space including along the staircase, to hear Ow&#8217;s story and his conversation with </span><a href="https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/community-archives"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s own Community Archivist Rebecca Hernandez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event was the second in a newly established annual series, headed by Hernandez, called the Community Voices Series. Since taking on the role in January 2022, Hernandez has diligently worked with local community groups and individuals alike to share their oft-overlooked histories in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The basis of what I do is to encourage people to think about the value of their history and their community&#8217;s history, and consider how we can preserve it,&#8221; Hernandez said. &#8220;The absence of those stories means we might never know about the contributions of individuals and community groups, whose hard work made it possible for us to enjoy what they never could.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Ow&#8217;s Life in Chinatown</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ow was born in Santa Cruz in 1943, in the city&#8217;s Chinatown that was located just across the San Lorenzo River, near the county office building off of Ocean and Water streets. This location was the city&#8217;s fourth iteration of Chinatown, established in 1894 and dismantled in 1955. But, for the first 12 years of Ow&#8217;s life, he ingratiated himself in the community, and found a great deal of joy from his upbringing in Santa Cruz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His father, George Ow Sr., had arrived in Santa Cruz to live with his uncle, who owned and operated the Canton Market supermarket at the corner of Cathcart Street and Pacific Avenue. That was the process for many members of the Ow family to arrive in Santa Cruz, Ow shared, with one person offering another a business opportunity and housing. It led to a large swath of Chinese immigrants arriving to the city, and raising first- and second-generation children and grandchildren to carry on in the family&#8217;s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Santa Cruz was a ghetto, but I didn&#8217;t know it. I thought it was the greatest place because my aunts and my uncles, and my grandparents, were here,&#8221; Ow said. &#8220;I thought it was just a place full of love &#8212; this was a great area to grow up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And from his upbringing, it sounded like Santa Cruz was entirely full of love. Ow was one of seven children, but his parents &#8212; who graduated from Santa Cruz High School in 1940 and 1942, respectfully &#8212; never denied them love, adoration, and bonding.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I'm so happy that this is where they ended up, because they had a head start,&#8221; Ow said. &#8220;They bought land, and what a heck of a difference that makes for us to stay here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Sharing historical realities in the present</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ow entered adulthood, he moved around and away from Santa Cruz &#8212;&#160;attending school at Monterey Peninsula College and UCLA, then entering the draft and heading to Vietnam &#8212;&#160;before returning to his long-time home. Since returning to Santa Cruz, Ow has delved more into learning about his past, and worked with locally based historians to garner more information about his family and that of the city&#8217;s Chinatown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Ow gave a special shout-out to two Santa Cruz based historians who have helped to further uncover much of his family&#8217;s history, Geoffrey Dunn and Sandy Lydon, and released books such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Is In The Heart, Chinatown Dreams, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese Gold</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to elaborate on those histories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of his continued favorite aspects of Santa Cruz is returning to the San Lorenzo Riverbed in the summers, and seeing all of the mosaic tiles that local artist and retired teacher Kathleen Crocetti and her Mission High Middle School students have installed throughout the area. Crocetti was also the primary artist behind the 21-foot dragon above the Chinatown Memorial Archway back in 2020.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gail Michaelis-Ow, Ow&#8217;s wife of nearly 45 years, shared that one of her husband&#8217;s top passions is history and the history of his own family: &#8220;He&#8217;s spoken in different places and in front of a lot of different classes, including at Cabrillo and UCSC, but this was certainly the largest venue that I remember.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she said, event attendees were excited to hear about his family&#8217;s history and that it meant a lot to him. Based on the support and encouragement from Thursday&#8217;s event, Michelis-Ow said that Ow would be interested in sharing more about his background to additional groups in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ow is grateful to other Santa Cruzans like Crocetti, Dunn, and Lydon for their continued work to remember his heritage and past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be the history without them &#8212;&#160;it would be lost,&#8221; Ow affirmed. &#8220;What they&#8217;ve done for somebody Chinese like me, it&#8217;s given me a lot of pride, and showed so much that was unknown.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The February 15 event was further supported by </span><a href="https://aapirc.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the UCSC Asian-American/Pacific Islander Resource Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Santa Cruz-based nonprofit </span><a href="https://www.flexkids.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flex Kids Culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and staff from the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History. The event was recorded and will be made available on the UCSC Special Collections &amp; Archives Community Archiving Program webpage in the coming months.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

Hundreds of competitors were warming up with drills, stretches, and rallies. Cheers and shouts echoed from the walls, the lights blazed, and the athletes were serious.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UC Santa Cruz team observed the scene, hugging their traditional giant plushies and doing their mental preparations. They had driven 450 miles to UC San Diego through hellacious traffic and deluges of rain, and their co-captain was sick.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this scrappy group of students had fought and won their way through divisional competitions and made it to the 2023 collegiate table tennis regional tournament&#8212;and they were there to play.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"There were a lot more professional players than at the divisionals, and I could definitely feel that it was way more competitive and serious because people really, really wanted to move on to nationals," said Jing-Ting Lai (Merrill '24, business management economics and psychology).&#160;</span></p>
<h3>Tournament dreams</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table tennis team formed just two years ago as an informal group of students who loved table tennis. Things ramped up very quickly, though&#8212;that February, they went to the divisional tournament at Stanford University, even though they had only trained together for less than a week.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for the rush? One of the team members was graduating soon, and she really wanted to play in the tournament.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We decided to sign up that year, even though most of us were not ready," said Lai, an international student from Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I didn't expect to sign up for a tournament that early," said Yuk Shing Lam, a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying pure math. "I was thinking maybe we can train for a year, and then throughout the year maybe I can also recruit other people. But since one of them was graduating soon, we just tried to help her achieve her dream."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiting team members for that first tournament was challenging. They scrambled to get enough players to form teams, using every resource they had.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"For one team member, I even told her, 'Hey, how about that if you sign up, I'll teach you math,'" said Lam, an international student from Hong Kong.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They got the players, and they went. The 2022 divisional tournament included three other Northern California schools.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I didn't really expect any of the team members to win after just a week's training," said Lam, who played table tennis starting at a young age and during his time as an undergraduate at UC Davis. "And their opponents have been training for their whole life, but I was just happy that I got to see some of my old friends again."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team didn't win any of its games at the 2022 divisional, but they played much better than Lam had expected, which he was "really, really happy about." They got great photos for Instagram and went out for Korean barbecue to celebrate.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We got zero Ws&#8212;zero," said Lai. "But we were very happy at the end because it's just a brand-new experience and we got to meet a lot of Yuk's old friends and his former coach, and we made some connections that went a long way&#8212;and that are still helping us today."&#160;</span></p>
<h3>On the road to regionals</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That divisional experience was just the warm up&#8212;so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team continued training. They recruited more team members, such as Zi Tao Li (Crown '26, robotics engineering), of Honolulu, Hawaii. He had made it his goal to join a sports club during his freshman year, but he didn't make it onto the badminton club. When Lai, who is an RA for Crown and Merrill colleges, hosted a community table tennis tournament, Li was hooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They got one more table, doubling their previous equipment, since they had only one before. They applied to become an official club, though they say the process is lengthy and they haven't finished yet, though they plan to.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two divisionals run by the </span><a href="http://www.nctta.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Collegiate Table Tennis Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that decide if a team qualifies for the regional. In 2022, the UCSC team joined so late that it could only enroll in the second one.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But during the rest of that year, they participated in two more divisionals. The hard work, practice, and dedication paid off, and they qualified to move on to the 2023 regionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They packed two cars with 11 people for the 10-hour drive through the epic atmospheric river storms of late February 2023, slogging through traffic the whole way. They rented an AirBnB with their own funds, went grocery shopping, and cooked dinner. Lam unfortunately fell ill before they left, but he tested negative for COVID-19. He came along, toting board games, but laid low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"So we played games without him because he was dying in the bedroom, but we had a lot of fun," said Lai.</span></p>
<h3>Community and connection</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tournament space at the 2023 regional&#8212;UC San Diego's RIMAC Auxiliary Gym&#8212;was much bigger than the divisional space at Stanford. The regional included schools from all of California plus Arizona and more.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Slugs played hard, and they kept winning&#8212;all the way to the quarter final.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We beat some of the teams that were traditionally strong because we had better strategy," said Lam.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Slug team member who played in the individual category did continue on to nationals&#8212;Wendy Chen (Cowell '24, computer game design). Their goal is one day to have the whole team making it to nationals.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While none of the Slugs playing in the teams category moved on to nationals, they won in so many other ways&#8212;because being part of a team and playing a sport have meaningfully enriched their lives and their student experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"It allows me to be in this community that I really enjoy," said Lai. "Everybody has different physical strength, and different abilities and skill sets. So it's about meeting people where they're at and finding balance between training other people, training myself, and managing my time."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li reflected that while of course they're in college studying and focusing on academics, table tennis is "a really fun activity to connect with people who have the same interests. And also going to practice is really fun."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Lam's part, he said it might sound dramatic, but he feels like playing table tennis reminds him that "I'm still a person."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a student teacher, he goes to math classes, teaches math classes, and has a cubicle office.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"So I'm just there 24/7. I'm practically married to the school," he said, with a laugh. "And being able to play table tennis, I get to go outside of my office. And also sometimes I get to travel with the team, and I get to connect to other people who don't just talk about math."&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, he said, it's also taught him the importance of teamwork, as well as helped him develop leadership and interpersonal skills.&#160;</span></p>

Assistant Professors Roxanne Beltran and Jacqueline Kimmey will each receive $75,000 to delve into new areas of research in their respective fields of marine ecology and microbiology.<br/>
<h2>Elephant seals as climate sentinels</h2>
Beltran, in the Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Department, leads elephant seal research that uses sensors attached to the animals to monitor the world&#8217;s oceans for climate change impacts as they migrate. Beltran also advances the movement toward research experiences that are more inclusive of students from historically marginalized backgrounds through the publication of widely used guidelines on topics such as field safety, anti-racism, and open data.<br/><br/>The Sloan award will now allow Beltran to pioneer new approaches to answer questions about how changing environmental conditions impact populations and marine ecosystems by impacting individual animals&#8217; abilities to survive and reproduce. The award will also provide &#8220;transformative training opportunities for hundreds of undergraduate students, with a focus on underrepresented minority students,&#8221; UC Santa Cruz Professor Rita Mehta, chair of the Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Department, stated in her nomination letter to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.<br/><br/>&#8220;The six-decade research program has laid important groundwork by teaching us that elephant seals undertake extraordinary migrations halfway across the Pacific Ocean, diving to dark depths in search of fish and squid to eat,&#8221; Beltran said. &#8220;With funding from the Sloan Foundation, my team and I can now begin to understand how shifting ocean conditions are impacting food resources for marine vertebrates, and in turn, how their ability to survive and reproduce may be threatened in our changing world.&#8221; <br/>
<h2>Infection&#8217;s Influence on Biological Patterns</h2>
Kimmey, in the Microbiology &amp; Environmental Toxicology Department, focuses on circadian rhythms &#8211; the cellular timekeeping system that regulates sleeping, eating, and a variety of physiological responses &#8211; and how the clock is affected by microbes. She has pioneered several approaches to explore interactions between circadian rhythms and infectious disease. Using cell culture, she recently discovered that exposure to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, can &#8220;reset&#8221; the circadian clock of vertebrates.<br/>

The Sloan award will now allow Kimmey to conduct new research using zebrafish to define how circadian rhythms respond to infection in living organisms. Over the past four years, Kimmey has generated and scaled up breeding of several lines of zebrafish that provide advantages over mice because changes at the cellular, tissue and organismal levels can be monitored concurrently, providing a holistic understanding of disease dynamics in real time.<br/><br/>&#8220;Our circadian clock isn&#8217;t just about sleep &#8211; it affects nearly all biological processes. Clinical data, and honestly, our own personal experiences, tell us that infections can disrupt our normal biological patterns &#8211; you may experience fatigue, sleep more, or lose your appetite,&#8221; Kimmey said. &#8220;With this funding from the Sloan Foundation, we can now investigate how invasive infections such as sepsis and meningitis affect neural circadian rhythms, and one day, hopefully leverage this information to optimize clinical therapeutics and improve disease outcome.&#8221;<br/><br/>Beltran and Kimmey are among 126 early-career scientists in the United States and Canada to be named 2024 Sloan Research Fellows. Open to scholars in seven fields &#8211; chemistry, computer science, Earth system science, economics, mathematics, neuroscience, and physics &#8211; the Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded in close coordination with the scientific community. Candidates must be nominated by their fellow scientists and winners are selected by independent panels of senior scholars based on a candidate&#8217;s research accomplishments, creativity, and potential to become a leader in their field.<br/><br/>Founded in 1934, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation is a not-for-profit grantmaking institution dedicated to improving the welfare of all through the advancement of scientific knowledge.

and UC Santa Cruz Assistant Teaching Professor of Computational Media Samantha Gorman is a key creative mind behind it as the game&#8217;s co-writer and narrative director.<br/><br/>In Stranger Things VR, players explore the psychological horror/action game as series villain Vecna, diving into his transformation into a villain and offering new and never-seen-before perspectives on events from the Netflix series. Players can wield telekinetic powers, build up a formidable hive mind of demo-creatures, open and close portals to other realms, and invade the psyches of other characters such as Will Byers and Billy Hargrove.&#160;<br/><br/>The game is a result of deep collaboration between Netflix and independent creative studio <a href="https://tenderclaws.com/">Tender Claws</a>, where Gorman is the co-lead. Tender Claws has become known for blending original and multi-layered storytelling and critically examining the very technology used in the delivery of that storytelling. The studio has several award-winning projects including the VR game Virtual Virtual reality and the AR mobile game Tendar.&#160;<br/><br/>Gorman specializes in interactive narrative, world building, and directing for games which for this project means that she co-lead the idea for the game, directed voice actors, and led the script&#8217;s writing team. Development on Stranger Things VR began in 2020, giving the Tender Claws team valuable insight into the series&#8217; narrative development for 2022&#8217;s Season 4, which informed the game and allowed them to flesh out the characters. The game is available for play in both VR and mixed reality on the Meta Quest 3, Quest 2, and Quest Pro, with future platforms to be announced.<br/><br/>Gorman, who also is affiliated with UCSC&#8217;s Arts Division, said that this game reflects her passions for interactive narrative, immersive world design, and directing, which she brings to her teaching of UCSC engineering and arts students.&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;This work can only be done at the interdisciplinary edge,&#8221; Gorman said. &#8220;Students from engineering can learn a lot about design and world construction through the mise-en-sc&#232;ne [theatrical design and arrangement] and understanding theater, especially if they are interested in immersive spaces. Students in theater and writing can learn about the physical act of creating worlds and the construction of systems that are used for interactive narrative.&#8221;<br/><br/>Gorman will bring her experience in the interdisciplinary world of VR to the creation of a production on campus in collaboration with students as well as a Spring course that explores the theatrical implications of games and performing with an audience.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to collaborating with faculty and students across the communities of arts and engineering on future work.&#8221;</p>

Lewis College. Lau accepted a three-year provost appointment after having served as interim provost for the colleges throughout the 2023-2024 academic year.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Professor Lau has done a wonderful job in the interim role and has many exciting ideas for the future of the colleges,&#8221; said Social Sciences Division Dean Katharyne Mitchell. &#8220;We look forward to continuing our work with her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://collegenine.ucsc.edu/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://johnrlewis.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John R. Lewis College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are unique among UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s 10 residential colleges in that they are led by a specific academic division. The colleges are open to students from all majors, but they utilize faculty expertise and research initiatives from the </span><a href="https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Sciences Division</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to strengthen academic and co-curricular programming in alignment with the colleges&#8217; themes.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College Nine&#8217;s theme of &#8220;international and global perspectives&#8221; helps students build cultural competency for an interconnected modern world. And John R. Lewis College&#8217;s theme of &#8220;social justice and community&#8221; teaches students to be agents of social change, drawing inspiration from the legacy of the late civil rights icon and U.S. Representative John R. Lewis. Provost Lau said these themes are part of what excites her about working with the colleges.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In this moment, it&#8217;s easy to see how deeply connected we are as a planet, and that makes these themes feel visceral to many people,&#8221; Lau said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for all of us to understand who we want to be in this world, how we can be accountable to each other, and what kinds of change we&#8217;re invested in making. And I love that both colleges work toward that goal by building upon the agency and knowledge that students already have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lau enters her new provost appointment with strong prior administrative experience. She served as provost of Oakes College from 2008-2014, has chaired the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate, and was an associate dean of faculty affairs in the Humanities Division. Her research and teaching interests focus on fairy tales, race, and feminism, including women&#8217;s health activism.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lau says she has long admired the strength of programming at College Nine and John R. Lewis College and the work of the college&#8217;s leadership, including former Provost Flora Lu and Senior Director for College Student Life Sarah Woodside Bury.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a large portfolio of really tremendous programs that Flora and Sarah have built at these colleges over the years,&#8221; Lau said. &#8220;So as incoming provost, I&#8217;m excited to help ensure the sustainability of those existing programs and also to think about how we can leverage some of our resources in new ways.&#8221;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Lau mentioned that she&#8217;d like to expand the </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/12/slug-stories.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program&#8212;through which students write and perform stories about their life experiences&#8212;to include an art exhibition for photo essays, paintings, or graphic art. She also hopes to launch a new program, in collaboration with the Institute for Social Transformation, to help undeclared students explore how different majors might help them build a meaningful life. And she&#8217;s developing partnerships between College Nine and the </span><a href="https://gch.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global and Community Health Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including through an effort to create a new mural in the lobby of Social Sciences 1.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lau said she has enjoyed her work as interim provost for the colleges thus far and is eager to build on that momentum now that she&#8217;s been officially appointed to a three-year term. She is excited to continue working with faculty and staff in the Social Sciences Division and across campus to support student success through the unique living and learning communities of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s residential colleges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The council of provosts has a lot of good ideas right now for how to work together to take advantage of the power of 10 to try out exciting things for undergraduate education,&#8221; Lau said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really looking forward to that work.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d6fae13a807270466bab0a18477253ce"><name>wildfire-stream-chemistry-impact</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Closer water monitoring needed as wildfires increase</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz researchers warn that wildfires can change the chemistry of nearby streams that people and wildlife depend on for drinking water.

However, the researchers found that the baseline water-chemistry data needed to detect such changes aren&#8217;t always available.<br/><br/>&#8220;Wildfires are becoming more common, yet the effects of wildfire on streams and their water quality remain unclear,&#8221; they explain in their <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023WR034940" title="Journal article">recently published study</a>. &#8220;Changes in stream water quality following a wildfire can have consequences for drinking water and aquatic ecosystems.&#8221;<br/><br/>The study, &#8220;Exploring the Complex Effects of Wildfire on Stream Water Chemistry: Insights from Concentration-Discharge Relationships,&#8221; was led by Christina Richardson, a postdoctoral fellow in UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Department of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences. She researches water in coastal, estuary and river systems in the biogeochemical lab run by Professor Adina Paytan.<br/><br/>Understanding the impact of wildfires on stream-water quality is important for effectively planning and managing wildfire-prone areas, the study&#8217;s authors state. Three of the four creeks and rivers that the researchers focused on are used as local drinking water sources for communities nestled in the southern Santa Cruz Mountains, as well as the city of Santa Cruz. <br/>
<h2>Gaining insights from the ashes</h2>
Specifically, one month after the CZU Lightning Complex Wildfires &#8211; that destroyed over 86,000 acres across Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties in 2020 &#8211; Richardson and her colleagues began collecting samples at four different watersheds impacted by the massive, month-long fires. Over the course of two years, her team ventured into the ravaged mountains and measured stream-water chemistry, coupled with analysis of burned soils and ash from the same areas.<br/><br/>They measured for more than 20 different elements, including arsenic and lead. And while the study didn&#8217;t find changes in stream-water chemistry that would be harmful to humans, Richardson said the ability to make that finding was a significant accomplishment in itself &#8211; made possible by the many partnerships they formed with local and federal organizations to access what baseline chemistry and water-flow data were available. <br/><br/>&#8220;These collaborations on this project really showcase how multiple organizations and groups can come together with a shared purpose that benefits our local community and science at large,&#8221; the researchers wrote. Such effective partnerships between researchers and public agencies don&#8217;t always occur, Richardson said.<br/>
<h2>More proactive water monitoring needed</h2>
However, they were not able to report definitive water-chemistry changes at one of the sites studied due to a lack of data on chemical levels prior to the fire &#8211; the kind of valuable information that would be collected if ongoing water-quality monitoring were more commonplace. With climate change raising the incidences of wildfires and the harms they inflict on surrounding communities, Richardson said this study highlights the importance of more routine water-chemistry monitoring.<br/><br/>&#8220;Our understanding of how disturbances like wildfire impact stream water quality is limited by a paucity of pre-fire data,&#8221; Richardson explained. &#8220;Without these baselines, it is challenging to understand not only the primary drivers of post-fire change in aquatic systems, but also to even define what constituents are changing in terms of stream-water quality. <br/><br/>&#8220;This study is helping to fill this critical data gap as wildfires become more common due to climate change and shifts in land-management practices,&#8221; she added.<br/><br/>Going forward, the next step in this line of research is for deeper exploration of why water-chemistry changes are influenced by so many variables: from a watershed&#8217;s topological features, to flow-volume fluctuations, and even the time of year. Ultimately, Richardson said these insights are critical for effective planning and management of water resources as wildfires become more frequent.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://paytanlab.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Paytan Biogeochemistry Lab</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d7af6a7b807270466bab0a186be31ea9"><name>annual-notice-reporting</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Annual notice on employees responsible for reporting discrimination, sexual violence or sexual harassment</title><summary>To promote a healthy campus climate, we encourage everyone in our community to report incidents of sexual violence, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation to EEP.</summary><start-date>1708588800000</start-date><display-name>Annual notice on employees responsible for reporting discrimination, sexual violence or sexual harassment</display-name><path>/2024/02/annual-notice-reporting</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/annual-notice-reporting</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1708720613995</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1708720613995</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>UC Santa Cruz strives to create and sustain an equitable environment for students, staff, and faculty.</span></p>

<h3><span>Reporting sexual violence and sexual harassment to the Title IX Office</span></h3>
<p><span>The Title IX Office plays a critical role by fostering a campus climate in which members of our community are protected from all forms of sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual exploitation, invasions of sexual privacy, and relationship violence. Sexual violence and sexual harassment have no place on our campus. Ensuring prevention and appropriate referral of all allegations is a shared responsibility, and we are grateful to all of you who have collaborated, consulted, and supported this work.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of the Title IX Office at UC Santa Cruz is to serve as a support resource for students, staff, and faculty who may have experienced sexual violence and sexual harassment.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Responsible Employee Are Required to Report</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Most employees&#8211;with the exception of confidential employees (Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS), CARE, &amp; Employee Assistance Program (EAP)), are required to report to the Title IX Office if they learn about sexual violence or sexual harassment that involves a student. Supervisors and managers, faculty, HR, Academic Personnel administrators, and campus police must also report if they learn that a university affiliate may have experienced possible misconduct under the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708790974328000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FCtKf9t-OBFQKiWDPn-D7" href="https://www.ucop.edu/title-ix/resources/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SVSH Policy</a>. We have an <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://uctitleix.i-sight.com/portal&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708790974328000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0j3tIreOWnBQvoKIXrW7l6" href="https://uctitleix.i-sight.com/portal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online reporting form</a>&#160;you can use to fulfill your reporting responsibilities, receive confirmation of your report, and ensure we can respond quickly. Our office is more than happy to meet with you for a consultation if you have any questions or concerns.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Employee Support</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Title IX and EEO offices are not emergency response organizations and observe regular business hours. These offices respond timely to reports, provide safety and supportive measures as needed, and work with the complainant to determine how to proceed. By reporting to EEP, you help us connect with parties that need resources and support and provide us with important information for addressing safety concerns on campus.</span></p>
<p><span>We encourage staff and faculty to reach out for support. Equity &amp; Equal Protection is a resource for staff and faculty as well as students. You can contact EEP to receive support or to assist others in gaining support from our office. Our ultimate goal is to foster a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for learning, living, teaching, researching, and working.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Julie Lewis, Title IX Director and Samara Winbush, EEO Director</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="d7f8b1a2807270466bab0a18f93b38ee"><name>fossil-coral-climate-change</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><title>Scientists begin to crack open climate-change riddles hiding in ancient coral</title><summary>An international team of researchers on an expedition co-led by UC Santa Cruz Professor Christina Ravelo collected cores of fossil coral off the coast of Hawai'i to look for signs of climate and sea-level change over the past half million years.</summary><start-date>1708675200000</start-date><display-name>Signs of climate change in ancient coral</display-name><path>/2024/02/fossil-coral-climate-change</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/fossil-coral-climate-change</link><created-by>mivpena</created-by><created-on>1708725416325</created-on><last-modified-by>mivpena</last-modified-by><last-modified>1708725614962</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ocean Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Mike Peña</name><title></title><phone/><email>mivpena@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/hawaiian-coral-research.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/hawaiian-coral-research.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hawaiian-coral-research.jpg</name><display-name>hawaiian-coral-research.jpg</display-name><file-size>120051</file-size><width>760</width><height>507</height></image><image-alt>Researcher with tubes of coral cores</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2024/02/images/hawaiian-coral-research-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2024/02/images/hawaiian-coral-research-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hawaiian-coral-research-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hawaiian-coral-research-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>7703</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Expedition leaders in front of research vessel</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>An international team of researchers collected fossil coral cores to examine signs of historic climate and sea-level change.

Clues to those mysteries and others may be sunk deep in our oceans, documented within fossil coral similar to how tree rings record changes in precipitation on land.<br/><br/>Now, scientists will begin to unlock those fossilized secrets, thanks to an ocean expedition co-led by UC Santa Cruz Professor Christina Ravelo. On February 22, the international team of researchers announced that they have obtained a &#8220;high-resolution continuous record&#8221; of environmental data from ancient reefs off the coast of Hawai&#8217;i. In total, they collected almost 1,400 feet of coral from depths ranging from about 400 to 4,000 feet.<br/><br/>&#8220;We are also delighted to have recovered many samples of annually banded fossil corals that will be used to obtain, for the first time, detailed records of monthly changes in oceanographic conditions from past periods that were different than today,&#8221; said Ravelo, a professor of ocean sciences. &#8220;The idea is to use this data to inform predictions of future Pacific-wide climate change.&#8221;<br/>
<h2>Letting coral speak</h2>
The coral has been opened, analyzed, and sampled by the researchers, and in the months ahead, they will use cutting-edge methods in their labs to extract more information from the cores about sea-level and climate changes. They hope to better understand the mechanisms that cause such phenomena, including abrupt events, as well as the impact of these changes on reef growth and health.<br/><br/><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2023/10/hawaiian-reefs.html">The &#8220;Hawaiian Drowned Reefs&#8221; expedition</a> was part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), a publicly funded collaborative supported by 21 countries, which explores Earth's history and dynamics recorded in seafloor sediments and rocks &#8211; as well as monitoring sub-seafloor dynamics. The expedition was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD).<br/><br/>The expedition team included 31 scientists of different disciplines from around the world. Ten of them sailed aboard the multipurpose vessel MMA Valour in September and October 2023 off the coast of Hawai&#8217;i, using a remote-controlled system to collect the coral cores. Cameras were mounted on the system so the researchers could see and avoid any live coral, which rarely grow at the depths where they were collecting the cores, Ravelo said.<br/><br/>After that offshore phase of the expedition, the entire team met in Germany, at the Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, at the University of Bremen, to begin interpreting the data from the coral skeletons.<br/><br/>The team of scientists will continue to work on the samples and data in the coming years at their home laboratories during this onshore phase of the expedition. Then, after a one year-moratorium, the material and data will be archived and made accessible to the international scientific community for further scientific research, with findings expected to be published in the months and years ahead.<br/><br/>&#8220;We were able to recover a spectacular sequence of fossil coral-reef deposits that will enable us to decipher in unprecedented detail how sea level, paleoclimate, and the reef ecosystem has changed over the past 500,000 years, particularly during periods of rapid global change,&#8221; said Jody Webster, a geosciences professor at the University of Sydney, Australia, who co-led the expedition alongside Ravelo.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><calling-page><system-page current="true" id="5a19cad6807270462e6333674524c814"><name>index</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1708869232275</last-published-on><last-published-by>system</last-published-by><start-date>1706778000000</start-date><path>/2024/02/index</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2024/02/index</link><created-by>ttran34</created-by><created-on>1702318688973</created-on><last-modified-by>ttran34</last-modified-by><last-modified>1704126459187</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><page-xhtml/></system-page></calling-page></system-index-block>
